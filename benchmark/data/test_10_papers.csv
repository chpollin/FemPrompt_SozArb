            The successful irruption of AI-based technology in our daily lives has led to a growing educational, social, and political interest in training citizens in AI. Education systems now need to train students at the K-12 level to live in a society where they must interact with AI. Thus, AI literacy is a pedagogical and cognitive challenge at the K-12 level. This study aimed to understand how AI is being integrated into K-12 education worldwide. We conducted a search process following the systematic literature review method using Scopus. 179 documents were reviewed, and two broad groups of AI literacy approaches were identified, namely learning experience and theoretical perspective. The first group covered experiences in learning technical, conceptual and applied skills in a particular domain of interest. The second group revealed that significant efforts are being made to design models that frame AI literacy proposals. There were hardly any experiences that assessed whether students understood AI concepts after the learning experience. Little attention has been paid to the undesirable consequences of an indiscriminate and insufficiently thought-out application of AI. A competency framework is required to guide the didactic proposals designed by educational institutions and define a curriculum reflecting the sequence and academic continuity, which should be modular, personalized and adjusted to the conditions of the schools. Finally, AI literacy can be leveraged to enhance the learning of disciplinary core subjects by integrating AI into the teaching process of those subjects, provided the curriculum is co-designed with teachers.",journalArticle

Per comprendere le implicazioni e i meccanismi sottostanti, è essenziale acquisire una comprensione ampia dei suoi benefici e svantaggi. A questo scopo, l'alfabetizzazione all'IA è un fattore fondamentale per promuovere atteggiamenti più consapevoli verso lo sviluppo dell'IA e delle sue implicazioni. Tuttavia, la ricerca sulla literacy all'IA è ancora agli esordi. Per contribuire ai progressi del settore, questo articolo presenta i risultati di uno studio volto a valutare l'alfabetizzazione all'IA degli studenti nel contesto dell'istruzione universitaria, concentrandosi su dei dottorandi. L’indagine sulla loro literacy all’IA è stata condotta su quattro dimensioni: cognitiva, operativa, critica ed etica. I risultati mostrano che, sebbene i partecipanti avessero poca conoscenza dell'IA, erano eccessivamente fiduciosi nelle capacità della tecnologia. Lo studio evidenzia la necessità di un approccio più completo all'alfabetizzazione all'IA, che includa una comprensione più profonda delle sue implicazioni etiche, sociali ed economiche.",journalArticle

(2025),"Chee, Hyunkyung et al.",2025,10.1111/bjet.13556,https://bera-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjet.13556,"This study aims to develop a comprehensive competency framework for artificial intelligence (AI) literacy, delineating essential competencies and sub‐competencies. This framework and its potential variations, tailored to different learner groups (by educational level and discipline), can serve as a crucial reference for designing and implementing AI curricula. However, the research on AI literacy by target learners is still in its infancy, and the findings of several existing studies provide inconsistent guidelines for educational practices. Following the 2020 PRISMA guidelines, we searched the Web of Science, Scopus, and ScienceDirect databases to identify relevant studies published between January 2012 and October 2024. The quality of the included studies was evaluated using QualSyst. A total of 29 studies were identified, and their research findings were synthesized. Results show that at the K‐12 level, the required competencies include basic AI knowledge, device usage, and AI ethics. For higher education, the focus shifts to understanding data and algorithms, problem‐solving, and career‐related competencies. For general workforce, emphasis is placed on the interpretation and utilization of data and AI tools for specific careers, along with error detection and AI‐based decision‐making. This study connects the progression of specific learning objectives, which should be intensively addressed at each stage, to propose an AI literacy education pathway. We discuss the findings, potentials, and limitations of the derived competency framework for AI literacy, including its theoretical and practical implications and future research suggestions.

              Harnessing new digital technologies can improve access to health care but can also widen the health divide for those with poor digital literacy. This scoping review aims to assess the current situation of low digital health literacy in terms of its definition, reach, impact on health and interventions for its mitigation.
            
            
              Methods
              A comprehensive literature search strategy was composed by a qualified medical librarian. Literature databases [Medline (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), Scopus, and Google Scholar] were queried using appropriate natural language and controlled vocabulary terms along with hand-searching and citation chaining. We focused on recent and highly cited references published in English. Reviews were excluded. This scoping review was conducted following the methodological framework of Arksey and O’Malley.
            
            
              Results
              A total of 268 articles were identified (263 from the initial search and 5 more added from the references of the original papers), 53 of which were finally selected for full text analysis. Digital health literacy is the most frequently used descriptor to refer to the ability to find and use health information with the goal of addressing or solving a health problem using technology. The most utilized tool to assess digital health literacy is the eHealth literacy scale (eHEALS), a self-reported measurement tool that evaluates six core dimensions and is available in various languages. Individuals with higher digital health literacy scores have better self-management and participation in their own medical decisions, mental and psychological state and quality of life. Effective interventions addressing poor digital health literacy included education/training and social support.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Although there is interest in the study and impact of poor digital health literacy, there is still a long way to go to improve measurement tools and find effective interventions to reduce the digital health divide.",journalArticle
