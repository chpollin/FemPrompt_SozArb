# Summary: Linnemann 2023 Bedeutung

## Overview

This German-language academic forum article by Linnemann, Löhe, and Rottkemper (published June 2023, accepted May 2023) addresses the growing importance of Artificial Intelligence in social work, with particular emphasis on Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies. Published across multiple institutional affiliations (Katholische Hochschule NRW, FH Münster), the work contributes to emerging scholarly discourse examining how AI applications—particularly ChatGPT and similar NLP systems—intersect with social work practice, professional identity, and client outcomes. The authors argue that NLP deserves focused attention within social work scholarship because language processing is fundamental to communicative processes that define social work practice. Rather than adopting either techno-optimistic or pessimistic positions, the article pursues a theoretically-grounded critical analysis that acknowledges both opportunities and significant risks associated with AI integration into social services across multiple practice domains including child/youth care, elderly care, and counseling services.

## Main Findings

The article identifies a dual-sided landscape of implications for social work across specific practice domains. Regarding child/youth care, elderly care, and counseling services, NLP technologies offer substantial opportunities: they can democratize access to social services by reducing barriers for marginalized populations, enable low-threshold entry points for vulnerable clients, and facilitate decision-making through access to broader data bases. These benefits align with social work's fundamental commitment to social justice and inclusion. Conversely, the authors identify critical concerns centered on modularization—the fragmentation and extraction of genuine social work activities (relational engagement, ethical judgment, holistic assessment) into discrete algorithmic components. This risk threatens to reduce relationship-centered practice into mechanistic processes, potentially compromising the profession's human rights orientation and ethical foundations. The analysis reveals that NLP's ultimate value depends entirely on whether implementation maintains social work's core professional values or allows technological determinism to reshape practice fundamentally. ChatGPT and similar systems exemplify this tension: while offering accessibility, they risk replacing professional judgment with algorithmic responses.

## Methodology/Approach

The article employs a conceptual-analytical methodology rather than empirical research design, systematically examining theoretical implications across practice domains. Two primary theoretical frameworks structure the analysis. Staub-Bernasconi's Action Theory (2018) provides the foundational lens for examining how NLP aligns with or diverges from social work as a science of action, ensuring that technological applications are evaluated against established professional theory and values. Media Equation Theory (Nass & Reeves) complements this framework by analyzing how clients perceive and interact with NLP systems, examining psychological gratification mechanisms and social interaction effects. This dual-theoretical approach enables systematic examination of implications across different social work fields, moving beyond abstract technological discussion toward concrete professional practice considerations.

## Relevant Concepts

**Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: AI technology enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language; applicable to counseling, assessment, and service delivery in social work contexts; exemplified by ChatGPT systems.

**Staub-Bernasconi's Action Theory**: Theoretical framework conceptualizing social work as a science of action grounded in professional values; serves as evaluative standard for assessing whether technological interventions maintain professional integrity and alignment with social work's fundamental mission.

**Modularization**: The fragmentation of holistic social work practice into discrete, algorithmic components; specifically the extraction of genuine social work activities (relational engagement, ethical judgment, contextual assessment) into automated processes, risking loss of professional integrity and relational dimensions.

**Media Equation Theory**: Framework explaining how humans attribute social qualities to technology and experience gratification through technological interaction; relevant for understanding client-AI interactions in social services and potential psychological effects.

**Human Rights Profession**: Conceptualization of social work as fundamentally oriented toward human rights protection, social justice, and client dignity; serves as evaluative standard for AI integration decisions.

**Genuine Social Work Activities**: Professional practices requiring human judgment, relational engagement, ethical discernment, and contextual understanding; distinguished from algorithmic or modularized functions.

## Significance

This article's significance lies in its contribution to critical, theoretically-informed discourse on AI in social professions during a period of rapid ChatGPT and NLP adoption. By grounding analysis in established social work theory (Staub-Bernasconi) rather than technological innovation alone, the authors model responsible scholarly engagement with emerging technologies. The work addresses a crucial gap: while AI adoption accelerates across social service sectors, rigorous professional analysis of implications remains limited. The forum format positions this as discussion-initiating scholarship, inviting further disciplinary engagement with specific practice domains. The article's balanced approach—acknowledging genuine opportunities while articulating serious professional risks regarding modularization and loss of relational practice—provides a template for responsible technology assessment in helping professions. Its timeliness (2023 publication) captures the critical moment when ChatGPT and similar systems entered social service discourse, making it essential for practitioners and scholars navigating AI integration decisions.
