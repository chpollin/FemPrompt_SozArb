# Summary: OECD 2023 Advancing

## Overview

The OECD Digital Economy Paper No. 349 (February 2023, reference: DSTI/CDEP/AIGO(2022)5/FINAL) presents a comprehensive framework for advancing accountability and trustworthiness in artificial intelligence systems through integrated risk management approaches spanning the entire AI lifecycle. Authored by Karine Perset and Luis Aranda under supervision of Audrey Plonk (Head, OECD Digital Economy Policy Division), this document addresses the critical implementation gap between abstract AI governance principles and institutional practice. The paper synthesizes work from approximately 200 experts across two specialized groups—Tools & Accountability (co-chaired by Nozha Boujemaa/IKEA, Andrea Renda/CEPS, Barry O'Brien/IBM) and Classification & Risk (co-chaired by Marko Grobelnik/JSI, Dewey Murdick/CSET, Sebastian Hallensleben/CEN-CENELEC)—convened between February 2020 and December 2022. Approved by the OECD Committee on Digital Economy Policy on 23 December 2022, it contributes to the AI-WIPS programme, supported by Germany's Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs (BMAS), addressing implications for work and productivity.

## Main Findings

The document establishes five critical findings regarding AI accountability and trustworthiness. First, **operationalization is essential**: the OECD AI Principles require concrete tools, processes, and mechanisms to function effectively in practice. Second, **risk-based differentiation enables proportionate governance**: the OECD's AI system classification framework allows tailored accountability strategies appropriate to specific applications and risk contexts. Third, **lifecycle accountability is fundamental**: governance must span design, development, deployment, and monitoring phases; accountability cannot be imposed at single points but requires continuous oversight. Fourth, **systemic integration is necessary**: effective accountability integrates technical safeguards, organizational structures, and governance mechanisms across multiple dimensions. Fifth, **multi-stakeholder coordination is essential**: successful implementation requires coordinated engagement among policymakers, industry, civil society (including CSISAC), and technical experts, reflecting diverse interests and expertise.

## Methodology/Approach

The document employs a **collaborative expert consensus methodology** prioritizing pragmatic policy development over traditional empirical research. The approach convened approximately 200 experts from government, industry (IBM, IKEA), civil society organizations (European Centre for Not-for-Profit Law, AI Transparency Institute), academic institutions (Jozef Stefan Institute), and international bodies (Inter-American Development Bank). Expert groups held regular virtual meetings reviewed by the OECD Working Party on Artificial Intelligence (AIGO) in May and November 2022, with additional review in April and September 2022. Rather than conducting independent empirical studies, the methodology built upon existing OECD frameworks—the OECD AI Principles, AI system lifecycle model, and AI system classification framework—as theoretical scaffolding. This approach prioritizes institutional legitimacy, stakeholder consensus, and policy applicability over novel empirical evidence, reflecting the document's normative, prescriptive orientation toward governance implementation.

## Relevant Concepts

**Trustworthy AI**: AI systems designed and governed to be reliable, transparent, and accountable throughout their lifecycle, integrating technical and governance dimensions.

**AI Lifecycle Accountability**: Continuous governance spanning design, development, deployment, and monitoring phases, recognizing accountability as systemic rather than point-based.

**Risk Management Framework**: Systematic approaches for identifying, assessing, and mitigating AI-related risks proportionate to system classification and operational context.

**AI System Classification**: Categorization of AI systems enabling differentiated governance strategies and proportionate accountability mechanisms based on risk profiles.

**OECD AI Principles**: Foundational governance principles requiring operationalization through concrete tools and institutional mechanisms.

**Tools & Accountability Framework**: Practical instruments translating abstract principles into implementable accountability mechanisms.

**Multi-Stakeholder Governance**: Coordinated engagement among government, industry, civil society, and technical experts in developing and implementing accountability mechanisms.

## Significance

This document holds substantial significance for AI governance discourse, policy development, and work-related AI implications. It provides institutional legitimacy and practical frameworks for OECD member states implementing AI accountability mechanisms, establishing governance standards influencing national and regional regulations. The work contributes to emerging AI governance literature by bridging the principle-to-practice gap, offering concrete guidance where academic literature remains theoretical. Its influence derives from OECD institutional authority, multi-stakeholder consensus, and connection to work productivity concerns rather than novel empirical findings, positioning it as a normative reference point for policymakers. The emphasis on lifecycle accountability, risk-based differentiation, and trustworthiness has influenced subsequent regulatory frameworks, including the EU AI Act. By integrating diverse stakeholder perspectives and addressing work-related implications through the AI-WIPS programme, the document reflects negotiated consensus among government, industry, and civil society, enhancing political acceptability while potentially limiting critical examination of underlying assumptions regarding governance effectiveness and implementation feasibility.
