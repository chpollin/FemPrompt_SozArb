# Summary: A Alliance 2024 Incubating

## Overview

The Feminist AI Research Network (f<a+i>r) represents a strategic initiative to operationalize feminist principles within artificial intelligence and automated decision-making systems across the Global South. Operating from 2021-2024 across three regional hubs (Latin America, Middle East-North Africa, and Southeast Asia) spanning 10 countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Philippines, Thailand), the network addresses a critical gap in AI development: the systematic exclusion of marginalized communities—particularly women, girls, and vulnerable populations—from both the design and governance of AI systems. Rather than limiting itself to critiquing existing AI harms, f<a+i>r advances a constructive agenda that positions feminist approaches as generative frameworks for creating equitable technological solutions. The initiative encompasses 18 research projects demonstrating that gender-just AI development is both theoretically coherent and practically implementable through deliberate methodological commitment.

## Main Findings

The initiative produced substantial evidence that feminist AI principles can be systematically operationalized through community-engaged research, organized across three implementation tiers. Nine standalone papers addressed gender-specific AI challenges including violence prevention, labor discrimination, language bias in service sectors, work-related disease annotation, and child marriage prevention. Four additional papers advanced prototype development, establishing frameworks for mainstreaming gender perspectives in crowdwork and developing feminist AI principles. Most significantly, five projects achieved full paper-prototype-pilot completion, including SafeHer Transit (women's safety in transportation), E.D.I.A. (bias detection in natural language processing), AymurAI (gender-based violence measurement), and SOF+IA (AI chatbot addressing digital harassment). Critically, f<a+i>r expanded the collective vision from a "floor" (preventing Gender-Based Violence harms) to a "ceiling" (creating new opportunities where women, girls, and marginalized communities become equal partners in decision-making and tool-making).

## Methodology/Approach

f<a+i>r employs a distinctive **paper → prototype → pilot** progression model that bridges academic research with applied implementation. This three-stage methodology ensures that theoretical insights translate into testable technologies and real-world deployment. The approach integrates design justice principles—emphasizing community participation and accountability—with multidisciplinary teams combining technologists and social scientists. Critically, community members function as co-creators rather than research subjects, ensuring that technology development reflects lived experiences of marginalized populations. The framework grounds all work in human rights-based approaches while maintaining regional contextualization across the Global South, recognizing that gender justice in AI requires culturally-specific solutions rather than universalized interventions.

## Relevant Concepts

**Feminist AI**: Artificial intelligence deliberately designed to deliver equality outcomes, with inclusion embedded at the core, creating opportunities for proactive correction of historical inequities.

**Design Justice**: A framework centering the voices and agency of marginalized communities in technological design processes, challenging extractive research models.

**Global South perspective**: Centering knowledge production and technological innovation from regions historically marginalized in AI development, challenging Global North-centric frameworks.

**Floor-to-ceiling vision**: Conceptual framework moving from preventing harm (floor: addressing Gender-Based Violence) to creating affirmative opportunities (ceiling: equal partnership in decision-making).

**Co-creation**: Collaborative development processes where affected communities participate as equal partners in knowledge production and tool design.

## Significance

This work fundamentally reframes feminist engagement with AI from reactive critique toward constructive innovation. By demonstrating that feminist principles generate superior technological outcomes for vulnerable populations, f<a+i>r challenges the false dichotomy between equity and functionality. The multi-regional approach across 10 countries directly contests Global North-centric AI discourse, establishing that gender justice is not peripheral but central to responsible AI development. The paper-prototype-pilot methodology provides a replicable model for institutionalizing feminist approaches within AI development. Recognition at ACM conferences indicates emerging legitimacy within mainstream computer science, though the work remains positioned at disciplinary margins. Most significantly, f<a+i>r demonstrates that feminist AI operationalization is achievable through systematic, community-engaged processes that address concrete social problems while maintaining equity principles, offering pathways for other regions and organizations to advance gender-just technological futures.
