    "abstractNote": "The rapid developments in AI technology and the rise of accessible AI-powered tools are transforming the way we live, work and learn. While young people have already warmly embraced these solutions, with Gen Z being the most active users and experimenters of Generative AI (Microsoft, 2024), there is a sense of confusion and fear among youth workers about the future of how AI tools are going to be used in the youth sector, mixed with diverse emotions and viewpoints ranging from apprehension, scepticism, resistance to feelings of enthusiasm and recognition of the significance of AI's role in the field (Pawluczuk, 2023).\n\nThis study aims to advance knowledge on the specific competencies required by youth workers to effectively integrate AI into their professional activities, as well as picture the current and potential use of AI for youth professionals.  \n\nThe publication is part of the Artificial Intelligence for Youth Work (AI4YouthWork)project, a pioneering initiative under the Erasmus+ programme, co-funded by the European Union, dedicated to enhancing the youth sector across Europe through the integration of artificial intelligence (AI). The project unites four organisations - Lascò from Italy, TEAM4Excellence from Romania, Kyttaro Enallaktikon Anazitiseon Neon from Greece, and Contextos from Portugal -, aspiring to contribute to increasing youth professionals' capacity to harness AI's potential to enhance the quality, attractiveness and effectiveness of their work, and prepare young people to thrive in AI-powered environments. \n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 1 introduces the project, highlighting the steps and methodological approaches to achieving the main objectives and the expected results.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 2, dedicated to the research methodology, outlines the approach and techniques used to conduct this study. It includes the research design, data collection methods through systematic review, focus groups and interviews, data analysis procedures, as well as limitations and criteria for ensuring the validity and reliability of the findings.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 3 presents the results of the desk research conducted by the consortium partners to explore the intersections of artificial intelligence, youth and youth work.  The chapter is divided into four main sections, addressing an introduction to AI, the impact of AI on youth, the role of youth workers in the AI revolution, and practical applications of AI in youth work settings.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 4 outlines the needs, challenges, and tasks involved in integrating AI into youth work, presenting the results of focus group discussions which have been conducted in each partner country.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 5 sets out the publication's conclusions, formulating recommendations for the development of an AI Competence Framework for Youth Workers, and enhancing the capacity of youth professionals to harness AI in their work.",

    "abstractNote": "Abstract\n            The successful irruption of AI-based technology in our daily lives has led to a growing educational, social, and political interest in training citizens in AI. Education systems now need to train students at the K-12 level to live in a society where they must interact with AI. Thus, AI literacy is a pedagogical and cognitive challenge at the K-12 level. This study aimed to understand how AI is being integrated into K-12 education worldwide. We conducted a search process following the systematic literature review method using Scopus. 179 documents were reviewed, and two broad groups of AI literacy approaches were identified, namely learning experience and theoretical perspective. The first group covered experiences in learning technical, conceptual and applied skills in a particular domain of interest. The second group revealed that significant efforts are being made to design models that frame AI literacy proposals. There were hardly any experiences that assessed whether students understood AI concepts after the learning experience. Little attention has been paid to the undesirable consequences of an indiscriminate and insufficiently thought-out application of AI. A competency framework is required to guide the didactic proposals designed by educational institutions and define a curriculum reflecting the sequence and academic continuity, which should be modular, personalized and adjusted to the conditions of the schools. Finally, AI literacy can be leveraged to enhance the learning of disciplinary core subjects by integrating AI into the teaching process of those subjects, provided the curriculum is co-designed with teachers.",

    "abstractNote": "L'intelligenza artificiale (IA) ha il potenziale per trasformare vari aspetti delle nostre vite, ma il suo sviluppo è stato accompagnato da numerose preoccupazioni sociali ed etiche. Per comprendere le implicazioni e i meccanismi sottostanti, è essenziale acquisire una comprensione ampia dei suoi benefici e svantaggi. A questo scopo, l'alfabetizzazione all'IA è un fattore fondamentale per promuovere atteggiamenti più consapevoli verso lo sviluppo dell'IA e delle sue implicazioni. Tuttavia, la ricerca sulla literacy all'IA è ancora agli esordi. Per contribuire ai progressi del settore, questo articolo presenta i risultati di uno studio volto a valutare l'alfabetizzazione all'IA degli studenti nel contesto dell'istruzione universitaria, concentrandosi su dei dottorandi. L’indagine sulla loro literacy all’IA è stata condotta su quattro dimensioni: cognitiva, operativa, critica ed etica. I risultati mostrano che, sebbene i partecipanti avessero poca conoscenza dell'IA, erano eccessivamente fiduciosi nelle capacità della tecnologia. Lo studio evidenzia la necessità di un approccio più completo all'alfabetizzazione all'IA, che includa una comprensione più profonda delle sue implicazioni etiche, sociali ed economiche.",

    "abstractNote": "This study aims to develop a comprehensive competency framework for artificial intelligence (AI) literacy, delineating essential competencies and sub‐competencies. This framework and its potential variations, tailored to different learner groups (by educational level and discipline), can serve as a crucial reference for designing and implementing AI curricula. However, the research on AI literacy by target learners is still in its infancy, and the findings of several existing studies provide inconsistent guidelines for educational practices. Following the 2020 PRISMA guidelines, we searched the Web of Science, Scopus, and ScienceDirect databases to identify relevant studies published between January 2012 and October 2024. The quality of the included studies was evaluated using QualSyst. A total of 29 studies were identified, and their research findings were synthesized. Results show that at the K‐12 level, the required competencies include basic AI knowledge, device usage, and AI ethics. For higher education, the focus shifts to understanding data and algorithms, problem‐solving, and career‐related competencies. For general workforce, emphasis is placed on the interpretation and utilization of data and AI tools for specific careers, along with error detection and AI‐based decision‐making. This study connects the progression of specific learning objectives, which should be intensively addressed at each stage, to propose an AI literacy education pathway. We discuss the findings, potentials, and limitations of the derived competency framework for AI literacy, including its theoretical and practical implications and future research suggestions.\n            \n            \n              \n              \n                \n                  \n                    Practitioner notes\n                  \n                  \n                    What is already known about this topic\n                    \n                      \n                        AI literacy is becoming increasingly important as AI technologies are integrated into various aspects of life and work.\n                      \n                      \n                        Research on AI literacy competencies across diverse learner groups and disciplines remains fragmented and inconsistent to guide educational practices.\n                      \n                      \n                        Studies providing a coherent pathway for AI literacy development throughout educational and working life are lacking.\n                      \n                    \n                  \n                  \n                    What this paper adds\n                    \n                      \n                        A comprehensive AI literacy competency framework consisting of 8 competencies and 18 sub‐competencies.\n                      \n                      \n                        Variations in AI literacy competencies with tailored configuration and prioritization across different learner groups by school levels and disciplines.\n                      \n                      \n                        A proposed pathway for developing AI literacy from K‐12 to higher education and workforce levels.\n                      \n                    \n                  \n                  \n                    Implications for practice and policy\n                    \n                      \n                        The framework can guide the design and implementation of AI curricula tailored to different learner characteristics and needs.\n                      \n                      \n                        Education should shift focus from teaching how to use AI to fostering competencies for critical, strategic, responsible and ethical integration of AI.\n                      \n                      \n                        Policies are needed to support a systematic pathway for lifelong AI literacy development from K‐12 education to workforce training.",

This scoping review was conducted following the methodological framework of Arksey and O’Malley.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              A total of 268 articles were identified (263 from the initial search and 5 more added from the references of the original papers), 53 of which were finally selected for full text analysis. Digital health literacy is the most frequently used descriptor to refer to the ability to find and use health information with the goal of addressing or solving a health problem using technology. The most utilized tool to assess digital health literacy is the eHealth literacy scale (eHEALS), a self-reported measurement tool that evaluates six core dimensions and is available in various languages. Individuals with higher digital health literacy scores have better self-management and participation in their own medical decisions, mental and psychological state and quality of life. Effective interventions addressing poor digital health literacy included education/training and social support.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              Although there is interest in the study and impact of poor digital health literacy, there is still a long way to go to improve measurement tools and find effective interventions to reduce the digital health divide.",

To serve this purpose, the databases of WoS/Clarivate Analytics, Proquest Central, Emerald Management Journals, Jstor Business College Collections and Scopus/Elsevier were searched with four keyword-combinations and final forty-three articles were included in the dataset. The researchers applied a systematic literature review method to the dataset. The preliminary findings demonstrated that there is a growing prevalence of digital literacy articles starting from the year 2013. The dominant research methodology of the reviewed articles is qualitative. The four major themes revealed from the qualitative content analysis are: digital literacy, digital competencies, digital skills and digital thinking. Under each theme, the categories and their frequencies are analysed. Recommendations for further research and for real life implementations are generated.",

This study aims to present a literature review of students’ digital literacy. Grounded on about twenty journal articles and other related publications from the Web of Science Core Collection, this paper focused on the definition of digital literacy; the factors affecting students’ digital literacy (age, gender, family socioeconomic status, and parent’s education level); the relationship between students’ digital literacy and their self-control, technostress, and engagement; and the three approaches to gauge the level of students’ digital literacy. The study also provided some advice for educators and policymakers. Finally, the limitations and implications were presented.",

A comprehensive review of literature was conducted to examine existing research on the intersection of AI and social work. Drawing on insights from this review, an EPIC model for integrating artificial intelligence into the profession is presented, consisting of four components: (E) ethics and justice; (P) policy development and advocacy; (I) intersectoral collaboration; and (C) community engagement and empowerment. The author contends that augmenting the benefits of artificial intelligence in social work requires a proactive and ethical approach towards a more secure, safe, transparent, and socially just future.",

    "abstractNote": "Die rasante Entwicklung generativer Künstlicher Intelligenz (KI) macht Prompt Engineering zu einer Schlüsselkompetenz für den kompetenten Umgang mit KI-Modellen. Während zahlreiche Prompting-Techniken und -Frameworks existieren, fehlt bislang eine systematische Integration in den schulischen Kontext. Diese Publikation stellt das PCRR-Framework (Plan – Create – Review – Reflect) vor, das als ganzheitlicher Ansatz für den Einsatz von Prompt Engineering im Unterricht dient. Basierend auf Erfahrungen aus dem Hochschullehrgang „Künstliche Intelligenz im IT-Unterricht der Berufsbildung“ (PH Tirol und Hochschule für Agrar- und Umweltpädagogik) wurde das Framework iterativ weiterentwickelt und in drei Praxisbeispielen erprobt. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass das PCRR-Framework die Effizienz und Qualität der Prompterstellung steigern kann und die Schüler:innen beim Umgang mit Sprachmodellen (Large Language Models, LLMs) unterstützt. Gleichzeitig wurden Herausforderungen deutlich, insbesondere hinsichtlich der methodischen Vergleichbarkeit der Ergebnisse sowie der Akzeptanz bestimmter Prompting-Techniken. Das Paper diskutiert diese Erkenntnisse, methodischen Limitationen und Verbesserungspotenziale und bietet einen Ausblick auf zukünftige Forschungsarbeiten. Neben der Weiterentwicklung des PCRR-Frameworks wird die Notwendigkeit betont, AI Literacy systematisch in Lehrpläne und Lehramtsausbildungen zu integrieren, um eine nachhaltige und verantwortungsbewusste Nutzung von KI im Bildungsbereich zu ermöglichen.",

    "abstractNote": "Die Bedeutung des Einsatzes von Verfahren, die unter dem Begriff der Künstlichen Intelligenz (KI) zusammenzufassen sind, wird sowohl für gesellschaftliche Prozesse als auch den Auftrag an die Soziale Arbeit zunehmend erkannt und diskutiert. Mit diesem Artikel wird ein Beitrag zum Diskurs geleistet, indem vertieft der Bereich der Sprachverarbeitung durch KI, das Natural Language Processing (NLP), in den Blick genommen wird. Verarbeitung natürlicher Sprache ist aufgrund der hohen Bedeutung kommunikativer Prozesse für die Praxis der Sozialen Arbeit von besonderer Relevanz, zugleich wird die Profession der Sozialen Arbeit tangiert. Bezugnehmend auf Staub-Bernasconis Handlungstheorie werden Implikationen und Diskussionspunkte von NLP identifiziert und diskutiert. Zudem werden mögliche Gratifikationen für Klient*innen herausgearbeitet, die sich u. a. aus der Wirkung und sozialen Interaktion ergeben. Hier wird die Media-Equation-Theorie von Nass und Reeves als Erkenntnisfolie herangezogen. Vor diesen Perspektiven ergeben sich sowohl Risiken (u. a. die Gefahr einer modularisierten Herauslösung genuin sozialarbeiterischer Tätigkeit) als auch Chancen (u. a. Teilhabe, niederschwelliger Zugang, Zugriff auf breitere Datenbasis).",

    "abstractNote": "Der Artikel untersucht die Akzeptanz und organisationalen Rahmenbedingungen digitaler Technologien, insbesondere Künstlicher Intelligenz (KI), in der Praxis der Sozialen Arbeit aus Sicht der Fachkräfte. Während digitale Technologien im administrativen Bereich bereits weit verbreitet sind, zeigt sich bei der Nutzung digitaler Technologien in der direkten Arbeit mit den Klient:innen noch Zurückhaltung. Durch die Entwicklungen im Bereich KI ergeben sich zunehmend neue Möglichkeiten digitale Technologien auch im Bereich der Interaktionsarbeit mit den Klient:innen zu nutzen. Zugleich stellt dies die Fachkräfte vor ethische und professionelle Herausforderungen. Die empirische Untersuchung unter Berufseinsteiger:innen zeigt, dass der Einsatz von KI im beruflichen Kontext kritisch bewertet wird. Bedenken bestehen insbesondere in Bezug auf Datenschutz und die Unersetzbarkeit menschlicher Empathie durch die KI. Die Akzeptanz von KI und digitalen Technologien hängt von den digitalen Kompetenzen und den Erfahrungen der Fachkräfte beim Einsatz digitaler Technologien im beruflichen Kontext ab, die in diesem Bereich noch ausbaufähig sind. Vor dem Hintergrund einer zunehmend digitalisierten Gesellschaft fordert der Artikel eine kritische Auseinandersetzung mit den technischen Entwicklungen und betont die Notwendigkeit von Fort- und Weiterbildungen sowie einer partizipativen Technikgestaltung, um die Praxis der Sozialen Arbeit nachhaltig zu gestalten.",

To achieve this, learners need to be equipped with AI knowledge and concepts and develop AI literacy. Paradoxically, it is largely unclear what AI literacy is and how we should learn and teach it. We address both of these questions through a systematic review of systematic reviews, also known as an umbrella review, to gain a comprehensive understanding of AI literacy. After searching the literature, we critically examine the results of 17 reviews focusing on AI literacy and the teaching and learning of AI concepts. Our analysis revealed several encouraging developments: a general consensus on the definition of AI literacy, the availability of teaching tools and materials that support AI learning without prior programming experience, and effective pedagogical approaches that have shown positive effects on students' understanding and engagement. In addition, we identified several areas needing attention in the field: an interdisciplinary pedagogical approach, integration of ethical considerations in AI education, discussions on AI policy, and standardized, content-validated, reliable assessments across educational levels and cultures.",

It highlights the systemic weaknesses of foundation models, the dangers they pose to vulnerable groups, and the possible alternatives.\n\nThis report illustrates why it is critical to scrutinize foundation models. It thus offers a starting point and impetus for decision-makers and practitioners in mission-driven organizations, as well as anyone committed to a responsible digital future.

By synthesising research from 2010 to 2024, the study examines how gender bias manifests in AI, its impact on women’s participation in technology, and the effectiveness of digital literacy initiatives in addressing these disparities.\n\nMethods\n\nA systematic literature search was conducted across major academic databases, including Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, and Google Scholar. The review focused on peer-reviewed articles, reports, and case studies published between 2010 and 2024 that addressed gender bias in AI, women’s participation in technology, and digital literacy initiatives. A thematic analysis framework was employed to identify and synthesise recurring themes and patterns.\n\nResults\n\nThe findings reveal systemic gender biases embedded in AI applications across diverse domains, such as recruitment, healthcare, and financial services. These biases stem from factors including the under-representation of women in AI development teams, biased training datasets, and algorithmic design choices. Digital literacy programs emerge as a promising intervention, fostering a critical awareness of AI bias, encouraging women to pursue AI careers, and catalysing growth in women-led AI projects.\n\nConclusions Although gender bias in AI poses significant challenges, this review highlights digital literacy as a transformative tool for achieving gender equity in AI development and application. The study highlights the importance of inclusive AI design, gender-responsive education policies, and sustained research efforts to mitigate bias and promote equity.",

However, it’s remarkably difficult to get reproducible results out of large language models.\nFor example, you might observe that asking ChatGPT the same question multiple times provides different results. This by itself is not surprising, since getting a result from a language model involves “sampling”, a process that converts the language model’s output into a probability distribution and probabilistically selects a token.\nWhat might be more surprising is that even when we adjust the temperature down to 0This means that the LLM always chooses the highest probability token, which is called greedy sampling. (thus making the sampling theoretically deterministic), LLM APIs are still not deterministic in practice (see past discussions here, here, or here). Even when running inference on your own hardware with an OSS inference library like vLLM or SGLang, sampling still isn’t deterministic (see here or here).",

CoT prompting, which forced the model to explicitly label each word's gender before counting, significantly reduced these mistakes. This suggests that guiding the model through an explicit reasoning process makes it rely more on logic than on stereotypes, thereby mitigating bias.",

Multi-step pipelines were most effective, reducing biased content by up to ~88%, while simpler methods like cultural prompts showed ~71–81% improvement. The review concludes that while prompt engineering can mitigate biases without retraining, deep-seated biases may persist, and fixes can be superficial.",

All four strategies eliminated cultural stereotypes in GPT-3.5's outputs. For GPT-4, bias mitigation was more nuanced, requiring task-specific prompts. This indicates that while various prompts can reduce stereotypes, newer models may need more targeted strategies.",

    "abstractNote": "This extensive report – developed through the Global Partnership on AI (GPAI) with contributors from academia and policy – sets out a vision for “substantive equality” in AI as opposed to mere formal equality. It recognizes that AI systems can replicate and even amplify societal power imbalances (“algorithmic discrimination”), thus requiring proactive governance to ensure historically marginalized groups are not left behind in the AI era. The report argues that purely technical bias mitigation is insufficient; instead, transformative policies should intervene at multiple points in the AI lifecycle to address structural inequities. Key principles advocated include: anchoring AI development in human rights and intersectional gender analysis, improving inclusive representation in data and AI design, and imposing stronger transparency and accountability obligations on AI systems to prevent harm. It provides practical policy recommendations (e.g., mandating diverse datasets and impact assessments, establishing a “right to information” about AI algorithms, and supporting community-led AI initiatives) to achieve de facto equality of outcomes – meaning AI should actively help reduce societal inequalities rather than reinforce them. Overall, the report positions digital equity as an extension of social justice: ensuring not only fairness within AI outputs but also equitable access, participation, and empowerment in shaping AI technology.",

    "abstractNote": "Kattnig et al. examine the disconnect between existing AI fairness techniques and the requirements of non-discrimination law, highlighting that many algorithmic bias mitigation methods do not meet legal standards for equality. Focusing on the EU context (with particular attention to the forthcoming AI Act and established non-discrimination directives), the authors review state-of-the-art bias mitigation approaches – from pre-processing data fixes to in-processing algorithms – and evaluate them against legal concepts of fairness and equality. They discuss how ambiguous legal frameworks and the difficulty of defining “fairness” pose challenges: for instance, fairness has multiple interpretations (individual vs. group fairness, formal vs. substantive equality) and is understood differently across disciplines. The paper argues for an interdisciplinary legal methodology to complement technical solutions. In practice, this means moving beyond purely quantitative parity metrics and ensuring AI systems comply with human rights and equality principles (e.g. ensuring de facto non-discrimination for all data subjects). By contrasting algorithms with legal norms, the study underlines that trustworthy AI requires more than technical robustness – it demands alignment with justice and accountability frameworks.",

Alvarez et al. survey the state-of-the-art in fair AI techniques and review major policy initiatives and standards on algorithmic bias. A key contribution is the NoBIAS architecture introduced in the paper, which comprises a “Legal Layer” (focusing on EU non-discrimination law and human rights requirements) and a “Bias Management Layer” (covering bias understanding, mitigation, and accountability). The authors note that AI systems have produced real-world harms, including illegal discrimination against protected groups, and they highlight challenges such as intersectional discrimination that current EU law does not explicitly address. By organizing existing knowledge and best practices, the article guides researchers and practitioners in aligning technical solutions with ethical and legal norms – underscoring that managing AI bias requires not just algorithmic techniques but also adherence to equality principles and governance frameworks.",

    "abstractNote": "In this working paper, McCrory argues that prevailing global AI governance efforts (especially those focused on “AI safety” and existential risks) lack an adequate intersectional, feminist perspective, which is needed to avert not just hypothetical future catastrophes but ongoing injustices. The paper analyzes seven prominent international AI policy initiatives (e.g. global AI accords and principles) against criteria derived from feminist theory, such as intersectionality, context, and power dynamics. McCrory finds that these high-level policies often remain techno-centric: they invoke abstract risks or neutrality, but fail to engage with how AI harms are unevenly distributed along lines of gender, race, and class. For example, current AI “safety” pledges seldom consider the lived experiences of marginalized communities or the way existing structural inequalities are mirrored in AI systems. The author contends that treating AI governance as a purely technical, top-down process is misguided; instead, governance should include meaningful participation from under-represented groups and incorporate feminist insights about power and oppression. The paper’s recommendations call for centering intersectionality in AI policy: explicitly addressing how AI-related risks and harms intersect with social identity and historical injustices, and ensuring that any frameworks for AI risk management or ethics actively involve those who have been marginalized by past technological developments.",

    "abstractNote": "Ulnicane’s article investigates how intersectionality – the overlapping of gender, race, class and other social inequalities – is being addressed in debates about AI bias. Through an analysis of four high-profile reports on AI and discrimination, the study finds that AI is often incorrectly portrayed as neutral, whereas in reality it amplifies existing societal biases, leading to discriminatory outcomes. A core issue identified is the tech sector’s “diversity crisis”: a homogenous AI workforce (primarily white, male developers) embeds its biases into AI systems, creating a feedback loop of inequality. The reviewed reports frame this situation as urgent – noting that past superficial diversity initiatives have failed – and call for holistic, structural solutions. Rather than just adding token diversity, they emphasize changing organizational culture and power dynamics in AI development, and giving marginalized groups more influence in shaping AI. Ulnicane highlights a concern that discussions of intersectional fairness risk being siloed as special-interest issues “for women and minorities” instead of being treated as core to AI innovation. The article concludes with recommendations: centering intersectionality and equity in AI policy, ensuring that efforts to fix AI bias focus on underlying power structures and systemic change, not merely on technical tweaks or increased headcounts.",

The AI Act’s pre-market and post-market measures are analyzed to reveal how they often reinforce, rather than challenge, algorithmic discrimination. The author concludes that effective AI governance must go beyond technical fixes, incorporating an intersectional perspective and substantive equality principles. She calls for feminist-informed revisions to the AI Act – emphasizing gender inclusivity, intersectionality, and accountability – to ensure AI regulation actively dismantles (instead of inadvertently upholding) existing power asymmetries.",

    "abstractNote": "In this summary of her foundational work, Ruha Benjamin introduces the concept of the \"New Jim Code,\" which describes how new technologies, including AI, can reproduce and even deepen existing racial hierarchies and discrimination under a veneer of neutrality and progress. She argues that discrimination becomes embedded in the very architecture of these systems. This framework is crucial for understanding how various forms of discrimination are co-constituted in AI, not as accidental bugs, but as features of a system designed within a society that has not resolved its structural inequalities. The concept inherently critiques individual competence, showing how even well-intentioned developers can create discriminatory systems if the underlying societal \"default settings\" are not challenged.",

They highlight the severe underrepresentation of women in AI development as a key source of bias, leading to the creation of systems that reflect and amplify a masculine worldview. The authors contend that simply adding more women to the field is insufficient. Instead, they call for a fundamental shift in the culture of technology production, challenging the technical-social dualism and integrating feminist perspectives into the very design of AI. This requires addressing the structural power asymmetries that shape technological development and moving beyond individualistic solutions.",

They critique audits that focus solely on technical metrics, advocating instead for methods that center the lived experiences of marginalized communities.

Such an audit practice inherently makes the co-constitution of discrimination visible by investigating not just the algorithm's output, but the entire socio-technical system in which it is embedded.

The study shows that researchers predominantly reduce intersectionality to optimizing fairness metrics across demographic subgroups while neglecting social context and power structures. The authors develop a framework for re-conceptualizing intersectionality in AI fairness based on relationality, social power, and structural analysis. They argue that genuine intersectional approaches must consider the interweaving of various systems of oppression rather than treating them as separate, additive categories.",

Feminist ethical framework emphasizes transparency, fairness, and inclusivity while questioning patriarchal and corporate-driven narratives in AI research and policy. Analysis shows AI ethics must go beyond technical solutions to address systemic power imbalances and cultural biases in data.",

Across multiple studies, the brief reveals how\nbiases emerge in the text generated by LLMs, through gendered word associations, positive or\nnegative regard for gendered subjects, or diversity in text generated by gender and culture.\nThe research uncovers persistent social biases within these state-of-the-art language models,\ndespite ongoing efforts to mitigate such issues. The findings underscore the critical need for\ncontinuous research and policy intervention to address the biases that exacerbate as these\ntechnologies are integrated across diverse societal and cultural landscapes. The emphasis on\nGPT-2 and Llama 2 being open-source foundational models is particularly noteworthy, as their\nwidespread adoption underlines the urgent need for scalable, objective methods to assess and\ncorrect biases, ensuring fairness in AI systems globally.",

Es zielt darauf ab, ein Bewusstsein für intersektionale Diskriminierung in KI-Systemen zu schaffen und konkrete Handlungsstrategien zur Risikominderung anzubieten. Das Toolkit betont die Notwendigkeit, über einzelne Diskriminierungsachsen (wie Geschlecht oder Herkunft) hinauszudenken und deren Verschränkungen zu analysieren. Es fördert eine KI-Kompetenz, die es Stakeholdern ermöglicht, KI-Systeme über ihren gesamten Lebenszyklus hinweg – von der Datensammlung über das Design bis zur Anwendung – auf intersektionale Risiken zu prüfen. Für das Prompting bedeutet dies, gezielt Szenarien zu entwerfen, die marginalisierte Identitäten an der Schnittstelle mehrerer Merkmale repräsentieren, um blinde Flecken und stereotype Assoziationen in KI-Modellen aufzudecken.",

Die Forschung zeigt, wie diese Dokumente Probleme rahmen und Empfehlungen zur Adressierung von Ungleichheiten formulieren. AI-Systeme verstärken und verschärfen oft menschliche Verzerrungen und Stereotypen, was zu Diskriminierung und Marginalisierung führt. Die Analyse deckt systematische Probleme auf: Diversitätskrisen in AI-Entwicklung, wo Gründer und Mitarbeiter hauptsächlich aus homogenen Gruppen weißer Männer stammen, sowie die Verstärkung bestehender Machtbeziehungen durch AI-Systeme. Die Studie betont die Notwendigkeit intersektionaler Ansätze, die multiple Ungleichheiten berücksichtigen, die aus der Interaktion verschiedener sozialer Identitäten entstehen. Empfehlungen umfassen partizipative AI-Design-Prinzipien und die Einbindung diverser Stakeholder in AI-Governance-Prozesse.",
