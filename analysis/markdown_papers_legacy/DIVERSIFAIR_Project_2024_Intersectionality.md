## WHY THIS KIT?

In  recent years, bias in artificial intelligence (AI) has become a major concern, affecting public trust, social harmony, and fair governance. As AI systems play a bigger role in public services and policy decisions, their hidden biases can make existing inequalities worse. One significant issue is intersectional bias, where different forms of discrimination-such as racism, sexism, ableism, and colonialism-overlap and affect people in complex ways.

This type of bias is especially harmful to people who already face multiple disadvantages. It can be seen in AI systems that unintentionally repeat these inequalities. For example, in the 2021 Dutch  childcare  benefits  scandal,  an  algorithm  wrongly  accused  immigrant  parents  of  fraud, leading to unfair debt recovery, family separations, and other harms. This highlights the need for policymakers to tackle intersectional issues in AI systems.

This toolkit, created through the DIVERSIFAIR Erasmus+  project,  is  based on  thorough  research  and  stakeholder engagement across the EU.

It  aims  to  provide  policymakers  with  the knowledge and tools to include intersectionality in AI policies. By focusing on  fairness  and  inclusivity,  policymakers can create AI systems that promote equality rather than worsen current inequalities.

## 01. UNDERSTANDING INTERSECTIONAL BIAS IN AI

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is changing many parts of our lives, from healthcare and education to media and law enforcement. While AI has the potential to improve our world, it often reflects and reinforces biases that exist in its design and the data it uses. For civil society organisations, educators,  and  the  general  public,  understanding  these  biases-especially  through  the  lens  of intersectionality-is key to creating fair and inclusive technology.

If left unchecked, these biases can worsen existing inequalities and cause harm, particularly for already marginalised groups. The Council of Europe's Gender Equality Strategy (2024-2029) calls for tackling structural barriers and encouraging diversity in AI development. Policies like the EU AI  Act  are  steps  in  the  right  direction,  but  for  these  efforts  to  truly  succeed,  they  must  fully consider how different forms of discrimination intersect.

But what exactly is intersectional bias in AI? Are concepts like "intersectionality" merely trendy terms, or do they carry genuine importance? This section will break down these ideas, offering a clear explanation of what they mean and why they matter.

<!-- image -->

AI is not just a neutral tool but is co-created with society, and as such has major political and social implications in reinforcing existing power relationships, discrimination, and structural inequalities.

- Inga Ulnicane, "Intersectionality in Artificial Intelligence: Framing Concerns and Recommendations for Action," April 2024

## 1.1 KEY CONCEPTS DEFINED

<!-- image -->

## ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)

AI  refers  to  systems  designed  to  replicate  human  cognitive  processes  such  as  learning, problem-solving, and decision-making.

It powers applications ranging from voice assistants (like Siri, Alexa or Google Assistant) to more complex tools like recommendation systems, autonomous vehicles, predictive policing algorithms.

As a human-made technology, AI is shaped by the decisions, values, and biases of its creators, making it crucial to ensure ethical design and diverse, high-quality data inputs. AI systems learn from data, and the quality of this data heavily influences their outputs. If biased data is used, biased outcomes are likely.

<!-- image -->

Simply put, artificial intelligence (AI) involves using computers to classify, analyse, and draw predictions from data sets, using a set of rules called algorithms. AI algorithms are trained using large datasets so that they can identify patterns, make predictions, recommend actions, and figure out what to do in unfamiliar situations, learning from new data and thus improving over time. The ability of an AI system to improve automatically through experience is known as Machine Learning (ML).'

-'Artificial Intelligence and Gender Equality', UNESCO, 2020

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Bias in AI is a systematic distortion that produces unfair outcomes for specific groups. It can for example result from flawed data (e.g., historical discrimination) or use of algorithms that fail to account for diversity.

Bias can emerge at any point in the machine learning (ML) lifecycle, which involves a series of decisions and practices shaping the design and use of ML systems.

Why  Does  It  Matter? Bias  in  AI  can  lead  to  flawed  insights  and  missed  opportunities.  For example,  biased  hiring  algorithms  may  exclude  qualified  candidates,  reducing  workforce diversity and innovation. Businesses that actively identify and mitigate bias position themselves as ethical leaders, enhancing trust among stakeholders.

## FAIRNESS

Fairness in AI refers to designing systems that promote equitable outcomes for all individuals , regardless of identity. While achieving perfect fairness is challenging, developers  and stakeholders aim to minimise harm by identifying and addressing biases.

Many approaches to AI fairness focus on addressing just one type of bias at a time, such as gender or race. However, this approach ignores the complex ways biases overlap and affect people with multiple marginalised identities (intersectional groups).

<!-- image -->

## INTERSECTIONALITY

Intersectionality, a term coined by legal scholar Kimberlé Crenshaw, is an approach to describe and  address  complex  and  nuanced  forms  of  discrimination  that  result  from  interconnecting forms of oppression (e.g. racism, (cis)sexism, ableism, colonialism), a nd the unique harm people experience based on their multiple intersecting identities .  For  example,  a  Black  woman  may face  combined  challenges  of  racism  and  sexism,  distinct  from  those  faced  by  Black  men  or White women.

Employees who face discrimination linked to intersectionality have higher turnover rates, which results in an expense that cannot be salvaged.

## INTERSECTIONAL BIAS IN AI

<!-- image -->

'Intersectional  bias  in  AI' describes  the  AI  harms  as  experienced  by  people  due  to  multiple intersecting and often marginalised parts of their identity.

## 1.2 HOW DOES INTERSECTIONAL BIAS IN AI MANIFEST?

Intersectional bias in AI has real-world consequences, particularly for marginalised communities. These biases can affect people's lives in many ways, from discriminatory policing practices to unequal access to healthcare and harmful portrayals in the media.

The  following  examples  illustrate  how  intersectional  bias  can  manifest  in  different  areas, highlighting the importance of inclusive and ethical AI practices.

## PREDICTIVE POLICING 1

Predictive policing systems, often trained on historical arrest data, disproportionately target low-income communities of colour.

## THIS EXAMPLE CAN BE USED TO ADVOCATE FOR

- Inclusive data practices
- Ensure equal access
- Address structural inequities

## 2 HEALTHCARE DISPARITIES

AI algorithms used in healthcare tend to prioritise patients based on insurance data. Marginalised communities,  who  are  often  uninsured  or  underinsured,  tend  to  receive  less  care  due  to  their exclusion from training data.

## THIS EXAMPLE CAN BE USED TO ADVOCATE FOR

- Regulating AI in criminal justice
- Mandating human oversight
- Data audits

## 3 DISCRIMINATORY AD TARGETING

Algorithmic bias in advertising can have harmful effects. For example, research shows that women are often underrepresented in ads for high-paying jobs, and racial minorities are disproportionately targeted by ads for predatory loans or housing

## THIS EXAMPLE CAN BE USED TO ADVOCATE FOR

- Promoting diversity in algorithms
- Mandating transparency
- Encouraging ethical practices

## BUILD TRUST, DRIVE GROWTH

Industry professionals and leaders have a critical role in shaping the future of  ethical  AI.  By  addressing  intersectional  bias,  businesses  can  enhance trust, innovation, and inclusivity while ensuring regulatory compliance. The benefits go beyond risk mitigation-ethical AI systems unlock new markets, foster customer  loyalty, and attract diverse talent, driving  long-term business growth.

Now  is  the  time  to  act. Businesses  should  prioritise  diversity in  AI development teams, establish regular bias audits, and embed fairness as a core principle in their AI strategy. By taking these steps, your organisation can lead the way in building inclusive technologies that resonate with global audiences.

## LEAD WITH INCLUSIVE AI

Your  company  deploys  an  AI-driven  hiring  tool  to  screen  candidates.  After  a  year,  you notice fewer women and minority candidates being hired compared to previous methods.

- How could this affect your company's reputation and compliance with diversity goals?
- What steps can your team take to ensure your AI systems reflect your company's commitment to inclusivity and ethical practices?

<!-- image -->

## 02. THE BUSINESS CASE FOR FAIR AI

Fair  and inclusive AI is not just an ethical imperative-it is a strategic advantage that benefits businesses  in  multiple  ways.  Addressing  bias  and  fostering  inclusivity  in  AI  systems  enable businesses to unlock new opportunities, align with corporate social responsibility (CSR) goals, and build stronger relationships with consumers. This section highlights the tangible benefits of fair AI and actionable insights for leveraging its potential.

<!-- image -->

## TAPPING INTO NEW MARKETS

Ignoring bias in AI systems can result in substantial missed opportunities, restricting access to diverse talent  and  untapped  markets.  By  failing  to  address  the  needs  of  marginalised communities,  companies  limit  innovation  and  growth  potential.  Inclusive  AI,  designed  with diverse  voices  and  perspectives,  not  only  drives  fairness  but  also  resonates  with  broader audiences, fostering market expansion and brand loyalty.

## Expanding Market Reach through Inclusive Product Design

Apple initially overlooked menstrual tracking in its Health app, sparking backlash for failing to meet  the  needs  of  half  its  user  base.  Inclusive  updates  to  address  such  oversights  not  only enhance functionality but also broaden product appeal to diverse customer segments.

## EMBEDDING FAIR AI FOR SUSTAINABLE SUCCESS

Adopting fair AI practices strengthens corporate social responsibility efforts and demonstrates a company's commitment to societal well-being. In a landscape where consumers and investors increasingly value ethical practices, addressing bias and inclusivity  becomes  a  business imperative. Companies that prioritise fairness in AI signal responsibility and innovation, securing competitive advantages. Conversely, those that neglect these practices risk reputational harm, loss of trust, and diminished profitability.

## Ethical AI as CSR Strategy

Companies that fail to integrate fairness into AI risk accusations of 'bias washing' or superficial ethics claims. By genuinely addressing bias, businesses can build trust with stakeholders.

## 03. STRATEGIC APPROACHES TO REDUCING INTERSECTIONAL BIAS IN AI

Mitigating  intersectional  bias  in  AI  requires  a  collaborative  effort  that  goes  beyond  technical solutions to embrace intentional strategies, diverse perspectives, and accountability. Bias can arise  at  any  stage-whether  in  the  datasets  that  train  AI,  the  design  of  algorithms,  or  the deployment and usage decisions-making it essential to address it holistically.

This section draws on insights from research and recommendations from industry stakeholders, including participants from the DIVERSIFAIR expert interviews and focus groups.

## AMAZON'S AI RECRUITING TOOL: GENDER BIAS IN HIRING

## Overview

In  2018,  Amazon  scrapped  an  AI-powered  recruiting  tool  after  discovering  that  it  was  biased against women. The tool, designed to help automate the hiring process, was trained on resumes submitted  to  Amazon  over  a  10-year  period.  However,  it  developed  a  bias  that  favored  male candidates for technical roles, as the majority of applicants in these fields were men. The AI system penalised  resumes  that  included  terms  associated  with  female-oriented  positions  or  activities, further perpetuating gender imbalances in hiring practices.

## Intersectionality at play

cc The  bias  in  the  AI  system  was  primarily  gendered,  but  its  impact  was  compounded  by  the intersection  of  gender  with  other  factors  such  as  occupation  and  industry  norms.  The  tool's preference for male candidates was driven by historical data that reflected the underrepresentation  of  women  in  technical  roles  at  Amazon.  Women  were  penalised  by  the system, not only for their gender but also for the types of roles they were applying for, reinforcing traditional gender stereotypes about which jobs are 'appropriate' for women.  This  bias disproportionately  affected  women,  especially  those  trying  to  break  into  male-dominated  fields like engineering and technology. The system also inadvertently overlooked women with caregiving or family responsibilities who might have had resumes that did not fit traditional, male-oriented career trajectories.

## Why intersectionality matters

Intersectionality  is  essential  to  understanding  how  this  biased  AI  system  disproportionately affected women, especially in the context of technical fields. The bias was not just a result of being a woman, but also of societal norms and expectations about which careers are suitable for women. This  intersection  of  gender  and  industry-specific  factors  (e.g.,  male-dominated  tech  sectors) created additional barriers for women seeking equal opportunities in the workforce. Recognising the role of intersectionality in AI bias helps to highlight that the problem was not just about gender alone  but  about  how  gender  intersects  with  historically  male-dominated  industries,  creating compounded disadvantages for women.

## CHILD CARE BENEFIT SCANDAL IN THE NETHERLANDS : SYSTEMIC DISCRIMINATION

## Overview

In the Netherlands, an AI system was used by the government to detect fraudulent claims for child care benefits. However, the system disproportionately flagged minority families, particularly those with immigrant backgrounds, as fraudulent. This led to devastating financial and social consequences, including the wrongful accusation of fraud.

## Intersectionality at play

The system's reliance on biased data-such as income levels, family structure, and national origindiscriminated  against  families  at  the  intersection  of  race  and  socio-economic  status.  Immigrant families, who may have different social and economic profiles, were unfairly targeted, while native Dutch families were less likely to be flagged. The biases embedded in the algorithm reflect broader patterns of systemic racism and classism within Dutch society, exacerbating the harm to already marginalised groups.

## Why intersectionality matters

Intersectionality  helps  us  understand  how  AI  systems,  by  relying  on  historical  data  that  reflects societal prejudices, can amplify these biases. In this case, the intersection of race and class made certain  families  more  vulnerable  to  the  risk  of  being  falsely  accused,  highlighting  the  need  for algorithms  to  be  more  inclusive  and  consider  the  complex  ways  in  which  identity  and  status interact.

## APPLE CARD CREDIT LIMITS: BIAS IN FINANCIAL SERVICES AI

## Overview

In 2019, Apple Card faced backlash for giving women lower credit limits than men. For example, one case showed that in a couple, a wife, despite having a better credit score, was offered a limit 20 times lower than the husband. This happened because the AI behind the system likely used old financial patterns that favoured men, reinforcing inequalities in credit decisions.

## Intersectionality at play

This  bias  didn't  just  affect  women  generally-it  hit  women  in  non-traditional  financial  situations particularly hard. For example, women who shared joint accounts or had caregiving roles might not fit  the  algorithm's  assumptions  about  financial  independence.  This  highlights  how  traditional financial norms can combine with AI bias to create additional hurdles for some groups.

## Why intersectionality matters

Bias in financial systems is not just about gender but also about societal norms that shape financial profiles. Women who have career breaks or shared finances may be disproportionately impacted because their financial  histories  don't  align  with  the  data  the  AI  was  trained  on.  Understanding how these factors overlap is crucial to making financial AI fair for everyone.

## GENDER AND SKIN-TYPE BIAS IN FACIAL RECOGNITION

## Overview

In 2018, a study by MIT Media Lab researcher Joy Buolamwini found significant gender and skintype bias in  widely-used facial  recognition  systems.  It  found  that  facial  recognition  AI  struggled most with darker-skinned  women,  with  error  rates  up  to  34.7%,  compared  to  less  than  1%  for lighter-skinned  men.  This  was  because  the  systems  were  trained  on  mostly  light-skinned,  male faces, leading to poor accuracy for anyone outside that group.

## Intersectionality at play

The biases identified in these systems were not confined to one aspect of identity but arose at the intersection  of  gender  and  skin  type.  Darker-skinned  women  faced  the  highest  misclassification rates,  reflecting  the  compounding  disadvantages  they  experience  due  to  their  position  at  the intersection  of  race  and  gender.  These  mistakes  can  lead  to  serious  consequences,  like  unfair treatment in policing or job applications.

## Why intersectionality matters

Intersectionality is crucial to understanding how AI systems disproportionately affect marginalised communities. In this case, the intersection of race and gender magnified the inaccuracies of the facial  recognition  models,  demonstrating  that  bias  cannot  be  addressed  by  looking  at  isolated categories  of  identity.  Recognising  these  intersecting  factors  reveals  how  societal  inequities become embedded in AI, making it essential to include diverse datasets and perspectives during development.  Without  this  lens,  efforts  to  address  bias  risk  overlooking  the  compounded disadvantages  faced  by  groups  like  darker-skinned  women,  perpetuating  structural  inequality  in new, automated forms.

## NATIONAL UNEMPLOYMENT AGENCY IN AUSTRIA: GENDERED AND SOCIOECONOMIC BIASES

## Overview

The AI system used by Austria's National Unemployment Agency aimed to match job seekers with employment  opportunities  but  exhibited  significant  bias  against  women,  particularly  those  who had been unemployed for long periods or had worked part-time. The system penalised women for employment gaps and part-time work, which are often associated with caregiving roles or other gendered social expectations, thus limiting their access to job opportunities

## Intersectionality at play

The  biases  in  the  system  are  rooted  in  both  gender  and  socioeconomic  factors.  For  women, especially  those  who  have  taken  breaks  from  the  workforce  (for  maternity  or  caregiving),  the algorithm penalised employment gaps. This exacerbates existing gender inequalities, as women are often more likely than men to have non-linear career paths due to societal expectations around caregiving. Additionally, women in lower-income or part-time employment are doubly disadvantaged by the system's reliance on rigid employment history metrics that fail to account for the socio-economic context behind these career gaps. Women with disabilities, especially those in part-time or intermittent work, may also face compounded disadvantages.

## Why intersectionality matters

Intersectionality  is  crucial  in  understanding  how  women,  particularly  those  with  caregiving responsibilities or in part-time roles, are unfairly  impacted  by  this  AI  system.  Gendered assumptions about work and career paths lead to a biased algorithm that disregards the socioeconomic  realities  faced  by  women,  reinforcing  historical  inequalities  in  employment.  The algorithm's failure to account for the intersection of gender and socioeconomic status results in systemic barriers that limit women's opportunities for employment. Recognising these intersectional biases is key to designing fairer systems that consider the complexities of individual lives and employment trajectories, particularly for women who face both societal and algorithmic disadvantages.

## THE IMPACT OF FLAWED ALGORITHMS: A CASE STUDY ON RISCANVI

## Overview

The RisCanvi algorithm in Catalonia's prison system assesses inmates' recidivism risk using data such as age, gender, and nationality. The algorithm has been found to be inaccurate and biased, with over 80% of inmates flagged as high-risk not reoffending.

## Intersectionality at play

The system disproportionately impacts foreign nationals, particularly immigrants and people from marginalised  ethnic  groups,  by  over-predicting  their  likelihood  of  reoffending.  This  exacerbates systemic biases within the criminal justice system, where certain groups-especially people of color and  immigrants-are  already  at  a  disadvantage.  The  lack  of  transparency  and  human  oversight makes it harder to challenge these biased outcomes.

## Why intersectionality matters

The  combination  of  race,  nationality,  and  socio-economic  background  creates  a  higher  risk  of biased  outcomes  for  marginalised  individuals.  By  failing  to  consider  these  intersections,  the algorithm reinforces existing societal inequalities, leading to unjust parole denials and perpetuating discrimination. Understanding intersectionality in this context allows us to see that it is not just about  a  singular  characteristic  (e.g.,  gender  or  race)  but  how  multiple  forms  of  disadvantage compound to create unfair outcomes.

## WELFARE FRAUD CASE IN DENMARK: TARGETING MARGINALISED GROUPS

## Overview

In Denmark, the welfare authority Udbetaling Danmark (UDK) uses AI algorithms to detect welfare fraud. The  system  has  been  criticised for targeting individuals  from  marginalised  groups, particularly those with disabilities, people from racial minorities, and those in non-traditional family structures.  These  groups  face  disproportionate  scrutiny  under  the  algorithm,  which  exacerbates existing disparities.

## Intersectionality at play

The intersection of race, disability, and non-traditional family structures makes certain individuals more vulnerable to being flagged by the system. For example, a Black person with a disability who is part of a single-parent household might face compounded discrimination, as the algorithm may flag  them  due  to  the  combination  of  these  intersecting  factors.  Additionally,  people  in  nontraditional family structures may be wrongly flagged because their profiles don't conform to the system's assumptions about "normal" family arrangements.

## Why intersectionality matters

Intersectionality  is  crucial  in  understanding  how  this  AI  system  disproportionately  impacts individuals  at  the  intersections  of  multiple  marginalized  identities.  People  who  are  already disadvantaged in one area-whether because of race, disability, or family structure-are more likely to  experience  unjust  treatment  because  of  the  compounded  effects  of  these  biases.  Without addressing  these  intersectional  biases,  AI  systems  risk  perpetuating  and  deepening  existing inequalities in welfare and social services.
