# Summary: Ricaurte Quijano 2024 Towards

## Overview

This November 2024 GPAI-endorsed report addresses a critical gap in AI governance by examining how to achieve genuine gender equality and diversity in artificial intelligence systems. Developed through a formal project titled "Towards Real Diversity and Gender Equality in AI: Evidence-Based Promising Practices and Recommendations," the document was declassified and made publicly available by the GPAI Responsible AI Working Group, signifying its authoritative policy status. Led by scholars at Tecnológico de Monterrey, Harvard University's Berkman Klein Center, and Mila (Quebec AI Institute), the research advocates for **transformative AI policy** grounded in substantive equality principles rather than formal compliance. The document fundamentally challenges techno-optimistic narratives by positioning gender and diversity as systemic governance imperatives requiring structural intervention, not peripheral concerns addressable through technical solutions alone.

## Main Findings

The analysis identifies that current AI development perpetuates and amplifies existing gender and diversity gaps through three interconnected mechanisms: (1) structural inequalities embedded in technical systems and algorithms; (2) organizational practices within AI development ecosystems that exclude marginalized groups; and (3) policy frameworks that prioritize innovation over equity. The document establishes that formal equality approaches—ensuring equal representation or access—prove fundamentally insufficient for addressing substantive inequalities rooted in power asymmetries. Key findings demonstrate that evidence-based promising practices exist across diverse global contexts (Africa, Asia, Latin America, Europe, North America) yet remain fragmented and underutilized in policy design. The research concludes that transformative solutions require intersectional approaches acknowledging how gender inequality compounds with disability, indigenous status, geographic marginalization, and economic precarity. Critical recommendations address policy design, implementation accountability mechanisms, and stakeholder engagement frameworks, though specific policy recommendations remain detailed in the full document beyond this excerpt.

## Methodology/Approach

The project employs rigorous collaborative methodology combining participatory research with evidence synthesis across 30+ international stakeholders. The **Project Advisory Group** (30+ members) provides ongoing guidance and validation, while the **Consultation Expert Group** (6 members) contributed formative expertise during research development stages. Geographic representation spans five continents: Africa (AIMS, Research ICT Africa), Asia (Taiwan, India, Japan), Latin America (Mexico, Brazil), Europe (Nordic countries, Mediterranean), and North America (Canada, USA). Disciplinary expertise encompasses computer science, law, governance studies, feminist theory, indigenous knowledge systems, disability rights, and digital rights advocacy. The framework synthesizes **evidence-based policy development** by identifying and evaluating promising practices across contexts, grounded in **substantive equality theory** emphasizing structural transformation. The participatory design ensures recommendations reflect diverse lived experiences and contextual realities rather than imposing universal solutions.

## Relevant Concepts

**Substantive Equality**: Moving beyond formal equality (equal treatment) toward addressing systemic inequalities and their root causes, ensuring genuine opportunity and outcomes in AI development and deployment.

**Transformative Policy**: Policy interventions designed to fundamentally restructure AI systems and governance rather than implement incremental adjustments, targeting underlying power dynamics, institutional barriers, and exclusionary practices.

**Intersectionality**: Analytical framework recognizing how multiple marginalized identities (gender, race, disability, geography, economic status) interact and compound inequalities in complex, non-additive ways within AI contexts.

**Substantive Equality in AI**: Specific application of equality theory to artificial intelligence, addressing how algorithmic systems, development practices, and governance structures embed and perpetuate discrimination.

**Responsible AI Governance**: Framework for developing, deploying, and regulating AI systems accountable to public interest through stakeholder participation, equity-centered design, and structural accountability—distinct from ethics-focused approaches that lack enforcement mechanisms.

## Significance

This work represents a watershed contribution to AI governance discourse by institutionalizing gender and diversity concerns within GPAI's authoritative policy framework and securing formal declassification for public availability. Its significance derives from bridging academic research and policy practice through rigorous evidence synthesis and deliberate global stakeholder engagement (30+ advisory members across five continents). By advancing substantive equality frameworks specifically for AI contexts, the document provides actionable guidance for policymakers, technologists, and civil society organizations. The deliberate incorporation of indigenous perspectives (Indigenous AI, Te Kotahi Research Institute), disability rights (International Disability Alliance), and Global South voices (Africa, Latin America, Asia representation) challenges dominant Western-centric AI governance narratives. The document's theoretical contribution—positioning gender and diversity as structural governance imperatives rather than peripheral ethics concerns—fundamentally reframes AI policy discourse. Ultimately, this research establishes that achieving genuine equality in AI requires transformative policy commitment addressing systemic inequalities at their source, not technical fixes or compliance measures.
