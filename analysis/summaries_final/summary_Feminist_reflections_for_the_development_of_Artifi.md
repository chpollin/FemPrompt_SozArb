# Summary: Feminist reflections for the development of Artifi

## Overview
This academic document, "Towards a feminist framework for AI development: from principles to practice" by Juliana Guerra, explores the possibility of developing Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems that do not perpetuate or reproduce existing logics of oppression. Situated within a Latin American context, the work critically examines the power relations embedded within the AI field. It argues that current AI configurations often reinforce historical systems of injustice such as colonialism, racism, and classism. The document aims to bridge theoretical feminist principles with practical applications, culminating in a guide for developing AI systems that are more equitable and just.

## Main Findings
The document's structure anticipates its main findings, which will culminate in a practical guide for feminist AI development. Key anticipated findings include: AI is inherently non-neutral and deeply influenced by power structures and the biases of its creators and data sources ("All intelligence is embodied"). The prevalent "digestive data system" contributes significantly to bias, necessitating alternative approaches to data management, auditability, and reuse from a feminist perspective. The work will demonstrate that developing non-oppressive AI requires a shift towards understanding AI as a collective process, prioritizing community needs, and fostering collaborative knowledge exchange. The ultimate finding will be a set of actionable guidelines for organizations and communities to consciously and ethically develop AI systems.

## Methodology/Approach
The methodology employed is an "interpretative analysis" grounded in qualitative research. It involves examining the lived experiences of seven women working in AI or data science within Latin America. These empirical insights are then critically engaged with established "feminist principles and guidelines for the development and deployment of digital technologies." This approach allows for a contextualized understanding of how power dynamics manifest in AI development, drawing on both theoretical frameworks and practical, regional experiences. The narrative structure of the document itself reflects the identified practical principles, moving from theoretical grounding to concrete recommendations.

## Relevant Concepts
*   **Logics of Oppression:** Refers to the systemic and historical patterns of discrimination and disadvantage based on factors like colonialism, racism, and classism, which the document argues are often reproduced by current AI systems.
*   **Embodied Intelligence:** The concept that intelligence, including AI, is not abstract or neutral but is shaped by the specific contexts, biases, and experiences of its creators, data, and deployment environments.
*   **Digestive Data System:** A critical term used to describe the uncritical or unexamined consumption and processing of data, which can lead to the perpetuation and amplification of biases present in the original datasets.
*   **Auditability:** The ability to trace, understand, and verify the processes, data, and decisions made by an AI system, crucial for identifying and mitigating biases and harmful impacts.
*   **Speculative Doing:** A practical approach that encourages imaginative and forward-thinking methods for AI development, aiming to actively design systems that challenge existing norms and prevent the reproduction of oppressive structures.

## Significance
This document holds significant value by contributing to the burgeoning field of critical AI studies, particularly from a Global South perspective. It moves beyond abstract ethical discussions to offer a tangible, practice-oriented framework for developing AI that is socially responsible and equitable. By centering feminist principles and the experiences of women in Latin America, it challenges the dominant, often Western-centric and corporate-driven, narratives of AI development. Its focus on practical guidelines makes it a valuable resource for practitioners, policymakers, and communities seeking to build AI systems that genuinely serve human well-being and promote social justice, rather than reinforcing existing inequalities.
