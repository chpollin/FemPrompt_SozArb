# Summary: Gengler 2024 Faires

## Overview

This document is a practical implementation guide developed by the Mittelstand-Digital Zentrum Zukunftskultur—part of a federally-supported digitalization network funded by Germany's Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Klimaschutz—in collaboration with feminist AI and enableYou Consulting. It targets both SME leadership and employees navigating generative AI adoption across organizational workflows. Rather than functioning as traditional academic research, it serves as an actionable resource addressing the critical gap between theoretical AI ethics and organizational practice. The guide's central premise acknowledges that while generative AI systems—capable of autonomously producing texts, images, and multimedia content—offer substantial innovation and efficiency benefits, their deployment carries significant ethical risks and societal responsibilities. The document positions itself as a "compass" enabling business leaders to shape digital futures proactively rather than reactively adapting to technological change, with particular emphasis on ensuring fair and diverse AI-generated outcomes in concrete applications like marketing content generation, recruitment materials, and applicant image creation.

## Main Findings

The analysis reveals five interconnected findings: First, generative AI has become deeply embedded in routine organizational workflows across diverse sectors, from marketing content generation to recruitment materials and applicant screening. Second, without deliberate intervention and awareness, current AI implementations risk perpetuating and amplifying existing societal biases regarding gender, ethnicity, and other demographic factors. Third, most SMEs currently lack adequate governance frameworks and practical tools for implementing fair AI deployment. Fourth, there exists substantial demand for accessible, non-technical guidance that bridges the gap between abstract ethical principles and concrete organizational decision-making. Fifth, the document emphasizes that understanding the "why" behind AI deployment—not merely the "what" and "how"—is essential for responsible implementation, requiring fundamental organizational culture change beyond technical solutions.

## Methodology/Approach

The guide employs a prescriptive-normative methodology combining expert consultation with applied learning frameworks designed for non-technical audiences. Rather than conducting empirical research or theoretical analysis, it synthesizes insights from specialized consultants, feminist AI perspectives, and named domain experts (Eva Gengler, Andreas Kraus, Lisa Krawczyk, Maren Burghard, Dr. Sabine Lang, and Sibylle Riehle). The approach integrates business pragmatism with ethical considerations, suggesting a stakeholder-inclusive governance model. This methodology prioritizes accessibility and practical applicability for SME leadership and employee audiences over academic rigor or technical depth, positioning guidance within a federal policy context supporting SME digitalization.

## Relevant Concepts

**Generative AI**: Autonomous systems producing original content (text, images, multimedia) without explicit programming for each output.

**Fair AI Prompting**: Strategic input design ensuring AI-generated outputs actively reflect diversity and inclusivity rather than passively perpetuating systemic biases.

**Responsible AI Governance**: Organizational frameworks ensuring ethical, transparent, and fair AI deployment aligned with societal values and stakeholder interests.

**Bias Perpetuation Mechanisms**: Systematic ways AI systems amplify existing societal inequities embedded in training data and algorithmic design.

**Feminist AI**: Critical analytical approach examining power dynamics, gender bias, and systemic inequities embedded in AI systems, development processes, and organizational implementation.

**Organizational Culture Change**: Fundamental shifts in how organizations conceptualize and implement technology, moving beyond technical solutions to value-aligned practices.

**Knowledge Gap**: Documented absence of accessible guidance resources for non-technical organizations implementing AI responsibly.

## Significance

This guide addresses a critical lacuna in responsible AI governance literature by bridging academic ethics frameworks with practical SME implementation needs. Its significance lies in democratizing AI governance knowledge, moving beyond elite technical and academic circles to enable broader organizational participation in shaping fair AI futures. The explicit integration of feminist AI perspectives signals alignment with critical AI studies examining structural inequities. By targeting SMEs—organizations often overlooked in AI policy discussions—the guide acknowledges that responsible AI implementation is not exclusively a concern for large technology corporations. The federal policy backing (BMWK support) provides institutional legitimacy and positions responsible AI governance as a national digitalization priority. This work contributes to emerging "responsible AI governance for practitioners" discourse, establishing that ethical AI deployment requires organizational culture change, not merely technical solutions, and that fair outcomes require active design intervention rather than passive compliance.
