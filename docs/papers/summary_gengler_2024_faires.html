<h1>Summary: Gengler 2024 Faires</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>"Faires KI-Prompting" is a practitioner-oriented guidance document explicitly designed for business leaders and employees in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) implementing generative artificial intelligence responsibly. Published by the Mittelstand-Digital Zentrum Zukunftskultur—part of Germany's federally-supported digital transformation network—the guide addresses a critical implementation gap: while generative AI systems (capable of autonomously producing text, images, and multimedia) are rapidly integrating into organizational workflows, most SME practitioners lack frameworks for ethical deployment. The document positions itself as a "compass" enabling organizations not merely to navigate AI adoption but to actively shape inclusive digital futures. Deliberately non-technical and accessibility-focused, it targets leaders without AI expertise, emphasizing that fair and diverse AI outcomes are achievable through informed decision-making and deliberate design choices rather than occurring automatically.</p>
<h2>Main Findings</h2>
<p>The guide establishes five core findings: (1) <strong>Generative AI is transformative yet risky</strong>—while enabling innovation, efficiency gains, and creative enhancement, these systems carry substantive ethical challenges requiring conscious management; (2) <strong>Fairness and diversity are implementable</strong>—fair outcomes result from deliberate prompting strategies and design choices, not technological inevitability; (3) <strong>Responsibility is operationalizable</strong>—business leaders can implement concrete ethical practices without advanced technical expertise; (4) <strong>Understanding precedes effective implementation</strong>—users must comprehend how systems function, appropriate applications, and inherent limitations; (5) <strong>AI-generated content requires critical evaluation</strong>—generative systems produce errors and biases, necessitating human oversight before deployment. The document emphasizes understanding both positive and negative impacts of generative AI, recognizing that identical technologies can either reinforce inequalities or advance inclusive outcomes depending on implementation choices.</p>
<h2>Methodology/Approach</h2>
<p>The guide employs a <strong>prescriptive-practical methodology</strong> combining expert consultation with institutional authority and normative frameworks. Development involved collaboration between AI trainers (Kristina Bodrožić-Brnić), specialized consultants (enableYou Consulting GmbH, feminist AI), and domain experts (Eva Gengler, Andreas Kraus, Lisa Krawczyk, Maren Burghard, Dr. Sabine Lang, Sibylle Riehle). Rather than conducting empirical research, authors synthesized existing knowledge within explicit normative commitments to ethics, diversity, and inclusivity. The theoretical foundation integrates <strong>responsible AI</strong> perspectives (emphasizing transparency, fairness, accountability) and <strong>feminist AI</strong> approaches (examining how systems perpetuate or challenge intersectional inequalities). Notably, the methodology prioritizes accessibility and practical applicability over academic rigor, deliberately avoiding technical jargon and framing content as a "journey" through AI concepts to maximize engagement with non-specialist audiences.</p>
<h2>Relevant Concepts</h2>
<strong>Generative AI</strong>: Self-operating systems autonomously producing original text, images, and multimedia content without explicit programming for each specific output; distinct from traditional AI systems requiring predetermined responses.
<strong>Fair Prompting</strong>: Strategic formulation of user instructions to generative AI systems designed to produce equitable, unbiased, and inclusive outputs; core operational practice for achieving fairness.
<strong>Responsible AI</strong>: Governance framework ensuring AI systems operate with transparency, fairness, and accountability while minimizing harm and enabling human oversight.
<strong>Feminist AI</strong>: Analytical approach examining how AI systems perpetuate, challenge, or intersect with gender-based and structural inequalities across diverse populations.
<strong>Diversity and Inclusion by Design</strong>: Intentional architectural and operational choices embedding fairness principles into AI applications from inception rather than treating them as post-deployment corrections.
<strong>Prompting</strong>: User-generated instructions or queries directing generative AI system behavior; distinct from traditional programming and requiring new literacy skills.
<h2>Significance</h2>
<p>This document addresses urgent practical needs as generative AI adoption accelerates across European SMEs, with particular significance in three dimensions. <strong>First, democratization</strong>: It distributes AI ethics literacy and implementation capacity beyond large corporations with dedicated teams, preventing two-tier systems where only well-resourced enterprises practice ethical AI. <strong>Second, policy alignment</strong>: The work reflects contemporary European governance approaches (particularly German frameworks) emphasizing precautionary principles, stakeholder participation, and distributed responsibility for technological outcomes. <strong>Third, behavioral change</strong>: By emphasizing "why" alongside "how" and "what," the guide recognizes that sustainable implementation requires understanding underlying principles, not merely technical instructions. The explicit focus on diverse and inclusive outcomes—rather than treating fairness as optional—signals institutional commitment to ensuring AI benefits distribute equitably across society. Concrete use cases (recruitment image generation, marketing content creation) ground abstract principles in recognizable organizational contexts, enhancing practical applicability for SME leaders navigating real implementation decisions.</p>
