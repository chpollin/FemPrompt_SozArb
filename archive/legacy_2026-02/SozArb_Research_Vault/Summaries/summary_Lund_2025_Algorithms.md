## Overview
This report examines whether Norway's Equality and Anti-Discrimination (EAD) Act adequately addresses discrimination caused by algorithmic and AI systems. Written by Professor Vibeke Blaker Strand and published by the Equality and Anti-Discrimination Ombud (LDO), the research identifies a critical regulatory gap: existing discrimination law predates algorithmic technologies, creating uncertainty about how traditional legal concepts apply to automated decision-making. The central thesis is that current legislation is technically applicable but substantively insufficient, requiring explicit provisions clarifying enforcement mechanisms, preventive duties, and lawful algorithmic differential treatment standards.

## Main Findings

1. **Legislative Gap:** The EAD Act lacks precision for algorithmic discrimination cases; current direct/indirect discrimination frameworks are inadequate for automated systems that operate through novel mechanisms.

2. **Proxy Discrimination Problem:** Algorithms blur legal distinctions by using proxy factors that indirectly trigger protected characteristic discrimination, creating a category not captured by traditional legal categories.

3. **Regulatory Complexity:** Three overlapping frameworks (EAD Act, EU AI Act, GDPR) create incomplete coverage with unclear enforcement boundaries and conflicting requirements.

4. **Burden of Proof Challenges:** Traditional discrimination law's burden of proof mechanisms are difficult to apply when algorithmic decision-making lacks transparency and explainability.

5. **Section 9 Limitations:** Provisions on lawful differential treatment are designed for employment contexts, not algorithmic systems, leaving algorithmic actors without clear compliance standards.

6. **Preventive Opportunity:** Article 10(5) of the AI Act permits special data processing for bias detection in high-risk AI systems, offering a preventive discrimination tool currently underutilized.

## Methodology/Approach
The research employs legal analysis examining three intersecting regulatory frameworks through comparative statutory interpretation. The methodology analyzes how current discrimination law provisions apply to algorithmic contexts by examining statutory language, legal distinctions between direct and indirect discrimination, and identifying conceptual misalignments between traditional frameworks and algorithmic discrimination mechanisms. Rather than empirical data collection, the study conducts doctrinal legal analysis of Norwegian EAD Act provisions, EU/EEA directives, the AI Act, and GDPR requirements. The analysis identifies gaps through systematic examination of how existing legal categories fail to capture algorithmic discrimination mechanisms.

## Relevant Concepts

**Direct Discrimination:** Differential treatment based explicitly on a protected characteristic (e.g., gender, ethnicity), requiring intentional or deliberate action.

**Indirect Discrimination:** Neutral rules or practices that disproportionately disadvantage individuals with a protected characteristic, often unintentional but still unlawful.

**Proxy Discrimination:** Algorithmic discrimination using proxy factors (e.g., zip code, shopping patterns) that indirectly correlate with protected characteristics without explicit reference to them.

**Algorithmic Differential Treatment:** Automated systems producing different outcomes for individuals based on algorithmic decision-making, distinct from traditional differential treatment concepts.

**Burden of Proof:** Legal requirement that claimants demonstrate discrimination; shifts to defendants when prima facie evidence exists, creating challenges in algorithmic contexts due to opacity.

**High-Risk AI Systems:** AI applications with significant potential for discrimination or rights violations, subject to enhanced transparency and bias-detection requirements under the AI Act.

**Lawful Differential Treatment:** Exceptions permitting differential treatment when objectively justified by legitimate aims and proportionate means, requiring clarification for algorithmic contexts.

## Practical Implications

**For Social Workers:**
- Recognize algorithmic bias in automated welfare eligibility systems and document discriminatory outcomes for advocacy purposes
- Request algorithmic impact assessments when clients face adverse decisions from automated systems

**For Organizations:**
- Implement bias detection protocols under AI Act Article 10(5) before deploying high-risk algorithmic systems
- Establish clear documentation of algorithmic decision-making processes to satisfy transparency and accountability requirements
- Conduct regular algorithmic audits examining proxy discrimination risks and disparate impact on protected groups

**For Policymakers:**
- Revise the EAD Act with explicit provisions defining algorithmic discrimination, proxy discrimination, and lawful algorithmic differential treatment standards
- Clarify enforcement mechanisms and reporting duties for actors deploying algorithmic systems
- Harmonize overlapping requirements across EAD Act, AI Act, and GDPR frameworks

**For Researchers:**
- Investigate practical implementation challenges of proposed algorithmic discrimination provisions
- Examine enforcement practices and case outcomes in algorithmic discrimination disputes
- Analyze technological feasibility of bias detection and transparency requirements

## Limitations & Open Questions

**Limitations:**
- Analysis focuses on Norwegian law and EU/EEA frameworks, limiting generalizability to other jurisdictions
- Research emphasizes statutory language rather than case law or enforcement practice
- Limited discussion of practical implementation challenges and technological feasibility
- Does not comprehensively address all algorithmic contexts or emerging discrimination mechanisms

**Open Questions:**
- How should burden of proof standards be adapted for opaque algorithmic systems?
- What specific algorithmic audit standards constitute adequate compliance?
- How do proxy discrimination mechanisms vary across different algorithmic applications?

## Relation to Other Research

- **AI Governance and Regulation:** Connects to broader literature examining how legal frameworks adapt to emerging technologies, particularly tensions between prescriptive regulation and technological innovation.

- **Algorithmic Accountability:** Relates to research on transparency, explainability, and accountability mechanisms for automated decision-making systems.

- **Discrimination Law Evolution:** Contributes to scholarship examining how traditional equality law concepts apply to novel discrimination mechanisms.

- **Comparative Equality Law:** Engages with international research on implementing EU equality directives across member states with varying technological contexts.

## Significance
This research is significant because it identifies concrete regulatory gaps affecting vulnerable populations subject to algorithmic discrimination in employment, housing, credit, and welfare contexts. By demonstrating that existing legislation is technically applicable but substantively insufficient, the report provides evidence-based justification for targeted legal reform. The framework developed—particularly regarding proxy discrimination and algorithmic differential treatment—offers a model for other jurisdictions developing algorithmic governance. The findings are timely as AI deployment accelerates, making proactive legal clarification essential before discriminatory harms become entrenched in automated systems. The report bridges legal scholarship and policy practice, providing actionable recommendations for legislators, enforcement agencies, and organizations implementing algorithmic systems.
