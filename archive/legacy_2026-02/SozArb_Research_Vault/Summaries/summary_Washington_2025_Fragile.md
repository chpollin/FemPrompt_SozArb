# Summary: Washington 2025 Fragile

## Overview

"Fragile Foundations: Hidden Risks of Generative AI" is a critical policy analysis by Dr. Anne L. Washington (Duke University), published by Bertelsmann Stiftung in September 2025. The document systematically examines structural vulnerabilities in foundation models—large-scale AI systems powering ChatGPT, Gemini, and similar applications. Washington argues that risks stem not from technical limitations alone but from systemic failures in data quality, business models, and computational design. The analysis addresses a critical governance gap by demonstrating how economic incentives and social biases become embedded in generative AI systems at scale, ultimately shaping digital infrastructure affecting billions of users. The work bridges academic AI ethics with actionable policy recommendations for policymakers and practitioners.

## Main Findings

Washington identifies four interconnected risk categories. **Data quality problems** reveal that training datasets contain unaddressed biases, poor curation, and representation gaps that propagate through AI systems with amplified consequences. **Business model constraints** demonstrate that proprietary development prioritizes rapid deployment and profit over safety and harm prevention. **False certainty** describes systematic user overestimation of AI reliability despite inherent limitations. **Structural barriers**—including resource-intensive computing, data monocultures, and recycled historical errors—create systemic obstacles to responsible development. Critically, foundation models amplify existing biases and automate cultural associations at unprecedented scale while externalizing environmental and computational costs. Washington proposes four solution categories: (1) **computational alternatives** improving efficiency; (2) **participatory alternatives** enabling inclusive design; (3) **source alternatives** ensuring diverse, deliberate representation; (4) **collaboration alternatives** supporting open development. Governance should emulate public libraries: transparent, deliberately curated, continuously improved, and publicly accessible rather than proprietary and static.

## Methodology/Approach

The document employs critical policy analysis synthesizing existing literature on AI risks and governance. Washington systematically categorizes structural barriers across data, business, computational, and cultural dimensions through comparative analysis contrasting current practices with proposed alternatives. The theoretical framework draws from critical AI studies, emphasizing how technical systems embed social and economic structures. Rather than conducting original empirical research, the analysis maps problems to solutions across four distinct frameworks. This methodology prioritizes accessibility for non-academic audiences while maintaining analytical rigor, bridging scholarship with implementation guidance.

## Relevant Concepts

**Foundation models:** Large-scale AI systems trained on vast datasets, versatile across applications

**Data monocultures:** Homogeneous training datasets lacking diversity, systematically amplifying embedded biases

**Deliberate representation:** Intentional, curated inclusion of diverse perspectives rather than passive diversity

**Data recycling:** Perpetuation of historical errors through retraining on contaminated datasets

**Cultural associations:** Automated encoding of social biases and stereotypes within model outputs

**Structural barriers:** Systemic obstacles—not individual failures—preventing responsible AI development

**False certainty:** User overconfidence in AI reliability despite inherent uncertainties and limitations

**Public-interest models:** Alternative governance frameworks prioritizing transparency, accountability, and continuous improvement over profit maximization

## Significance

This work significantly advances critical AI governance discourse by reframing foundation model risks as structural rather than technical problems requiring systemic reform. It challenges the assumption that algorithmic improvements ensure responsible AI, instead advocating regulatory frameworks and alternative development models. The library-based governance metaphor provides concrete institutional alternatives to proprietary approaches. By synthesizing fragmented concerns into coherent analysis with explicit problem-solution mapping, Washington advances emerging consensus that responsible AI demands social and economic transformation alongside technological innovation. The policy-oriented approach makes critical scholarship accessible to decision-makers, potentially influencing regulatory development and corporate governance. Its emphasis on participatory design, deliberate representation, and collaborative development reflects recognition that foundation model risks require structural change, not merely technical optimization.
