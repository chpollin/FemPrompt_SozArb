# Summary: McCrory_2024_Avoiding

SCORES:
Accuracy: 45
Completeness: 35
Structure: 70
Actionability: 60

IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED:
1. MAJOR: Summary fabricates specific findings that don't exist in original document. The original provides NO analysis of "seven global AI governance documents" with scoring rubrics (0-3 scale), UN resolutions, Asilomar Principles, OECD recommendations, or Seoul Declaration. These detailed findings are entirely invented.

2. MAJOR: Summary invents methodology details not in original. The original document excerpt ends mid-sentence ("In reiterating Beverly McPhail's (2003) notion of policy a") and provides NO information about scoring systems, specific documents analyzed, or quantitative evaluation frameworks described in the summary.

3. MAJOR: Summary presents conclusions as established findings when the original only outlines the research framework and problem statement. Claims like "No analyzed document achieved comprehensive intersectional analysis" and specific scoring results are fabricated.

4. The original document is incomplete (cuts off mid-word), making full validation impossible, but the summary goes far beyond what's present to invent an entire analysis section.

IMPROVED SUMMARY:

# Summary: Feminist Intersectionality in AI Safety Policy

## Overview

The AI safety movement has emerged as a critical discipline addressing existential risks from artificial general intelligence (AGI), with major governments and institutions establishing dedicated safety institutes. However, this forward-looking focus on hypothetical catastrophic risks obscures present harms already experienced by marginalized communities through discriminatory algorithms, data extraction, and exploitative labor practices. This working paper identifies a fundamental gap: AI safety governance frameworks lack meaningful engagement with feminist and intersectional perspectives, treating risks as universal rather than acknowledging how overlapping social identities create compounded vulnerabilities.

## Core Argument

AI safety proponents face criticism for a research agenda that is too forward-looking, neglecting current harms experienced by marginalized groups. Scholarship demonstrates how AI reinforces inequalities related to race, sexuality, class, and gender, creating environmental, racial, gendered, and neocolonial impacts. The field promotes universalized notions of safety that fail to hold developers accountable for practices of marginalization, extraction, and exploitation forming the basis of these models.

## Key Problems Identified

1. **Diversity gaps in AI research:** The field faces lack of diverse perspectives within technical development and lack of representation in policy narrative framing and ethical principles.

2. **Insular threat narratives:** When diverse perspectives are absent, narratives surrounding existential threats become insular, failing to adequately address questions of participation, accountability, and representation.

3. **Disconnect between future and present harms:** Current AI safety frameworks fail to acknowledge how future risks are tied to current harms. As AI systems regularly replicate broader social biases and power dynamics, an intersectional perspective must view future impacts as distinctly connected to current harms faced by marginalized groups.

4. **Universalized safety concepts:** AI safety promotes universalized notions of safety that fail to recognize how identical policies create inequitable outcomes across populations with different vulnerabilities.

## Methodology

This research employs a feminist policy analysis framework centered around five thematic areas: intersectionality, context, neutrality, control, and power. The framework analyzes global initiatives for AI safety governance to reveal how policies engage (or fail to engage) with feminist principles. [Note: The original document excerpt ends mid-sentence during methodology description; full analytical approach not available in provided text.]

## Relevant Concepts

**Intersectionality:** Framework recognizing how overlapping social identities (race, gender, class, sexuality, disability) create compounded discrimination and unique vulnerabilities.

**AI Safety:** Discipline addressing existential risks from artificial general intelligence through development of systems aligned with human values, ethics, explainability, and external control.

**Existential Risk:** Global terminal threat that would annihilate intelligent life or permanently curtail its potential.

**Data Feminism:** Analytical approach examining how power operates through data systems, centering marginalized perspectives.

## Key Recommendations

Future AI safety work can benefit from integrating feminist perspectives such as accountability and participation into research and policy development processes. This requires:
- Meaningful engagement with intersectional analysis
- Acknowledgment of how current harms connect to future risks
- Diverse representation in defining what constitutes existential threat
- Accountability mechanisms addressing whose values shape AI development

## Limitations

The provided document excerpt is incomplete, ending mid-sentence during the methodology section. Full analysis of specific governance documents and detailed findings are not available in the source material provided.
