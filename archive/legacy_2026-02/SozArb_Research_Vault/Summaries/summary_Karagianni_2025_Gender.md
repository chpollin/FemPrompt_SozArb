# Summary: Karagianni_2025_Gender

SCORES:
Accuracy: 92
Completeness: 88
Structure: 95
Actionability: 85

IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED:
1. The summary states gender is mentioned "only three times" but should clarify this refers specifically to "gender equality" language, as "gender" and "non-discrimination" appear more frequently throughout the Act—the original document's point is about the *absence of explicit gender equality framing* rather than total absence of gender references.

2. The summary omits the specific role of the European Parliament's LIBE and FEMM Committees mentioned in the original document's final paragraph, which is relevant context for understanding how gender considerations entered the AI Act's formulation.

3. The "Practical Implications" section, while well-developed, goes beyond what the original document explicitly states. The document proposes "feminist-informed revisions" but does not provide detailed implementation guidance for social workers, organizations, and policymakers—these are extrapolations rather than direct findings from the paper.

IMPROVED SUMMARY:

# Summary: Gender in the EU AI Act

## Overview
The EU AI Act (2024/1689) represents a significant regulatory effort to govern artificial intelligence systems, yet this research reveals critical gaps in addressing structural gender biases. While AI systems demonstrably harm women, LGBTQIA+ individuals, and marginalized communities—through biased recruitment algorithms, healthcare misgendering, and non-consensual deepfakes—the AI Act treats algorithmic discrimination as a technical rather than structural problem. The research gap centers on how legal frameworks can meaningfully protect gender-diverse populations when gender itself lacks explicit classification as a protected category. This paper argues that the AI Act's formalistic approach to non-discrimination fails to dismantle male-dominated norms embedded in AI development, training data, and regulatory oversight. The thesis contends that meaningful AI governance requires integrating feminist legal theory, intersectional analysis, and decolonial perspectives to center marginalized communities' lived experiences rather than treating gender equity as peripheral to AI regulation.

## Main Findings

1. **Legal classification gap**: Gender is not classified as a "special category" under GDPR Article 9(1), creating regulatory ambiguities that impede systematic efforts to address gender-based algorithmic discrimination.

2. **Minimal explicit gender equality framing**: The AI Act explicitly references "gender equality" only three times across its entire text (twice in Recitals 27 and 48, once in Article 95(2)(e)), despite extensive non-discrimination language, revealing deprioritization of gender-specific concerns. This absence reflects opposition from certain Member States (notably Poland) during the AI Act's formulation.

3. **Exclusion of gender-diverse identities**: The Act fails to account for transgender, non-binary, intersex, and gender non-conforming people, perpetuating binary gender frameworks that cause documented harms in healthcare and identification systems.

4. **Structural bias embedding**: Gender biases are not incidental technical flaws but structurally embedded in AI systems through biased training data and male-dominated development teams, requiring fundamental rather than superficial reform.

5. **Hermeneutical injustice in AI governance**: Marginalized groups lack epistemic resources to contest discriminatory AI systems, preventing recognition and articulation of gender-based algorithmic harms.

6. **Formalistic rather than substantive equality approach**: The AI Act treats algorithmic bias as a technical issue rather than addressing underlying power imbalances and male dominance in legal and data structures.

7. **Parliamentary advocacy role**: The European Parliament's LIBE (Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs) and FEMM (Women's Rights and Gender Equality) Committees played a pivotal role in advocating for amendments addressing gender concerns, though their influence remained limited in the final text.

## Methodology/Approach

This research employs critical feminist legal analysis examining specific EU AI Act articles with gendered implications. The study integrates theoretical frameworks including Miranda Fricker's hermeneutical injustice theory, Catharine MacKinnon's feminist legal theory on male dominance, and decolonial perspectives from Aníbal Quijano and Walter Mignolo. The methodology combines doctrinal legal examination with intersectional analysis, revealing how gender discrimination intersects with race, class, and other protected characteristics. Real-world case studies—Amazon's biased recruitment tool, healthcare system misgendering of transgender patients, and non-consensual deepfakes—ground theoretical analysis in concrete harms. The research conducts text analysis of AI Act provisions, comparing de lege lata (current law) and de lege ferenda (proposed law) interpretations to identify regulatory gaps and propose feminist-informed revisions.

## Relevant Concepts

**Hermeneutical Injustice:** A form of epistemic injustice where marginalized groups lack conceptual resources to understand and articulate their experiences, preventing recognition of discriminatory harms within legal and technical systems.

**Coloniality of Power:** The ongoing dominance of Western epistemologies, legal structures, and institutions that marginalizes Indigenous, African, and non-Western knowledge systems and governance approaches.

**Algorithmic Discrimination:** Systematic disadvantage produced by AI systems through biased training data, flawed design, or deployment in contexts where algorithms reinforce existing social inequalities.

**Substantive Equality:** An approach requiring active restructuring of policies and systems to dismantle power imbalances, contrasting with formal equality that treats all groups identically regardless of structural disadvantage.

**Intersectionality:** Framework recognizing that individuals hold multiple, intersecting identities (gender, race, class, sexuality) whose discrimination cannot be understood through single-axis analysis alone.

**Decoloniality of Law:** Legal interpretation incorporating historical consciousness of colonial violence and epistemic injustice, centering marginalized jurisprudence rather than exclusively Eurocentric frameworks.

**Male Dominance Theory:** Feminist legal framework arguing that law reflects and reinforces male-centered norms, requiring examination of how legal structures embed patriarchal power.

## Proposed Revisions

The paper advocates for feminist-informed revisions to the AI Act emphasizing:
- Explicit classification of gender as a protected category enabling discrimination prevention
- Specific protections for gender-diverse identities (transgender, non-binary, intersex, gender non-conforming)
- Intersectional accountability mechanisms requiring organizations to demonstrate how AI systems avoid compounding discrimination across multiple identity dimensions
- Integration of decolonial perspectives centering marginalized communities' lived experiences in AI governance

## Limitations & Open Questions

**Limitations:**
- Early AI Act drafts lacked explicit gender equality references due to Member State opposition (notably Poland), potentially limiting political feasibility of proposed revisions.
- Analysis focuses on EU legal frameworks, potentially limiting generalizability to other jurisdictions with different legal traditions and protections.
- Real-world case studies, while illustrative, may not comprehensively represent all gender-based AI harms across sectors and populations globally.

**Open Questions:**
- How can policymakers balance competing Member State interests while strengthening gender protections in AI governance?
- What enforcement mechanisms would effectively hold organizations accountable for gender-based algorithmic discrimination?
- How do decolonial approaches to AI governance translate across diverse legal and cultural contexts?

## Relation to Other Research

- **Algorithmic bias and discrimination:** Connects to broader research demonstrating how AI systems perpetuate existing social inequalities through biased training data and design.
- **Feminist legal theory and technology:** Relates to scholarship examining how legal frameworks either reinforce or challenge patriarchal power structures embedded in technological systems.
- **Intersectionality in policy:** Builds on intersectional analysis showing how single-axis protections inadequately address compounded discrimination affecting multiply-marginalized populations.
- **Decolonial governance:** Engages with decolonial scholarship critiquing Eurocentric legal frameworks and advocating for epistemically diverse governance approaches.

## Significance

This research is critical because AI regulation shapes whether marginalized communities experience technological systems as liberatory or oppressive. Current regulatory gaps mean women, LGBTQIA+ individuals, and racialized populations lack legal protection against documented algorithmic harms. By demonstrating that the AI Act's formalistic approach perpetuates rather than prevents gender-based discrimination, this work establishes urgent need for structural reform. The research's integration of feminist legal theory, intersectionality, and decolonial perspectives offers a framework for more equitable AI governance globally. Theoretically, it advances understanding of how law either challenges or reinforces power imbalances in technological systems, contributing to broader conversations about justice, equity, and whose knowledge counts in governance.
