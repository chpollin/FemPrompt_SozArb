## Abstract

Structural analysis examines how Big Tech corporations exercise "entrepreneurial private authority" through algorithmic governance systems challenging state sovereignty. Moves beyond individual-focused approaches to analyze how technology firms exercise instrumental, structural, and discursive power globally. Critiques approaches focusing on individual user agency or technical fixes, examining instead how "Big Tech's algorithmic governance incentivizes 'information pollution'" and creates systemic power imbalances.
