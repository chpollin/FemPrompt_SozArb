## Abstract

This framework defines Critical AI Literacy as expanding beyond traditional AI literacy to examine how Large Language Models contribute to ongoing epistemic injustices that can lead to significant social and personal harm. It applies equality, diversity, inclusion, and accessibility principles to AI use, emphasizing the importance of critically evaluating AI-generated outputs and engaging in equitable and inclusive prompting practices. Critical AI Literacy is conceptualized as context-specific and treats literacy as a social practice rather than a possession. At advanced levels, it examines AI's potential to shift power relationships and explores how AI contributes to inequalities while considering ways it could help redress power balances.
