## Abstract

Critical ethnographic study examining how datafication and digitalization in Denmark's healthcare sector erode professional judgment and create meaningless work through surveillance and control mechanisms. Authors challenge policy narratives that more data leads to better, evidence-based healthcare decisions, revealing instead how data-intensive practices create Kafkaesque idiocy reconfiguring perceptions of work and undermining goal orientation. Key critical insights demonstrate how dual ambitions of datafication introduce detailed surveillance tools regulating what counts as knowledge, forcing professionals into documentation activities divorced from care relationships. Reveals how data work serves administrative inspection rather than professional expertise, threatening autonomy essential to professional practice.
