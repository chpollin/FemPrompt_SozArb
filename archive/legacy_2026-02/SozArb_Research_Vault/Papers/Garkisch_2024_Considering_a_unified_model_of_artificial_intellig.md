## Abstract

Systematic review mapping research landscape of social work AI scholarship, analyzing 67 articles using qualitative analytic approaches to explore how social work researchers investigate AI. Identified themes consistent with Staub-Bernasconi's triple mandate covering profession level, social agencies/organizations, and clients. Emphasizes importance of enhancing computational thinking, AI literacy, and data literacy, and developing skills for evaluating automated systems. Stresses that professionals must be educated and sensitized to data and AI literacy with regular training opportunities.
