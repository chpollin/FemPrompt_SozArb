## Abstract

Develops EPIC model (Ethics and justice, Policy development and advocacy, Intersectoral collaboration, Community engagement and empowerment) as structured approach for AI integration in social work. Emphasizes that AI integration must align with social work mission and values through four overlapping components. Ethics and justice aspect addresses bias mitigation and transparent use, while policy development prioritizes client protection. Warns against excessive calibration of AI systems toward trustworthiness that could impair utility, emphasizing importance of transparency in both models and underlying technologies.
