## Abstract

The present report builds on UNESCO’s previous work on gender equality and AI and aims to continue the conversation on this topic with a select group of experts from key stakeholder groups. In March 2019, UNESCO published a groundbreaking report, I’d Blush if I Could: closing gender divides in digital skills through education, based on research funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development. This report featured recommendations on actions to overcome global gender gaps in digital skills, with a special examination of the impact of gender biases coded into some of the most prevalent AI applications.
