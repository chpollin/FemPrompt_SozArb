## Abstract

Interdisciplinary analysis examining algorithmic management as sociotechnical phenomenon shaped by organizational choices and power structures rather than technological determinism. Authors critically analyze how algorithmic systems in standard work settings redefine pre-existing power dynamics between workers and managers, demanding new competencies while fostering oppositional attitudes. Key critical insights include risk of treating workers as programmable cogs through automation, commodification and alienation in digitally-mediated work, and elimination of middle management functions. Challenges simplified narratives of algorithmic replacement, demonstrating how algorithms emerge through continuous interaction between organizational members and systems. Critical concerns include deskilling, surveillance, loss of discretion, and embedding of managerial control in opaque technical systems.
