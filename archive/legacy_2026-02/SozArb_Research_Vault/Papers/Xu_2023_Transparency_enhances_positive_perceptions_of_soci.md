## Abstract

Experimental study with 914 participants testing how transparent explanations about chatbot workings affect user perceptions. Results show transparency modestly improved trust-related perceptions: users found chatbot "less creepy," felt more affinity, and perceived it as more socially intelligent when transparent explanation provided. Transparency's impact on perceived intelligence stronger for users with low prior AI knowledge. Suggests prompt-engineering for greater transparency can foster user comfort and trust.
