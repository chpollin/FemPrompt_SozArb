## Abstract

This philosophical paper argues that the pursuit of "explainability" in AI is too narrow. It proposes a richer ideal called "systematicity," which demands that an AI's reasoning be consistent, coherent, comprehensive, and principled, akin to an integrated body of human thought. The author distinguishes this "hard systematicity challenge" from the historical Fodorian debate on connectionism and explores how the demand for AI to be systematic should be regulated by different rationales.
