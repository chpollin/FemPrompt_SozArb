## Abstract

Empirical qualitative study exploring patient perspectives on AI-based clinical decision support systems (AI-CDSS) in healthcare, revealing significant ambivalence about AI use in medical decision-making. Through interviews examining trust, responsibility distribution, and self-determination when AI systems assist physicians, findings show patients worry about decreased human interaction, loss of holistic care perspectives, and unclear accountability when AI makes errors. Vulnerable populations express particular concerns about algorithmic systems making decisions affecting their wellbeing.
