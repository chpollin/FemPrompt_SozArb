## Abstract

This work presents hermeneutic reverse engineering as a framework for investigating bias in AI systems. The approach considers AI systems as boundary objects and analyzes cultural meanings and assumptions embedded in techno-cultural objects. The study proposes three research perspectives: (1) comparative exploration of algorithmic bias, (2) investigation of impacts on various social groups, and (3) participatory approaches to include users in AI design.
