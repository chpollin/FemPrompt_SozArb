## Abstract

BASW's initial practice guidance specifically addressing generative AI use in social work, offering reflection points for practitioners relating to ethical considerations under BASW Code of Ethics. Warns that AI tools are prone to replicating racist/sexist assumptions from training datasets, generating misleading information (hallucinations), and risking data privacy breaches. Emphasizes generative AI should create capacity for relationship-based practice rather than justify increased caseloads or redundancies. Key recommendations include avoiding entry of sensitive personal information into generic tools without explicit consent, conducting data protection assessments, maintaining human oversight and critical assessment of AI outputs.
