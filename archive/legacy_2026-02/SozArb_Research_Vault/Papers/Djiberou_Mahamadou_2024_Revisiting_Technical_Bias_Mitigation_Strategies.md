## Abstract

Diese systematische Überprüfung identifiziert praktische Limitationen technischer Bias-Mitigation-Strategien im Gesundheitswesen entlang fünf Schlüsseldimensionen: wer Bias und Fairness definiert, welche Mitigation-Strategie zu verwenden und zu priorisieren ist, wann in den KI-Entwicklungsstadien die Lösungen am effektivsten sind, für welche Populationen und in welchem Kontext die Lösungen entworfen sind. Die Studie zeigt mathematische Inkonsistenzen und Inkompatibilitäten zwischen verschiedenen Fairness-Metriken auf und diskutiert, wie werteorientierte KI stakeholder-bezogene Ansätze zur Bias-Mitigation ermöglichen kann.


## AI Summary

## Overview

This Stanford-based review systematically examines why technical approaches to bias mitigation in healthcare AI frequently fail in real-world implementation despite their theoretical soundness. The authors conduct a critical analysis of practical limitations inherent in current bias mitigation strategies, departing from the dominant engineering-centric paradigm by arguing that bias and fairness are fundamentally socio-technical challenges requiring stakeholder engagement and contextual sensitivity. The review is structured around five critical dimensions determining implementation success: (1) who defines bias and fairness, (2) which mitigation strategies to prioritize among incompatible alternatives, (3) when interventions should occur in the development pipeline, (4) which populations benefit from specific solutions, and (5) the broader organizational and clinical contexts shaping deployment. The work is particularly urgent given healthcare's high stakes—where algorithmic errors have life-or-death consequences—and the potential for AI to either reduce or exacerbate existing health inequities, especially in low-resource settings.

## Main Findings

The authors identify critical implementation gaps that technical solutions alone cannot address. First, bias operates through compounding mechanisms where data biases, algorithmic biases (minority bias, label bias), and user-interaction biases (clinician and patient biases) interact synergistically, creating detection and mitigation challenges exceeding technical scope. Second, regulatory frameworks—including federal civil rights laws—struggle to establish causality between algorithmic decisions and patient harm, creating legal ambiguity that undermines enforcement and accountability. Third, the proliferation of incompatible and inconsistent mitigation strategies lacks clear prioritization mechanisms, forcing practitioners to make ad-hoc choices without principled guidance. Fourth, the effectiveness of bias mitigation strategies varies unpredictably across different patient populations and healthcare contexts, suggesting universal technical solutions are inappropriate. Fifth, current technical approaches systematically exclude stakeholder values—those of patients, clinicians, and affected communities—from solution design. Finally, the review identifies that despite AI's demonstrated superiority in medical imaging and other applications, and its substantial economic potential, these advances risk amplifying health inequities without proper governance frameworks.

## Methodology/Approach

The review employs structured dimensional analysis examining five implementation factors across empirical healthcare case studies rather than theoretical abstraction. The theoretical framework integrates value-sensitive design—a technology ethics approach emphasizing stakeholder participation—as a corrective to purely technical perspectives. This methodological choice represents a deliberate shift from engineering-centric to socio-technical analysis. The authors ground arguments in concrete biomedical applications, demonstrating how technical solutions fail in practice. The review also examines how algorithmic anti-discrimination laws and AI regulation initiatives attempt to address bias but remain insufficient without addressing underlying implementation challenges.

## Relevant Concepts

**Technical Solutionism**: The assumption that complex social problems can be resolved through technical interventions alone, without addressing underlying value conflicts or contextual factors.

**Value-Sensitive Design**: A framework ensuring that stakeholder values are systematically incorporated into technology design processes, moving beyond purely functional considerations.

**Compounding Bias**: The synergistic interaction of multiple bias sources (data biases, algorithmic biases, user-interaction biases) that amplifies discriminatory effects beyond individual components.

**Health Inequities**: Systematic disparities in health outcomes across populations, which AI systems can either mitigate or exacerbate through biased decision-making.

**Socio-Technical Systems**: Integrated frameworks recognizing that technology implementation depends equally on social, organizational, and institutional factors alongside technical capabilities.

**Algorithmic Anti-Discrimination**: Legal and regulatory approaches attempting to prevent AI systems from systematically discriminating against protected groups.

## Significance

This work challenges the prevailing assumption that bias mitigation is primarily an engineering problem, reframing it as a governance and values challenge requiring stakeholder engagement. By positioning healthcare as a critical test case with life-or-death stakes, the authors demonstrate that high-stakes domains require fundamentally different approaches than general AI applications. The emphasis on the five implementation dimensions provides practitioners with structured frameworks for identifying where technical solutions fail. The review's significance lies in bridging technical AI ethics literature with social science critiques, offering healthcare institutions evidence-based rationales for integrating value-sensitive frameworks into bias mitigation strategies. The work also highlights the particular urgency for low-resource settings where AI deployment could either democratize healthcare access or perpetuate existing inequities. By providing practical recommendations alongside theoretical critique, the review positions itself as actionable guidance for healthcare organizations, regulators, and AI developers navigating the complex landscape of fairness implementation.
