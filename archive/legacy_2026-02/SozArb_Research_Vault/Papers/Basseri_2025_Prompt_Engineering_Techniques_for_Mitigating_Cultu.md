## Abstract

This systematic review identifies five major prompt engineering strategies to reduce cultural and intersectional bias in LLMs. Structured multi-step pipelines were most effective but complex, while cultural prompting offered a practical balance. Results show varying mitigation success depending on stereotype type, and emphasize trade-offs between bias reduction and performance.
