## Abstract

This study introduces multilingual prompting as a strategy to enhance narrative diversity in LLM outputs. By using prompts with diverse languages and cultural cues, models produced outputs with improved demographic and opinion diversity. Compared to temperature-based and persona prompting, multilingual prompting was more effective and reduced cultural hallucinations.
