## Abstract

Investigates how biased or prejudiced content in LLM responses affects user trust and willingness to use the system, particularly for users from marginalized communities. Through three preregistered experiments, finds that when AI responses exhibited prejudice, participants from marginalized groups reported significantly lower trust and decreased intentions to continue using the system.
