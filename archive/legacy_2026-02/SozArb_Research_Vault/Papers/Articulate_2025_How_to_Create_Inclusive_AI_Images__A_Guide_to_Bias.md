## Abstract

Practical guide examining prompt engineering strategies for creating inclusive AI-generated images and avoiding biased default outputs. Analysis shows AI image generators often produce stereotypical representations (white, male, slim, young, physically able) due to training on unbalanced internet datasets. Presents concrete techniques for inclusive prompt engineering: specifying visible identity characteristics (age, race, gender, body size, visible disabilities), using diversity-promoting terms like "multicultural" and "gender-diverse," and providing additional context to break stereotypical associations.
