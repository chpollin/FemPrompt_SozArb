## Abstract

Comprehensive examination of AI-based decision support systems across healthcare, legal systems, and border control. Provides critical analysis of technical, ethical, legal, and societal challenges when machines make or support decisions previously made by humans. Reviews regulatory attempts including EU AI Act. Examines key issues: opacity of algorithmic systems creating black box problems for accountability, professional deskilling risks when practitioners defer to AI, and potential for discrimination embedded in training data and algorithmic logic.
