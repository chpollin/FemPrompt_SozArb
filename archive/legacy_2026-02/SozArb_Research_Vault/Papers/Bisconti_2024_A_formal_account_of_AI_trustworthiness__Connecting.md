## Abstract

Develops formal conceptualization of AI trustworthiness connecting intrinsic and perceived trustworthiness in operationalizable schema. Argues that trustworthiness extends beyond inherent AI system capabilities to include significant influences from observer perceptions such as perceived transparency, agency locus, and human oversight. Identifies three central perceived characteristics: transparency (access to information about functionality), agency locus (perception of action autonomy source), and human oversight (presence of human control). Mathematical formalization defines overall trustworthiness as function of discrepancy between intrinsic and perceived trustworthiness.
