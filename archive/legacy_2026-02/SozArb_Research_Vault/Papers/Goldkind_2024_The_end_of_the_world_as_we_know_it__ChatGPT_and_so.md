## Abstract

Editorial in flagship journal Social Work providing critical reflection on ChatGPT's introduction and implications for social work practice. Addresses how ChatGPT, built on natural language processing, responds to prompts and generates text responses. Notes social work's historical reluctance to embrace new technologies and positions ChatGPT as opportunity to reflect on strategies promoting just technology use. Urges social workers to join cross-disciplinary conversations about AI evolution and advocate for fair use. Calls for profession to move beyond fear and awe toward critical, reflective engagement with AI systems through thoughtful prompting practices.
