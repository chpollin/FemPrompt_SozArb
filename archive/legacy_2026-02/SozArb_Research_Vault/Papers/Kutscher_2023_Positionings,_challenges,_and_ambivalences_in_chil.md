## Abstract

Examines family dynamics in digitalized contexts, analyzing tensions between children's digital participation rights and parental protection responsibilities. Presents research revealing ambivalences in both parental and children's perspectives: parents struggle between enabling children's digital competence and protecting them from risks; children experience tension between desire for autonomy and need for guidance. Addresses sharenting (parents sharing children's images/information online), examining conflicts between parental expression rights and children's privacy rights.
