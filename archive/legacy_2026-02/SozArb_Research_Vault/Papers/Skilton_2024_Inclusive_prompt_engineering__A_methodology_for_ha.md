## Abstract

This conference paper introduces "inclusive prompt engineering" as a strategy to probe and mitigate biases in generative AI image systems. Authors developed methodology to systematically modify prompts and provide tools for generating more diverse outputs. User studies revealed that when participants encountered stereotypical outputs, they tried adding negative qualifiers but models often failed to obey these negations. Findings underscore need for improved prompt interfaces that actively promote inclusive representation.
