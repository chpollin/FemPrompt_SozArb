## Abstract

Systematic review examining how researchers address ethics, equity, bias, and model performance in predictive and prescriptive algorithms used in child welfare settings. Analyzing 67 articles published 2010-2020, reveals inconsistent approaches to measuring and mitigating algorithmic fairness in child welfare applications. Identifies that most predictive models use administrative data reflecting surveillance biases rather than true child maltreatment incidence, leading to discrimination against low-income families and communities of color. Highlights many tools fail to address how automation bias and dehumanization affect social workers' professional judgment.
