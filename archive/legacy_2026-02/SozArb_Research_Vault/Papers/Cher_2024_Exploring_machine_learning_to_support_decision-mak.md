## Abstract

Statewide study analyzed 12,621 child welfare cases in large Midwestern state (2017-2020) to develop machine learning models predicting placement disruption risk. Goal was to identify youth who could benefit from placement stabilization services to prevent unnecessary residential care under Family First Prevention Services Act. Random forest models were compared with conventional logistic regression for predicting placement disruption and referral to stabilization programs. ML models demonstrated moderate predictive validity with practical implications for proactive service allocation. Results showed ML could support but not replace caseworker judgment in placement decisions. Study used administrative child welfare data and evaluated model fairness considerations.
