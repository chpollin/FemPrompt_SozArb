## Abstract

Purpose This narrative review investigates the interplay between gender bias in artificial intelligence (AI) systems and the potential of digital literacy to empower women in technology. By synthesising research from 2010 to 2024, the study examines how gender bias manifests in AI, its impact on women’s participation in technology, and the effectiveness of digital literacy initiatives in addressing these disparities. Methods A systematic literature search was conducted across major academic databases, including Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, and Google Scholar. The review focused on peer-reviewed articles, reports, and case studies published between 2010 and 2024 that addressed gender bias in AI, women’s participation in technology, and digital literacy initiatives. A thematic analysis framework was employed to identify and synthesise recurring themes and patterns. Results The findings reveal systemic gender biases embedded in AI applications across diverse domains, such as recruitment, healthcare, and financial services. These biases stem from factors including the under-representation of women in AI development teams, biased training datasets, and algorithmic design choices. Digital literacy programs emerge as a promising intervention, fostering a critical awareness of AI bias, encouraging women to pursue AI careers, and catalysing growth in women-led AI projects. Conclusions Although gender bias in AI poses significant challenges, this review highlights digital literacy as a transformative tool for achieving gender equity in AI development and application. The study highlights the importance of inclusive AI design, gender-responsive education policies, and sustained research efforts to mitigate bias and promote equity.


## AI Summary

## Overview

This narrative review, published in January 2025, examines the intersection of gender bias in artificial intelligence systems and digital literacy as a mechanism for women's empowerment in technology sectors. Authored by Syed Sibghatullah Shah from Quaid-i-Azam University, the study synthesizes peer-reviewed research from 2010-2024 to understand how gender discrimination manifests within AI technologies and explores whether educational interventions through digital literacy can effectively mitigate these disparities. The research addresses a critical contemporary challenge: as AI systems increasingly influence consequential decisions across recruitment, healthcare, and financial services, embedded gender biases perpetuate systemic discrimination. The document positions digital literacy as a transformative intervention capable of fostering critical awareness of AI bias, encouraging women's participation in AI development careers, and catalyzing growth in women-led AI projects.

## Main Findings

The review identifies systemic gender biases as pervasive across multiple AI application domains, particularly recruitment, healthcare, and financial services. These biases originate from three interconnected causative factors: (1) underrepresentation of women in AI development teams creates homogeneous perspectives during system design; (2) biased training datasets—often reflecting historical discrimination—perpetuate inequitable algorithmic outcomes; and (3) algorithmic design choices frequently fail to account for gender-specific impacts. Digital literacy programs emerge as promising interventions accomplishing multiple objectives: cultivating critical awareness of how AI systems embed and amplify gender bias; encouraging women to pursue careers in AI development; and supporting growth of women-led AI projects. The findings suggest digital literacy functions dually as a defensive mechanism (enabling women to recognize and critique biased systems) and an offensive strategy (empowering women to become creators of equitable AI solutions). However, the review acknowledges limited empirical evidence demonstrating measurable effectiveness of specific digital literacy interventions.

## Methodology/Approach

The study employs a narrative review methodology, conducting systematic literature searches across major academic databases (Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, Google Scholar) covering 2010-2024. The analytical framework utilizes thematic analysis to identify and synthesize recurring patterns across peer-reviewed articles, reports, and case studies. The document was commissioned and underwent external peer review. However, the methodology exhibits significant limitations: it lacks explicit inclusion/exclusion criteria, quality assessment protocols, bias mitigation strategies, and quantitative synthesis methods typical of rigorous systematic reviews. These constraints limit evidence precision, may introduce selection bias, and restrict suitability for meta-analysis or automated systematic analysis.

## Relevant Concepts

**Gender Bias in AI:** Systematic discrimination embedded in algorithmic systems that disadvantages individuals based on gender, manifesting through biased training data, flawed design assumptions, or homogeneous development teams.

**Digital Literacy:** Critical understanding of how digital technologies function, their societal implications, and capacity to engage meaningfully with technological systems—extending beyond basic technical skills.

**Women's Technological Participation:** Women's representation and active engagement in AI development, deployment, and decision-making roles across technology sectors.

**Inclusive AI Design:** Development processes intentionally incorporating diverse perspectives, particularly from underrepresented groups, to identify and mitigate potential biases before deployment.

**Gender-Responsive Education Policies:** Educational frameworks explicitly designed to address gender-specific barriers and promote equitable access to technology education and careers.

**AI Workforce Diversity:** Representation of women and other underrepresented groups across all levels of AI development, from entry-level positions to leadership roles.

## Significance

This review contributes to AI ethics literature by bridging technical bias scholarship with educational intervention research. It advances policy discourse by proposing digital literacy as a multifaceted solution addressing both individual empowerment and systemic change. The work emphasizes that achieving gender equity in AI requires simultaneous interventions: inclusive AI design, gender-responsive educational policies, AI workforce diversity initiatives, and sustained research efforts. The author's position is explicitly advocacy-oriented within the scientific discourse on algorithmic fairness. However, critical limitations constrain impact: the narrative methodology provides limited empirical evidence regarding digital literacy's measurable effectiveness, lacks specific implementation frameworks, and offers no quantitative outcomes demonstrating concrete impact on women's AI participation or bias mitigation. Future research should provide longitudinal studies, measurable outcome data, and comparative analysis of different digital literacy intervention models to strengthen evidence-based policymaking in this domain.
