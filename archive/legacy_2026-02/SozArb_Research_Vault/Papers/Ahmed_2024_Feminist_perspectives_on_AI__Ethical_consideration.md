## Abstract

Explores ethical implications of algorithmic decision-making from feminist perspective, examining data bias, discrimination in automated systems, and underrepresentation of women in AI development. Algorithmic biases disproportionately affect marginalized groups and reinforce societal inequalities in areas like hiring, healthcare, and law enforcement. Feminist ethical framework emphasizes transparency, fairness, and inclusivity while questioning patriarchal and corporate-driven narratives in AI research and policy. Analysis shows AI ethics must go beyond technical solutions to address systemic power imbalances and cultural biases in data.
