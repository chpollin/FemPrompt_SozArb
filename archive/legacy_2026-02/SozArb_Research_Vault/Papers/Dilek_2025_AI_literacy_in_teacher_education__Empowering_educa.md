## Abstract

Implements critical co-discovery approaches within AI teacher education to move beyond technical automation toward critical pedagogical engagement. Through co-discovery activities, educators developed understanding of AI concepts, ethical considerations, and context-specific applications while co-constructing knowledge. Emphasizes that prolonged engagement with AI literacy integrated into teacher education programs enables educators to critically navigate AI systems and examine broader pedagogical and ethical implications, prioritizing critical examination of AI's power dynamics and social justice implications.
