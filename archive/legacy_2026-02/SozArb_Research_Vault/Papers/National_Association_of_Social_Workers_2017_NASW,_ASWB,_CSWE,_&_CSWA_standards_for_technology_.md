## Abstract

Landmark 64-page collaborative document representing unprecedented coordination among four major U.S. social work organizations to establish comprehensive technology standards for the profession. Standards address four main areas: providing information to public, designing and delivering services, gathering/managing/storing/accessing client information, and educating and supervising social workers. Covers practitioner competence, informed consent, privacy and confidentiality, boundaries and dual relationships, records and documentation, collegial relationships, and jurisdictional boundaries. Provides foundational ethical guidance directly applicable to AI technologies.
