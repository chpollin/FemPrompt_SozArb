## Abstract

Through interviews with AI practitioners interpreted via feminist political thought, reimagines responsibility in AI development beyond individualized approaches. Critiques current AI responsibility frameworks focused on individual competency and technical solutions, proposing instead "responsibility as the product of work cultures that enable tech workers to be responsive and answerable for their products." Moves beyond "individual competency approaches" toward understanding responsibility as embedded in structural power relations and organizational cultures.
