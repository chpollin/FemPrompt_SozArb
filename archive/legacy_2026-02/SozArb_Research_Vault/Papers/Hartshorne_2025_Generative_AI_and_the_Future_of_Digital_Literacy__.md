## Abstract

Examines generative AI potential for promoting female inclusion in primary and secondary education while addressing inherent risks of reinforcing gender-specific biases. Qualitative research analyzes systemic effects of generative AI tools on teaching and learning through interviews and focus groups with students and teachers. Results show complex interactions between generative AI technologies and gender dynamics. Key factors for effective AI-supported learning environments include personalized learning experiences, bias-aware content generation, and teachers' role as mediators of AI interactions.
