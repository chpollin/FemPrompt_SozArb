## Abstract

Develops "disruptive-disrupting" framework for analyzing generative AI in social work research with concrete recommendations for researchers and journal editors. Emphasizes transparency and accountability requiring researchers to fully document AI use, disclose prompts, and take responsibility for AI-generated content. Argues that continuous education about AI construction, limitations, and ethical considerations is essential for developing appropriate trust in LLM systems.
