## Abstract

Raji and Buolamwini, pioneers of algorithmic auditing, argue for an approach rooted in social justice. They critique audits that focus solely on technical metrics, advocating instead for methods that center the lived experiences of marginalized communities. This involves a multi-stakeholder process, transparency, and a focus on real-world harms. Such an audit practice inherently makes the co-constitution of discrimination visible by investigating not just the algorithm's output, but the entire socio-technical system in which it is embedded. The paper implicitly highlights the limits of individual competence (e.g., a single auditor's skill) by emphasizing the need for collective, community-involved processes to challenge structural power.
