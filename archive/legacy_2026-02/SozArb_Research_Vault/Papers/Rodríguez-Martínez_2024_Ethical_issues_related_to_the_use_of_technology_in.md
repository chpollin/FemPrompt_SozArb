## Abstract

Systematic literature review examining ethical tensions arising from technology integration in social work practice. Review identifies three main categories of ethical challenges: effects of digitization on professional practice (tensions between efficiency and human connection), education, research and engagement challenges (digital literacy requirements conflicting with traditional social work training), and ethical challenges in digital professional practice (boundary issues, dual relationships, informed consent in digital contexts). Key value conflicts include technology's potential to erode professional relationships and trust; digital divide creating social justice concerns; automated systems undermining client self-determination and participation; and privacy violations threatening human dignity.
