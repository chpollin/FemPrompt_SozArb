## Abstract

Large-scale empirical study using over 550 resumes and 3+ million comparisons reveals that intersectional patterns of bias in AI resume screening cannot be understood as additive combinations of single-axis discrimination. Discovered unique harm against Black men invisible when examining race or gender independently—Black male names were never preferred over white male names (0% selection rate). Demonstrates co-constitutive nature of multiple discrimination where intersection of Blackness and masculinity creates distinct exclusion patterns.
