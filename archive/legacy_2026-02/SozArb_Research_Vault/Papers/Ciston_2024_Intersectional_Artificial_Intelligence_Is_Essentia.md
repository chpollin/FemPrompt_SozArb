## Abstract

Arguments for applying intersectional strategies to AI at all levels - from data through design to implementation. Intersectionality, integrating institutional power analysis and queer-feminist plus critical race theories, can contribute to AI reconceptualization. Intersectional framework enables analysis of existing AI biases and uncovering alternative ethics from counter-narratives. Research presents intersectional strategies as polyvocal, multimodal, and experimental, with community-focused and artistic practices helping explore AI's intersectional possibilities. Practical examples include Data Nutrition Label for bias assessment in datasets and experimental projects like "ladymouth," a chatbot explaining feminism.
