## Abstract

Demonstrates that even when LLMs are aligned to avoid overt bias, they can still harbor implicit biases. Introduces novel evaluation methods inspired by psychology: LLM Word Association Test (LLM-WAT) and LLM Relative Decision Test (LLM-RDT) to probe automatic associations and subtle discrimination. Finds pervasive stereotype-consistent biases across multiple domains in eight state-of-the-art, value-aligned models.
