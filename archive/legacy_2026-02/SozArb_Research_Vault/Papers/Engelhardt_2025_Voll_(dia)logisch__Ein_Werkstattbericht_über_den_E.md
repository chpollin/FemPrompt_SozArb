## Abstract

Werkstattbericht zur curricularen Integration generativer KI. Positioniert Prompting als metakognitive Schlüsselkompetenz und diskutiert Rollenwandel von Lehr-/Lernakteuren; fordert reflektierte, ethisch eingebettete Nutzung mit Fokus auf kritische Validierung von KI-Ergebnissen.


## AI Summary

## Overview

Engelhardt and Ley's chapter addresses the critical challenge of integrating generative AI into social work higher education while maintaining academic integrity and critical thinking. Published in a 2025 edited volume on digitalization in social work education, this work is explicitly framed as a "Werkstattbericht" (workshop report)—a methodological choice emphasizing exploratory, practice-based inquiry rather than definitive conclusions. The authors position themselves as "learning teachers" actively experimenting with AI technologies in their own pedagogical contexts. The chapter's title—"Voll (dia)logisch?" (Fully Dialogical?)—signals concern with preserving dialogical, relational dimensions of social work education amid technological transformation. The work deliberately transcends simplistic benefit-risk dichotomies to examine AI's transformative implications for curriculum design, pedagogical practice, and the reconstituted roles of educators and learners.

## Main Findings

The authors identify several critical insights grounded in three concrete application scenarios. First, **academic writing assistance** demonstrates AI's potential to support student composition while requiring explicit safeguards against plagiarism and passive dependency. Second, **methodological practice partnerships** position AI as a sparring partner for developing social work skills (interviewing, case analysis, ethical reasoning), enriching pedagogical diversity. Third, **chatbots as productive environments** enable students to engage with complex scenarios and receive immediate feedback, supporting experiential learning. Across these scenarios, the authors conclude that generative AI presents genuine pedagogical opportunities when thoughtfully implemented. However, successful integration demands explicit institutional attention to academic honesty, cultivation of critical analytical competencies, and reconceptualization of teacher-student roles. The authors argue that polarized opportunity-risk framings inadequately capture AI's transformative implications, advocating sophisticated integration strategies that acknowledge disciplinary values—particularly social work's emphasis on relational practice, ethical judgment, and reflective practice.

## Methodology/Approach

The document employs qualitative, exploratory methodology characteristic of workshop reports. Rather than formal hypothesis testing, the authors adopt reflective, practice-based research grounded in their own pedagogical experimentation since November 2022 (coinciding with GPT-3.5's public release). This reflexive stance—positioning researchers as active participants in iterative learning processes—legitimizes preliminary findings while transparently acknowledging knowledge limitations. The methodology appropriately reflects the provisional nature of conclusions given rapid technological development. This approach models scholarly caution necessary when premature claims risk obsolescence, while demonstrating commitment to evidence-informed practice.

## Relevant Concepts

**Generative AI**: Artificial intelligence systems creating new content based on learned patterns; exemplified by large language models like GPT-3.5, capable of text generation, analysis, and dialogue.

**Werkstattbericht (Workshop Report)**: Methodological approach emphasizing exploratory, practice-based inquiry with provisional conclusions rather than definitive findings.

**Dialogical Pedagogy**: Educational approach emphasizing relational interaction, dialogue, and co-construction of knowledge—particularly valued in social work education.

**Academic Integrity**: Ethical standards ensuring honest intellectual work; threatened when AI tools obscure authorship and original thinking.

**Actor Constellations**: Changing relationships and roles between educators, learners, and technological systems within educational environments.

**Curricular Transformation**: Fundamental redesign of educational programs accommodating new technologies while preserving disciplinary values and learning objectives.

**Critical Thinking**: Analytical and evaluative capacities essential to social work practice, requiring explicit protection amid AI integration.

## Significance

This work occupies strategic importance in AI-in-education discourse by providing discipline-specific, pragmatic analysis grounded in concrete pedagogical scenarios. The chapter addresses a significant gap in social work education literature while contributing to broader conversations about AI literacy and curricular transformation. For social work educators, it provides conceptual frameworks and practical application scenarios for thoughtful implementation. The authors' commitment to moving beyond polarized debates while preserving dialogical, relational dimensions of social work education establishes a scholarly model for responsible AI integration in professional disciplines. The reflexive methodology and emphasis on transformative rather than merely additive change positions this work as important guidance for educators navigating rapid technological change while maintaining disciplinary integrity.
