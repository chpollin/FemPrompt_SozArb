## Abstract

Empirical study examining how child maltreatment hotline workers interact with Allegheny Family Screening Tool, an AI-based decision support system. Through interviews and contextual inquiries, found workers' reliance on algorithmic predictions guided by four key factors: knowledge of contextual information beyond AI model capabilities, beliefs about system limitations, organizational pressures around tool use, and awareness of misalignments between algorithmic predictions and their own decision-making objectives. Reveals discrimination risks stemming from workers lacking adequate training on tool's data sources and limitations.
