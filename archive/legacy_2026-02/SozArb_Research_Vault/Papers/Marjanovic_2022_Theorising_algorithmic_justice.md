## Abstract

Theoretical article developing framework for understanding algorithmic justice in automated decision-making systems with specific application to social welfare services. Authors examine how AI-driven automated algorithmic decision-making threatens core social justice principles in transformative services like welfare. Framework addresses WHAT matters in algorithmic justice (fairness, equity, human rights), WHO counts as subjects (vulnerable populations disproportionately affected), and HOW algorithmic justice is performed (through transparent, accountable, participatory processes). Key ethical tensions identified include datafication reducing humans to data points violating dignity; technological inscribing embedding biases perpetuating discrimination; systemic nature of injustices compounding disadvantage for marginalized groups; and loss of human judgment and participation.
