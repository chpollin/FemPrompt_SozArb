## Abstract

Empirical study examining how users' beliefs about LLM's "mind" affect trust in advice. Preregistered experiment (N=410) showing attributing intelligence to LLM strongly increased trust, whereas attributing human-like consciousness did not increase trust. Higher ascriptions of sentience correlated with less advice-taking. Participants trusted AI for perceived analytical competence, not for having feelings. Suggests prompt-engineering highlighting competence and reliability more effective than anthropomorphism for building appropriate trust.
