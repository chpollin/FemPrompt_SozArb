## Abstract

This systematic review of 8 studies (2021–2024) identifies five prompt engineering approaches to mitigate bias against Arabs and Muslims: self-debiasing, cultural context prompting, affective priming, structured multi-step pipelines, and continuous prompt tuning. Multi-step pipelines were most effective, reducing biased content by up to ~88%, while simpler methods like cultural prompts showed ~71–81% improvement. The review concludes that while prompt engineering can mitigate biases without retraining, deep-seated biases may persist, and fixes can be superficial.
