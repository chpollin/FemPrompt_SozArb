## Abstract

Comprehensive synthesis of Latin American women's conversations developing AI under feminist frameworks establishes methodological commitments for co-design with communities, gender perspective integration in data science projects, and strategies for women crowd workers. Key feminist AI principles include building diverse intersectional teams, establishing community collaboration agreements, choosing technology based on context rather than consumption, and protecting autonomy through strong anonymity criteria.
