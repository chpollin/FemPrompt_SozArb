## Abstract

Study developing "Trust-In-LLMs Index (TILLMI)" psychometric scale to quantify trust in conversational AI. Survey of ~1,000 U.S. adults identified two trust dimensions: affective component (emotional closeness) and cognitive component (reliance on competence). Found significant individual differences with personality factors influencing trust. Prior LLM experience increased trust while those with no direct use were more skeptical. Highlights need for prompt-engineering and system design to account for user differences.
