## Abstract

Special issue introduction providing critical sociological analysis of digital welfare state, examining how datafication and automation amplify existing trends of surveillance and control over marginalized populations. Authors argue that contrary to neutral efficiency narratives, digital welfare technologies are embedded in fiscal austerity politics and criminalization of poverty. Employs power relations and human agency frameworks to demonstrate how algorithmic systems increase scrutiny of welfare recipients, migrants, and undeserving populations while prioritizing cost-cutting over meeting social needs. Critiques framing of AI as unprecedented innovation, situating digital welfare within historical dynamics of social control. Key themes include erosion of professional discretion, surveillance assemblages, and automated decision-making reproducing structural inequalities.
