## Abstract

Empirical study examining gender bias in large language models through analysis of over 6000 evaluated student responses from 70 male and 70 female participants. Research uses fine-tuned BERT models and GPT-3.5 to evaluate various training data configurations: gender-specific versus mixed datasets. Three evaluation metrics applied: Scoring Accuracy Difference for bias assessment, Mean Score Gaps (MSG) for gender disparities, and Equalized Odds (EO) for fairness measurement. Results show mixed-gender trained models produce significantly better results than gender-specific models with reduced MSG and fairer predictions.
