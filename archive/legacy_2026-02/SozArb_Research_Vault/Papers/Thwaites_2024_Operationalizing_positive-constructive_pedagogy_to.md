## Abstract

This article proposes the "3E model" (Expose, Explore, Exploit) as a pedagogical framework for developing critical AI literacy. The model aims to move students beyond passive use of AI to a more critical engagement. The "Expose" phase involves revealing the underlying mechanisms and biases of AI systems. "Explore" encourages students to test AI boundaries and critically question its outputs, a practice akin to critical prompting. "Exploit" focuses on using AI for creative and novel purposes. While not explicitly feminist, the framework provides a practical method for developing the critical literacies needed to identify and question the co-constitution of discrimination in AI outputs, thereby making biases visible.
