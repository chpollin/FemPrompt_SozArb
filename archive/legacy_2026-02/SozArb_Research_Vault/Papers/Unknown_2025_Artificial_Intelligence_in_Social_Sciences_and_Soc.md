## Abstract

This review explores the transformative role of artificial intelligence (AI) in the fields of social sciences and social work, with a focus on developments from 2022 to 2025. It examines how AI technologies—such as machine learning, natural language processing—enhance the analysis of complex social phenomena, support real-time forecasting, and inform data-driven policymaking. Within social work and human services, AI-driven tools facilitate case management, mental health interventions, crisis response, and resource allocation. While acknowledging AI's potential to improve equity and access, the article critically engages with ethical concerns around algorithmic bias, privacy, surveillance, and the erosion of human-centered care. Drawing on recent policy frameworks like the EU AI Act and UNESCO's AI Ethics Guidelines, the review calls for interdisciplinary collaboration to ensure the ethical, inclusive, and accountable integration of AI in social contexts.


## AI Summary

## Overview

This academic review examines the transformative integration of artificial intelligence technologies into social sciences and human services during 2022-2025. The document addresses a critical contemporary question: how can AI be ethically implemented across research methodologies, policy-making, and service delivery while protecting human dignity and advancing social justice? Authored by Reji TR (PhD Scholar, Madurai Kamaraj University), the review adopts a balanced, critical-pragmatic stance that neither dismisses AI's potential nor uncritically embraces technological solutions. By synthesizing recent scholarship across computer science, social work, policy analysis, and ethics, the author positions AI integration as an inevitable but governance-dependent development requiring interdisciplinary collaboration and robust ethical frameworks.

## Main Findings

The review identifies substantial AI applications across multiple social science disciplines and human services contexts. **Research methodology applications** include machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) for analyzing complex social phenomena, AI-driven simulations and digital twin models for real-time policy impact assessment, and automated literature synthesis and intelligent peer-review systems that enhance research integrity by reducing human bias. **Policy and forecasting applications** enable real-time trend forecasting and data-driven policymaking in sociology, political science, economics, and anthropology.

**Human services applications** demonstrate concrete benefits: automated case management systems improve resource allocation efficiency, risk assessment algorithms identify vulnerable populations at scale, mental health chatbots and NLP-enabled crisis intervention tools expand therapeutic capacity, and emerging technologies (blockchain, virtual reality, AI-powered virtual assistants) expand social support infrastructure.

However, significant implementation challenges accompany these opportunities. Algorithmic bias threatens equitable service delivery, privacy violations undermine client confidentiality, surveillance capabilities create dystopian risks, and automation risks eroding human-centered care—the foundational principle of social work practice. The review concludes that ethical integration requires interdisciplinary collaboration, adherence to policy frameworks (EU AI Act, UNESCO AI Ethics Guidelines), sustained commitment to human dignity principles, and future research prioritizing socially responsible AI applications.

## Methodology/Approach

This narrative literature review synthesizes recent scholarship (2022-2025) through an explicitly interdisciplinary framework combining: computer science and AI ethics literature, social science research methodology, social work practice literature, and policy analysis. The analytical approach deliberately balances technological optimism with critical ethical examination, adopting a "socially responsible AI lens" that prioritizes human dignity and social justice. This framework acknowledges both AI's transformative potential and legitimate concerns about uncritical adoption, positioning the review within contemporary academic consensus that AI governance requires simultaneous technological advancement and ethical caution. The review explicitly bridges technical AI discourse with social science concerns, connecting abstract policy frameworks with practice-level implementation challenges.

## Relevant Concepts

**Algorithmic Bias:** Systematic errors in AI decision-making that disproportionately disadvantage specific populations, particularly vulnerable groups in social services contexts.

**Natural Language Processing (NLP):** AI technology enabling machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language, applied to crisis intervention, literature analysis, and peer-review processes.

**Predictive Analytics:** AI-driven forecasting techniques analyzing historical data to anticipate social and economic trends, enabling proactive policy interventions and resource allocation.

**Digital Twin Models:** AI-driven simulations replicating complex social dynamics, enabling real-time assessment of policy changes before implementation.

**Human-Centered Care:** Social work's foundational principle emphasizing individual dignity, autonomy, and relational engagement—potentially threatened by automation and algorithmic decision-making.

**Socially Responsible AI:** AI development and deployment prioritizing ethical considerations, equity, transparency, and accountability alongside technical performance metrics.

**Critical-Pragmatic Positioning:** Analytical stance acknowledging technological potential while maintaining skepticism about uncritical adoption, balancing innovation with ethical accountability.

## Significance

This review addresses a critical gap in academic discourse by systematically examining AI's role in social contexts rather than purely technical applications. Its significance lies in: (1) bridging technical AI literature with social science concerns, (2) connecting policy frameworks with practice-level implementation challenges, (3) articulating how human-centered values can guide technological advancement, and (4) establishing that technological progress and ethical accountability are interdependent rather than competing imperatives. By emphasizing social justice and human dignity, the work aligns with critical social work traditions while engaging pragmatically with technological realities. The review provides essential guidance for practitioners, policymakers, and researchers navigating AI integration, establishing future research directions aimed at fostering socially responsible AI applications. Its critical-pragmatic positioning reflects emerging academic consensus that neither technophobic rejection nor uncritical enthusiasm serves social welfare objectives.
