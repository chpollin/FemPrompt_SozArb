## Abstract

Empirical study investigating German social workers' perspectives on decision support systems in disability services through practitioner interviews. Identifies both opportunities (consistency across cases, evidence-based practice, administrative time-saving) and significant risks (deprofessionalization, data protection concerns, reduced professional autonomy, loss of holistic assessment capabilities). Social workers express ambivalence: recognizing potential for reducing subjective bias and improving resource allocation transparency while worrying about losing relational aspects of assessment and client trust.
