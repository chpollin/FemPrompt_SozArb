## Abstract

This study uses NLP and machine learning to analyze 172,041 tweets from female users discussing gender inequality in AI. It identifies prominent themes including the future of AI technologies and women's active role in ensuring gender-balanced systems. Findings show that algorithmic bias directly affects women's experiences, prompting engagement in online discourse about injustices. Women lead constructive conversations and create entrepreneurial solutions when faced with bias, demonstrating how feminist digital literacies can make AI biases visible and push for their reduction.
