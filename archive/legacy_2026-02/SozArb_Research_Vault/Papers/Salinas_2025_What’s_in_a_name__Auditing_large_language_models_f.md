## Abstract

This interdisciplinary audit of GPT-4 and other LLMs reveals systematic intersectional biases based on names signaling race and gender. Prompts with names suggesting a Black woman received less favorable advice compared to those with white male names. This disparity was robust across 42 prompt templates. The study found that adding quantitative anchors (facts, numbers) to the prompt largely eliminated this bias, whereas adding qualitative descriptive details had inconsistent effects and sometimes amplified stereotypes.
