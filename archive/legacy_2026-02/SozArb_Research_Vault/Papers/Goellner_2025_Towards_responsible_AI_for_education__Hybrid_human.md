## Abstract

Identifies nine persistent challenges undermining responsible use of AI in education, including neglect of key learning processes, lack of stakeholder involvement, and use of unreliable XAI methods. Proposes hybrid human-AI methods, specifically neural-symbolic AI (NSAI), which integrates expert domain knowledge with data-driven approaches. This hybrid architecture allows for built-in transparency, stakeholder engagement, and modeling of complex pedagogically-grounded principles.
