## Abstract

To enable all who participate in educational settings to leverage AI tools for powerful learning, this paper describes a framework and strategies for educational leaders to design and implement a clear approach to AI Literacy for their specific audiences (e.g. learners, teachers, or others) that are safe and effective. The first part of the paper describes a framework that identifies essential components of AI Literacy and connects them to existing initiatives. The second part of the paper identifies strategies and illustrative examples as guidance for educational leaders to integrate AI Literacy in PK–12 education and adapt to their unique contexts.
