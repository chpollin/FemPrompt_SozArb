## Abstract

Critical analysis examining how surveillance capitalism logic manifests in public sector through Denmark's automated welfare decision-making systems. Argues that unless more human-centric approaches are adopted, digital welfare states advance digital technocracy treating citizens as data points for calculation and prediction rather than individuals with agency and rights. Employs theories of surveillance capitalism, digital-era governance, and data politics to analyze automated decision support deployment by state actors. Key concerns include data maximization, profiling, surveillance, and citizen disempowerment through predictive analytics used to identify fraud and vulnerability. Demonstrates how Danish municipalities' enthusiasm for AI-driven welfare administration mirrors tech giants' commercial data exploitation.
