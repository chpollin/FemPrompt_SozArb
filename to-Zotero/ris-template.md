Here's how to structure an RIS template for your entries, using the **Abstract** field for the concise summary and the **Notes** (`N1`) field for the quality assessment:

### RIS Template Example:

```
TY  - JOUR
AU  - Jääskeläinen, P.
AU  - Sharma, N. K.
AU  - Pallett, H.
AU  - Åsberg, C.
PY  - 2025
TI  - Intersectional analysis of visual generative AI: The case of Stable Diffusion
JO  - AI & Society
DO  - 10.1007/s00146-025-02207-y
UR  - https://doi.org/10.1007/s00146-025-02207-y
AB  - This open-access paper provides a feminist intersectional critique of Stable Diffusion, revealing how AI-generated visuals reflect and amplify societal biases like racism, sexism, ableism, and colonialism. It highlights that AI outputs default to Eurocentric, able-bodied, masculine presentations, reinforcing power imbalances. The authors advocate a social justice-oriented approach, emphasizing critical feminist literacies to identify and repair biases through responsible AI design.
N1  - Quality: High. Published in AI & Society, a peer-reviewed Springer journal (Scopus Q2). Methodologically rigorous qualitative visual analysis; strong theoretical grounding. Timely topic and clear presentation. No citation record yet, but credible due to established journal and detailed interdisciplinary approach.
ER  -
