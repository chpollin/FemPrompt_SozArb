## Abstract

Background: Large  language  models  (LLMs)  are  increasingly  used  by  patients  for  health  information  and  preliminary medical  advice.  In  patient-facing  consultations,  users  may  present  explicitly  stated  diagnostic  preferences  or  symptom narratives  emphasizing  a  preferred  explanation.  Such  cognitively  biased  input  constrains  the  diagnostic  context  available to the model and may systematically steer its reasoning during interactive LLM-supported health consultations.

Methods: We  developed  a  simulated  patient  agent  to  generate  both  unbiased  and  cognitively  biased  consultations  using 1273  medical  question  answering  dataset  United  States  Medical  Licensing  Examination  cases.  Six  widely  used  LLMs  of varying capacities were evaluated through 3-round, multiturn dialogues, after which each model produced a final diagnostic judgment  based  on  the  complete  consultation  record.  Diagnostic  accuracy  was  the  primary  outcome.  Secondary  outcomes included bias-induced accuracy decline (absolute reduction in accuracy under biased vs standard consultations) and bias-influenced error proportion (proportion of incorrect responses aligned with the patient's preferred but incorrect diagnosis). Three prompt-based mitigation strategies and 4 decoding temperature settings were tested. In addition, a dual-system framework was evaluated,  in  which  a  conversational  foundation  LLM  conducted  patient  interaction  and  history  taking  (System  1),  while  a reasoning-oriented LLM (o1-mini) generated the final diagnostic judgment (System 2). In the foundation-only condition, the same LLM performed both interaction and diagnosis.

Objective: This study aimed to quantify the impact of patient cognitive bias on LLM diagnostic performance in multiturn consultations,  assess  the  effectiveness  of  prompt-based  mitigation  strategies  and  decoding  temperature  adjustment,  and evaluate a dual-system framework for improving robustness under biased interaction.

Results: Across  all  6  evaluated  models,  cognitively  biased  consultations  led  to  marked  diagnostic  accuracy  declines  of approximately  7  to  39  percentage  points  compared  with  standard  multiturn  consultations,  whereas  static  single-response tests and standard consultations showed comparable accuracy. Larger deteriorations were observed in lower-capacity models, with  some  approaching  random-guess  performance  under  bias.  Errors  were  frequently  aligned  with  patient  bias,  with  biasinfluenced  error  proportion  exceeding  one-third  across  models,  indicating  systematic  conformity  rather  than  random  error. Prompt-based mitigation strategies and decoding temperature reduction yielded limited and inconsistent improvements and did not reliably prevent bias-induced performance loss. By contrast, the dual-system framework substantially improved diagnostic accuracy  under  biased  conditions,  producing  gains  of  approximately  10  to  39  percentage  points  across  most  models  and recovering a large proportion of the performance lost due to bias, particularly in lower-capacity systems.

Conclusions: Patient-driven cognitive bias represents an underrecognized behavioral risk in LLM-supported health consultations.  Common  mitigation  approaches,  such  as  prompt  engineering  or  decoding  parameter  adjustment,  provide  limited resilience.  Explicitly  separating  conversational  interaction  from  deliberative  diagnostic  reasoning  through  a  dual-system

framework enables more robust diagnostic performance under biased input while potentially preserving patient-facing dialogue fluency by retaining the foundation LLM as the conversational component, offering a scalable design strategy for safer medical AI systems.

## Introduction

The  rapid  diffusion  of  conversational  artificial  intelligence (AI)  is  reshaping  how  people  access  health  information. Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and Gemini increasingly  serve  as  informal  health  advisors-interpreting test  results,  answering  symptom  queries,  and  suggesting treatments.  Recent  national  surveys  show  that  17%  of  US adults use AI chatbots monthly for health advice [1], 9.9% of Australians have sought medical information from ChatGPT in  the  past  6  months  [2],  and  21.5%  of  US  respondents reported  using  ChatGPT  for  online  health  information  [3]. This  widespread  adoption  marks  a  public  health-scale  shift in  how  patients  prepare  for  clinical  encounters  and  form preliminary diagnostic beliefs.

Patients  commonly  arrive  at  clinics  with  self-formed  or partial  diagnoses-a  routine  feature  of  modern  health-seeking  behavior.  Such  self-diagnosis  often  reflects  underlying cognitive biases, particularly confirmation bias, which is the tendency  to  favor  evidence  supporting  preexisting  beliefs while disregarding contradictions  [4-6].  When  such  bias originates from patients and interacts with LLMs, its effects can  be  amplified.  Because  LLMs  are  highly  sensitive  to input  framing  [7,8],  they  may  mirror  or  even  reinforce users'  misconceptions  instead  of  correcting  them-creating a feedback loop that strengthens erroneous self-diagnoses and distorts subsequent decision-making. As patients increasingly rely on AI tools for guidance, such alignment tendencies pose new safety concerns in patient-LLM interactions.

Despite the rapid integration of LLMs  into virtual consultations [9,10], health education [11], and clinical decision support [12-15], existing evaluations remain largely model-centric. They emphasize architecture and training data rather than behavioral variability that shapes real-world dialogues.  Regulatory  bodies  have  begun  to  recognize  this oversight:  the  US  Food  and  Drug  Administration  has  called for  incorporating  user  behavioral  factors  in  AI  assessments [16],  and  the  World  Health  Organization's  2024  Guidance on the Ethics and Governance of Large Multimodal Models highlights  the  need  for  transparent  oversight  and  inclusive governance to safeguard equitable use [17]. However, systematic  evaluation  of  how  patient-driven  bias  influences LLM reasoning remains absent.

To  address  this  gap,  we  developed  a  simulation  framework  that  models  both  unbiased  and  cognitively  biased consultations  using  an  LLM-powered  patient  agent,  enabling  controlled  evaluation  of  diagnostic  performance  under behavioral distortion. Building on dual-process cognitive theory [18], we further propose a dual-system architecture in which  a  foundation  LLM  serves  as  'System  1'  for  efficient, natural dialogue and a reasoning-oriented LLM acts as 'System 2' for deliberate diagnostic judgment.

The  aim  of  this  study  was  to  identify  patient  cognitive bias as a user-driven risk factor in patient-LLM interactions, distinct from model architecture or data quality. Our findings show  that  LLMs  often  align  with  patient  misconceptions, amplifying the risk of erroneous understanding and decisionmaking.  To  achieve  this  aim,  we  introduce  a  reproducible simulation  framework  to  quantify  diagnostic  performance under bias-influenced interactions and evaluate whether a  dual-system  design-integrating  a  conversational  foundation  model  for  efficient  dialogue  with  a  reasoning  model for  analytical  judgment-enhances  resilience  to  cognitive bias  while  aiming  to  maintain  conversational  fluency  by retaining  the  foundation  model  for  patient-facing  interaction.  By  systematically  incorporating  behavioral  variability into  evaluation,  this  work  extends  current  evidence  on  the reliability  of  medical  LLMs  and  provides  design  considerations for safer, bias-aware patient-facing health applications.

## Methods

## Evaluation Setup and Medical Question Answering Benchmark

We  evaluated  the  clinical  judgment  performance  of  LLMs using  2  complementary  approaches:  (1)  multiturn  simulated patient-LLM  interactions  and  (2)  single-response  tests.  All evaluations were automated via a Python 3.13.0-based script to ensure consistency and reproducibility (Figure 1).

The  benchmark  dataset  was  the  MedQA-USMLE  (medical question  answering  dataset  United  States  Medical  Licensing Examination),  which  contains  1273  multiple-choice  clinical cases assessing diagnostic accuracy, treatment planning, and overall  clinical  judgment.  Each  case  comprises  a  clinical scenario,  a  question,  4  answer  options  (1  correct  and  3 distractors),  and  the  reference  answer.  Before  generating cognitively  biased  patient  dialogues,  we  used  a  separate GPT-4o-Mini-based scoring step to evaluate incorrect options based  on  their  potential  to  serve  as  plausible  but  misleading  patient  explanations  and  selected  the  highest-scoring distractor  to  condition  the  biased  simulation.  When  multiple incorrect  options  received  the  same  highest  score,  the  final selection among the tied options was performed randomly.

## Simulated Patient Agent Design Framework

LLMs  have  been  shown  to  simulate  human-like  behavior and  cognitive  bias  in  controlled  settings  [19,20].  Building on these findings, we  developed  a  structured  simulated patient  agent  that  models  both  standard  and  biased  consultations  by  manipulating  information  emphasis  and  framing rather than omitting diagnostic  content.  This  framework enables controlled evaluation of LLM diagnostic performance under behaviorally biased interactions (Figure 2; Multimedia Appendix 1).

<!-- PAGE 4 -->

## JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH

Figure 2. Framework of simulated patient-large language models (LLMs) interactions under standard and cognitively biased conditions.

<!-- image -->

The  framework  illustrates  how  a  simulated  patient  agent, powered  by  GPT-4o-Mini,  engages  with  foundation  LLMs under 2 distinct interaction patterns. In standard interactions, the  patient  provides  a  comprehensive  and  accurate  account of  their  condition.  In  cognitively  biased  interactions,  the patient adopts a preferred but incorrect option (selected from MedQA distractors) and selectively emphasizes and interprets information in a manner consistent with this incorrect self-diagnosis,  while  potentially  contradictory  information remains present but is downweighted. Each foundation LLM responds  using  either  standard  role  prompts  or  mitigationstrategy prompts, depending on the evaluation condition.

The protocol standardizes patient presentations and controls key variables to ensure comparability across models, with 2 core components:

2. Interaction patterns: (1) Standard patient provides a comprehensive, unbiased account of their condition. (2) Cognitively biased patient adopts a preferred but incorrect diagnostic explanation or MedQA distractor generated by GPT-4o-Mini based on an incorrect MedQA answer. This patient selectively emphasizes and interprets information consistent with the incorrect self-diagnosis and maintains this belief throughout the interaction, while potentially contradictory information
1. Clinical scenario context: The patient agent's description is derived directly from MedQA test scenarios, ensuring that clinically relevant information is preserved and that no irrelevant or fabricated content is introduced across both standard and cognitively biased interaction modes.

remains present but is downweighted in the patient's narrative. This interaction pattern challenges the LLM's diagnostic reasoning by introducing biased framing rather than information insufficiency.

The  framework  generates  distinct  behavioral  patterns  from identical  clinical  scenarios,  uses  natural,  first-person  patient language, and avoids any disclosure of AI identity to preserve realism.  Together,  these  constraints  ensured  that  the  patient agent  operated  as  a  controlled  simulation  component  rather than an unconstrained conversational model.

After evaluating  candidate  models,  GPT-4o-Mini  was selected  to  implement  the  patient  agent  because  it  balances cost-effectiveness  and  response  speed  with  the  ability  to generate clinically coherent, realistic interactions, while also consistently reproducing bias-aligned behaviors (eg, selective emphasis,  biased  interpretation,  and  repetition),  making  it well  suited  for  simulating  cognitively  biased  patients.  To ensure  consistency  and  reproducibility, the patient  agent was  operated  under  constrained  instructions  using  predefined clinical information only, with fixed model parameters (temperature=1)  across  simulations  to  maintain  consistent behavioral  patterns  while  allowing  natural  conversational variability.  This  design  was  intended  to  simulate  a  strong self-diagnosis  framing  condition  for  controlled  evaluation, rather  than  the  full  range  of  patient  bias  observed  in  real consultations.

## Multiturn Patient-LLM Consultation Simulation

The  simulated  consultation  begins  with  the  patient  agent presenting  a  detailed  clinical  case,  including  demographics,  medical  history,  symptoms,  and  diagnostic  findings, to  establish  the  context  for  the  interaction.  To  maintain realism,  the  evaluated  LLMs  do  not  have  direct  access  to the  original  MedQA  scenario  text;  instead,  they  must  elicit and  interpret  relevant  information  through  dialogue.  Each consultation  unfolds  over  3  rounds  of  interaction  with  the patient agent (Figure 2), during which the LLM progressively gathers  clinical  details  and  refines  its  diagnostic  reasoning. This multiturn structure is designed to approximate real-world patient-LLM consultations.

An  example  of  dialogue  and  evaluation  records  between standard and cognitively biased patient agents and the LLMs is provided in Multimedia Appendix 2. To ensure comparability  across  models,  the  interaction  structure  was  standardized by  instructing  physician  models  to  respond  directly  to  the patient consultation without introductory role announcements or meta-narrative statements.

## LLMs and Temperature Settings

We  evaluated  6  widely  used  foundation  LLMs  of  varying capacities  to  assess  susceptibility  to  patient  cognitive  bias in simulated consultations: GPT-4o  (gpt-4o-2024-11-20), GPT-4o-Mini (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18), ChatGPT-3.5-Turbo (gpt-3.5-turbo-0125), Gemini 1.5 Pro (gemini-1.5-pro), Gemini 1.5 Flash (gemini-1.5-flash-002), and Gemini 1.5 Flash-8B (gemini-1.5-flash-8b). All selected models demonstrated  baseline  medical  reasoning  competence,  with static  benchmark accuracy exceeding 50% [21-23], enabling a representative comparison across different model capacities and deployment profiles.

These models span a spectrum from high-capacity general-purpose  systems  with  strong  reasoning  capabilities (eg, GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro) to efficiency-optimized and  lower-capacity  variants  (eg,  GPT-4o-Mini,  Gemini  1.5 Flash-8B),  reflecting  real-world  patient-facing  deployment settings.  For  contextual  comparison  within  the  dual-system framework,  we  additionally  reference  o1-mini,  a  reasoningoriented  model  explicitly  optimized  for  structured,  deliberative  problem-solving,  which  was  used  as  the  System  2 component [24].

To examine the effect of output determinism on robustness to  biased  input,  each  model  was  evaluated  at  4  decoding temperatures (T=1.0, 0.7, 0.3, and 0.0) in both static singleresponse evaluations and multiturn simulated consultations.

## Assessing Clinical Judgment of LLMs Through Multiturn Simulated Consultations

After 3 rounds of simulated consultation between the patient agent  and  the  LLM,  the  model  was  instructed  to  generate a  final  diagnostic  judgment  based  on  the  complete  consultation  record,  using  the  instruction:  'Please  provide  your answer  by  stating  only  the  option  letter  (A/B/C/D)  without any explanation.'

The final diagnostic judgment was generated after completion  of  the  consultation,  based  on  the  full  interaction  record,  rather  than  as  part  of  the  ongoing  dialogue. The  selected  answer  was  then  compared  with  the  MedQA reference answer to ensure a consistent and objective evaluation  of  clinical  judgment  accuracy  (see  Multimedia Appendix  3).  In  the  foundation-only  condition,  the  same model  was  responsible  for  both  conducting  the  multiturn consultation  and  generating  the  final  diagnostic  judgment, following the  same  judgment  procedure  as  used  in  the dual-system framework.

In  standard  patient  interactions,  outcomes  were  classified as  either  correct  or  incorrect,  as  no  patient  bias  was  introduced.  In  cognitively  biased  interactions,  outcomes  were categorized into 3 types:

- Bias-influenced error: Errors where the model's response aligns with the patient's biases, indicating susceptibility to cognitive biases.
- Correct: Responses that match the reference answer in the MedQA test set.
- Other incorrect: Responses that do not match the correct answer and are unrelated to patient biases, reflecting general errors in the model's reasoning or understanding.

## Mitigation Strategy

To mitigate the impact of patient cognitive bias on diagnostic reasoning, we  developed 3 prompt-engineering strategies and assessed their effectiveness within the simulated patient-LLM interaction framework. All strategies  were  implemented  in  a  zero-shot  setting  and designed  to  modulate  the  LLM's  role  behavior  during consultations and final clinical judgment.

- All-inclusive: Directs the model to 'consider all relevant medical aspects' before responding, thereby broadening the diagnostic scope, reducing selective attention to bias-congruent information, and prioritizing evidence-based decision-making.
- Bias-aware: Instructs the model to identify potential cognitive bias in patient inputs by distinguishing subjective assertions from objective clinical facts. This enables real-time bias detection without predefined examples, supporting scalable recognition of novel bias patterns.
- Step-by-step: Instructs the model to separate objective data from subjective content before making decisions, ensuring that clinical conclusions are grounded in verifiable information rather than patient-driven bias.

Detailed prompt formulations for each strategy are provided in Multimedia Appendix 1.

## Dual-System Framework

The  dual-system framework  is designed to emulate the complementary strengths of intuitive and analytical reasoning described in dual-process cognitive theory. In this design, the foundation  LLM  (System  1)  conducts  a  3-round  interactive

<!-- PAGE 6 -->

consultation with  the simulated  patient agent, efficiently eliciting the  patient's  history  and  generating  preliminary clinical  impressions.  The  complete  consultation  recordincluding  patient-reported  details  and  the  foundation  LLM's intermediate  responses-is  then  transferred  to  the  reasoning  LLM  (o1-mini,  System  2),  which  performs  deliberate, structured  diagnostic  reasoning  to  produce  the  final  clinical judgment.  Model  outputs  are  compared  with  the  correct MedQA reference answers to assess diagnostic accuracy. This division of labor is intended to preserve the speed and fluency of  patient  interaction  while  enhancing  diagnostic  robustness through targeted analytical evaluation.

## Statistical Analysis

All analyses were descriptive. Diagnostic accuracy in multiturn consultation conditions was reported  as  mean accuracy  (SD,  in  %)  across  3  repeated  runs,  with  each run  including  all  1273  MedQA-USMLE  test  cases.  Static single-response  evaluations  were  performed  once  and  are reported without SD. Bias-induced accuracy decline (BIAD) was defined as the absolute reduction in accuracy (percentage points [pp]) from standard to cognitively biased consultations. Bias-influenced  error  proportion  (BIEP)  was  defined  as  the proportion  of  incorrect  responses  under  cognitively  biased consultations  that  aligned  with  the  patient's  preferred  but incorrect option. For the dual-system framework, recovery of bias-induced  loss  (%)  was  calculated  relative  to  the  corresponding foundation-only baseline.

## Ethical Considerations

This simulation-based study used publicly available, deidentified data and involved no human participants. Therefore, ethics approval, informed consent, and participant compensation were not required. All materials are nonidentifiable.

## Results

## Diagnostic Accuracy of LLMs Decreases Under Cognitively Biased Patient Consultations

Across all 6 evaluated foundation models, diagnostic accuracy declined markedly during biased consultations compared  with  both  static  single-response  tests  and  standard  multiturn  consultations  (Figure  3).  Static  and  standard  accuracies  were  largely  comparable  within  each  model (difference≤6  pp),  suggesting  that  interactive  dialogue  itself did  not  substantially  affect  diagnostic  performance  in  the absence of patient bias.

Each panel represents one model evaluated across 3 scenarios-static  evaluation,  standard  interaction,  and  cognitively biased  interaction.  Colored  points  show  mean  diagnostic accuracy (%) across 3 repeated runs (1273 MedQA-USMLE cases  per  run).  Gray  connecting  lines  link  results  from  the same model across scenarios, and the dashed horizontal line marks the 25% random-guess baseline. All values shown are from  the  default  decoding  temperature  setting  (T=1.0);  full temperature analyses are provided in Multimedia Appendix 4.

Lower-capacity  models  showed  the  steepest  deterioration under biased consultations. ChatGPT-3.5-Turbo declined from  64.0%  (SD  0.6%)  accuracy  in  standard  consultations to  25.0%  (SD  0.9%)  under  bias  (-39.0  pp),  and  Gemini 1.5  Flash-8B  declined  from  61.3%  (SD  0.7%)  to  35.5% (SD  0.6%;  -25.8  pp),  with  both  models  approaching  the 25% random-guess baseline.  Mid-capacity  models  exhibited moderate  declines.  Gemini  1.5  Flash  decreased  from  68.0% (SD 0.7%) to 48.5% (SD 0.7%; -19.5 pp), and GPT-4o-Mini declined from 69.5% (SD 0.7%) to 47.5% (SD 0.8%; -22.0 pp). High-capacity models were comparatively resilient. Gemini  1.5  Pro  showed  a  smaller  reduction,  from  72.8% (SD  0.9%)  to  65.8%  (SD  0.8%;  -7.0  pp),  while  GPT-4o declined  from  82.3%  (SD  0.6%)  to  73.8%  (SD  0.5%;  -8.5 pp), maintaining performance well above the random-chance threshold.  Specifically,  in  the  more  affected  models,  this corresponds to approximately 258 to 390 additional incorrect outcomes per 1000 consultations in this evaluation setting.

Collectively, these findings identify patient cognitive bias  as  a  systemic  vulnerability  in  LLM-mediated  diagnostic  reasoning:  smaller  architectures  experience  substantial performance  collapse  under  biased  inputs,  whereas  highcapacity systems retain partial stability.

## Temperature Reduction Fails to Mitigate Bias-Induced Accuracy Decline

Reducing  decoding  temperature  increases  output  determinism  and  is  often  assumed  to  improve  reliability  in  structured reasoning tasks. To test whether this strategy enhances robustness to cognitively biased patient inputs, we evaluated all 6 models at 4 decoding settings (T=1.0, 0.7, 0.3, and 0.0).

In standard consultations, temperature reduction produced modest, model-dependent gains in high-capacity models (eg, GPT-4o:  +3.2  pp;  Gemini  1.5  Pro:  +4.7  pp),  suggesting limited  stabilization  of  diagnostic  reasoning  under  unbiased conditions.

In  biased  consultations,  however,  lowering  the  temperature did not mitigate performance decline and further degraded accuracy in lower-capacity models (eg, Gemini 1.5 Flash-8B: -13.3 pp; ChatGPT-3.5-Turbo: -2.8 pp), approaching random-guess levels. High-capacity models showed relatively  stable  performance  but  no  consistent  benefit  from temperature reduction (Multimedia Appendix 4).

Overall, temperature tuning failed to alleviate bias-induced performance loss, indicating that increased determinism offers  limited  protection  against  patient  cognitive  bias  and may exacerbate instability in lower-capacity models.

## LLMs Tend to Conform to Patient Cognitive Biases

We analyzed diagnostic error patterns during biased consultations using 2 complementary metrics. BIEP quantifies  the  fraction  of  errors  aligning  with  a  patient's incorrect  self-diagnosis,  while  BIAD  measures  the  absolute reduction  in  diagnostic  accuracy  (pp)  between  biased  and standard consultations.

At the default decoding temperature (T=1.0), all 6 models exhibited substantial bias alignment,  with  BIEP values  exceeding  the  random  baseline  of  one-third  (33.3%). The  strongest  conformity  occurred  in  ChatGPT-3.5-Turbo (BIEP=81.0%),  whereas  Gemini  1.5  Pro  showed  the  lowest alignment  (BIEP=46.7%),  indicating  partial  but  incomplete resistance  to  patient  bias.  High-capacity  models  such  as GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro displayed smaller BIAD values (7 -9  pp)  compared  with  lower-capacity  models  such  as Gemini 1.5 Flash-8B (25.8 pp) or ChatGPT-3.5-Turbo (39.0 pp).

As  shown  in  Figure  4,  BIEP  and  BIAD  were  strongly positively correlated ( r =0.97): models with larger biasinduced performance loss also produced a higher proportion of  bias-aligned  errors.  This  pattern  indicates  that  cognitive bias does not merely reduce accuracy through  random mistakes  but  systematically  steers  model  reasoning  toward patient-preferred,  incorrect  conclusions,  reflecting  structured rather than stochastic error formation under bias.

Each point represents one model evaluated at the default decoding temperature (T=1.0). The y -axis is scaled from 33% upward to emphasize that all models exceeded the empirical threshold of random error alignment. Models located in the upper-right quadrant  exhibit  both  larger  accuracy  declines  and  stronger conformity with patient-preferred but incorrect diagnoses.

## Efficacy of Prompt-Based Mitigation Strategies

We evaluated 3 prompt-based strategies-bias-aware, all-inclusive, and step-by-step mitigation-for their ability to

| Gemini 1.5 Flash    | 48.5 (0.7)            | 49.0 (0.4); +0.5              | 54.0 (0.5); +5.5               | 51.0 (0.6); +2.5              |
| Gemini 1.5 Flash-8B | 35.5 (0.6)            | 37.3 (0.3); +1.8              | 39.8 (0.8); +4.3               | 33.0 (0.3); -2.5              |
| GPT-4o              | 73.8 (0.5)            | 76.0 (0.5); +2.2              | 78.6 (0.6); +4.8               | 70.9 (0.7); -2.9              |
| GPT-4o-Mini         | 47.5 (0.8)            | 45.0 (0.6); -2.5              | 50.0 (0.4); +2.5               | 40.5 (0.7); -7.0              |
| ChatGPT-3.5-Turbo   | 25.0 (0.9)            | 32.8 (0.9); +7.8              | 29.6 (0.4); +4.6               | 19.1 (0.6); -5.9              |

a pp: percentage point.

The  step-by-step  approach,  prompting  models  to  separate objective from subjective information, showed mixed results: small gains in some high-capacity models (+2.0 pp in Gemini 1.5  Pro;  +2.5  pp  in  Gemini  1.5  Flash)  but  decreases  in lower-capacity models (-2.5 pp in Gemini 1.5 Flash-8B; -5.9 pp in ChatGPT-3.5-Turbo).

The bias-aware strategy, which instructed models to identify  and  adjust  for  patient  bias,  yielded  modest  but inconsistent improvements. GPT-4o showed a small increase (+2.2  pp),  while  ChatGPT-3.5-Turbo  improved  by  +7.8  pp; other models showed minimal change.

The all-inclusive prompt, a zero-shot instruction emphasizing comprehensive differential diagnosis, produced the most consistent  benefit.  High-capacity  models  such  as  GPT-4o (+4.8  pp)  and  Gemini  1.5  Pro  (+3.7  pp)  recovered  roughly half of their bias-induced accuracy loss, whereas smaller and mid-capacity models showed modest gains of approximately 2.5 to 5.5 pp.

Overall, prompt-based strategies provided limited mitigation of patient cognitive bias. Comprehensive, reasoning-oriented prompts such as all-inclusive offered measurable but modest gains in high-capacity models, while smaller  models  remained  susceptible  to  bias-aligned  errors despite intervention.

## Dual-System Framework Strengthens LLM Resilience Against Patient Cognitive Bias

We  evaluated  a  dual-system  framework  that  integrates  a foundation LLM for multiturn patient interaction (System 1) with a reasoning-oriented LLM (o1-mini, System 2) for final diagnostic  judgment,  assessing  its  ability  to  mitigate  biasinduced  performance  degradation  (Table  2).  The  dual-system  framework  consistently  improved  diagnostic  accuracy across most models compared with foundation-only baselines under both standard and cognitively biased consultations; the exception was GPT-4o, for which biased-condition accuracy decreased slightly from 73.8% to 72.8%. For reference, when evaluated  as  a  standalone  model  under  the  same  multiturn protocol,  o1-mini  exhibited  only  a  minimal  performance decrease,  from  87.2%  (SD  0.8%)  under  standard  interaction to 85.1% (SD 0.5%) under cognitively biased interaction.

In standard consultations, accuracy increased  to  77.8% -85.2%  across models,  compared  with  61.3% -82.3%  for foundation-only performance. The largest gains were observed in lower-capacity models, such as reduce diagnostic performance loss during cognitively biased patient consultations (Table 1).

In biased consultations, the dual-system framework achieved  63.7% -75.5%  accuracy,  compared  with  25.0% -73.8%  for  foundation-only  models.  Performance  recovery was most pronounced in bias-prone models such as Gemini 1.5 Flash-8B (+30.3 pp) and ChatGPT-3.5-Turbo (+38.7 pp), restoring approximately 90% -140% of the bias-induced loss.

Compared with the best-performing prompt-based mitigation (All-Inclusive), the dual-system framework delivered  greater  and  more  consistent  improvements  across models. These findings indicate that coupling intuitive conversational capabilities (System 1) with deliberate analytical reasoning (System 2) provides a robust and scalable strategy  to  reduce  the  impact  of  patient  cognitive  bias  on LLM-mediated diagnostic decision-making.

## Discussion

## Behavioral Risk and Key Findings

Across  models,  cognitively  biased  user  framing  systematically redirected diagnostic reasoning toward patient-preferred but incorrect conclusions, resulting in substantial performance degradation.  This  effect  was  consistent  across  interactions, indicating  a  structured  influence  of  user  bias  rather  than random error.

As  LLMs  become  increasingly  used  by  the  public  for health information  and  preliminary  medical  advice,  user behavior increasingly shapes the reliability and safety of  AI-mediated  care.  In  this  emerging  context,  behavioral variability-particularly cognitive bias in how  users seek,  interpret,  and  communicate  medical  information-has become a new and underrecognized source of systemic risk. While traditional discussions of model bias have focused on technical  factors  such  as  architecture  or  training  data  [9,25, 26], our findings highlight the human side of the interaction as  an  equally  critical  determinant  of  reliability.  By  framing cognitive  bias  as  an  interaction-level  risk  rather  than  solely an  individual  limitation,  this  study  underscores  the  need  to account for human behavioral factors as integral components of AI safety in health care.

## Model Vulnerability Under Biased Interaction

Our evaluation shows that even advanced foundation LLMs, despite demonstrating strong baseline medical reasoning relative  to  smaller  or  open-source  counterparts  [27],  remain vulnerable  to  cognitively  biased  patient  interactions.  Under biased  conditions,  lower-capacity  models  exhibited  severe performance deterioration, while elevated proportions of bias-aligned errors revealed a systematic tendency to converge  on  user  misconceptions,  reinforcing  false  beliefs and amplifying health-related misunderstandings.

This  vulnerability  is  particularly  concerning  in  light  of the  high  level  of  public  trust  placed  in  AI-generated  health information.  Users  often  perceive  responses  from  conversational  AI  systems  as  equally  or  more  credible  than  advice from  human  clinicians  [28].  When  such  trust  is  coupled with  bias-congruent  reasoning,  inaccurate  recommendations may be accepted  without  verification,  increasing  the  risk  of delayed  medical  consultation,  the  persistence  of  erroneous beliefs, and unsafe self-management behaviors.

Importantly,  the  marked  deterioration  observed  during biased-but not unbiased-consultations highlights a critical blind spot in prevailing evaluation practices. Existing benchmarks  rely  primarily  on  static,  single-turn  tasks  and therefore  overlook  the  behavioral  and  dialogic  complexity of  real-world  consultations,  failing  to  capture  how  patient framing  can  systematically  distort  reasoning  and  undermine diagnostic reliability [9,29,30].

At  the  level  of  clinical  reasoning,  biased  patient  framing alters the trajectory and weighting of information considered  during  dialogue,  leading  to  failures  of  effective  knowledge  utilization  rather  than  deficits  in  underlying  medical  knowledge.  Once  an  incorrect  preference  is explicitly introduced, agreement-oriented tendencies  may further  stabilize  these  redirected  reasoning  paths,  contributing  to  the  high  proportion  of  bias-aligned  errors  observed. These findings are therefore better understood not as simple hallucination  or  general  conversational  drift  but  as  distortion  of  diagnostic  reasoning  under  patient-driven  framing; more  specifically,  the  present  paradigm  is  most  consistent with  a  self-diagnosis-anchored  framing  effect,  in  which  the patient's  initial  preferred  explanation  creates  an  anchoring point, and subsequent selective emphasis exerts confirmationlike pressure on the dialogue, potentially further amplified by sycophancy-like tendencies in aligned conversational models [31-33].

## Prompting and Parameter Effects

Our findings indicate that, among the evaluated prompt-engineering approaches, only the all-inclusive strategy demonstrated consistent mitigation against patient cognitive bias across interactive  clinical  scenarios.  By  encouraging  consideration of  multiple  diagnostic  possibilities  prior  to  judgment,  the all-inclusive  strategy  may  help  reduce  early  anchoring  on a  patient-preferred  explanation  driven  by  repeated  symptom emphasis.  By  comparison,  the  bias-aware  strategy  showed limited effectiveness, likely because biased framing is

<!-- PAGE 10 -->

often  intertwined  with  clinically  plausible  symptom  descriptions, making  it  difficult, at the time  of interaction, to clearly distinguish cognitive bias from reasonable diagnostic inference. As a zero-shot approach, the all-inclusive strategy also  offers  strong  adaptability  for  real-world  deployment, where models must respond effectively to diverse  and previously unseen patient inputs [34].

Previous  work  has  shown  that  lowering  the  decoding temperature  in  language  models  can  improve  accuracy  by reducing  output  randomness  [35,36].  Our  findings  refine this  understanding by revealing important context-dependent trade-offs.  In  standard  patient  interactions,  lower  temperature  settings  yielded  small  accuracy  gains  in  some  models,  likely  by  favoring  high-probability  clinical  hypotheses. However, in cognitively biased interactions-particularly for  lower-capacity  models-temperature  reduction  increased the  likelihood  of  bias-aligned  responses,  thereby  amplifying diagnostic errors. One plausible explanation is that deterministic  decoding  encourages  early  commitment  to  a  locally high-probability diagnostic hypothesis shaped by the patient's biased  framing,  reducing  the  model's  ability  to  reconsider alternative  explanations  as  the  dialogue  progresses.  More broadly, temperature controls how strongly the model follows high-probability  continuations  conditioned  on  the  conversation  history;  when  the  probability  distribution  has  already been  shifted  by  biased  patient  framing,  lower  temperatures may  reinforce this anchored reasoning path. Alternative decoding strategies, such as nucleus sampling or constrained decoding, may  influence bias propagation and represent directions for future research. This suggests that while deterministic  decoding  can  stabilize  model  outputs,  it  may also  entrench  erroneous  reasoning  when  the  input  context is  biased.  Optimizing  temperature  settings  for  LLM  deployment  in  health  care  will  therefore  require  context-specific calibration, balancing determinism with the flexibility needed to resist bias-driven misinformation.

## Dual-System Framework

Dual-system theory conceptualizes human cognition as operating  through  2  complementary  modes:  a  fast,  intuitive System  1  and  a  slower,  more  deliberative  System  2  [18]. In  clinical  practice,  these  modes  are  reflected  in  the  distinction  between  conversational  history-taking  and  analytic diagnostic reasoning. We adopt this framework to guide the architectural  design  of  patient-facing  LLM  systems,  pairing a  foundation  model  intended  for  rapid,  fluent  interaction with  a  reasoning-oriented  LLM  for  diagnosis  and  treatment planning, consistent with prior evidence that reasoning-oriented  LLMs  achieve  stronger  performance  on  tasks  requiring structured, multistep reasoning [37].

Consistent  with  this  conceptual  alignment,  our  evaluation  shows  that  such  a  dual-system  configuration  improves diagnostic performance in standard consultations and, critically,  mitigates  performance  degradation  under  cognitively biased interactions. By confining deliberative reasoning to  the  final  judgment  stage  while  retaining  the  foundation  LLM  for  upstream  patient  communication,  the  framework  enhances  robustness  to  biased  input  while  reducing the computational and interactional burdens associated with  applying  deliberative  reasoning  throughout  the  entire dialogue. This benefit is most pronounced in lower-capacity systems,  where  additional  reasoning  support  reduces  biasaligned errors and stabilizes performance in bias-prone scenarios.  The  GPT-4o  exception  suggests  that  such  gains may be smaller when the foundation model already has strong internal  reasoning  and  bias  resistance,  as  replacing  its  final judgment with o1-mini provided no additional benefit under biased consultations.

In  practice,  while  o1-mini  shows  stronger  resistance  to biased inputs, it is not optimized for fluent patient interaction and incurs higher reasoning costs, underscoring the need for a collaborative rather than single-model solution. Foundation models,  by  contrast,  may  be  better  suited  for  patient-facing tasks  such  as  clinical  history  collection  because  of  their practical advantages in speed and conversational interaction. Accordingly,  the  dual-system  framework  can  be  understood as a design strategy that confines deliberative reasoning to the final  judgment  stage,  thereby  balancing  diagnostic  robustness  with  practical  efficiency.  Importantly,  this  framework should be interpreted as an architectural strategy rather than a model-specific solution, and other reasoning-oriented models could potentially serve a similar System 2 role by independently evaluating consultation transcripts. From a deployment perspective,  this  architecture  resembles  a  clinical  workflow in  which  conversational  AI  systems  collect  patient  information  while  a  separate  reasoning  or  decision-support  module performs diagnostic evaluation, potentially providing a safer framework for real-world health care applications.

However, the performance of the dual-system framework remains  bounded  by  the  interaction  history  generated  by the  foundation  model.  Under  cognitively  biased  conditions, elements  of  biased  framing  may  persist  in  the  dialogue transcript  and  constrain  downstream  reasoning,  which  may partly  explain  why  dual-system  performance  does  not  fully match  that  of  a  standalone  reasoning  model.  This  effect appears  more  pronounced  when  lower-capacity  foundation models are used, likely because they reinforce biased narratives more strongly during history taking.

## Input Guidance and Feedback

LLMs  are  highly  sensitive  to  user  input  framing,  a  property  that  increases  their  vulnerability  to  biased  or  incomplete  patient  narratives  in  medical  settings.  Guiding  patients toward  more  effective  input  strategies-such  as  structured symptom checklists or guided question prompts-may improve  the  reliability  of  LLM-generated  recommendations and  reduce  variability  in  patient-LLM  interactions.  More broadly, standardized interaction  protocols  that  minimize biased framing could support more consistent and trustworthy communication in patient-facing applications.

This input-output dynamic also has implications for model  refinement.  Reinforcement  Learning  from  Human Feedback  is  widely  used  to  align  LLM  responses  with human preferences and desired outcomes [38,39].  However, in patient-facing scenarios, feedback from cognitively biased users  may  inadvertently  reward  outputs  that  confirm  their

<!-- PAGE 11 -->

misconceptions, reinforcing bias-driven errors. At the current stage  of  AI  deployment  in  health  care,  professional  supervision  and  expert  feedback-rather  than  unfiltered  patient feedback-should guide model optimization, particularly for high-stakes clinical tasks [40].

## Limitations and Future Work

This study focuses on patient-facing interactions and therefore evaluates widely used commercial LLMs  that currently  dominate  real-world  patient  access.  Nevertheless, extending the proposed framework to open-source and locally deployable models remains an important direction for future work.

The simulated patient used verbatim medical terminology (eg,  'a  bulging  disc  impinging  on  a  lumbar  spinal  nerve'), which  may  not  fully  reflect  the  colloquial  nature  of  realworld patient  interactions.  This  design  choice  was  made  for diagnostic clarity, but it may limit the ecological validity of the interactions.

Patient  cognitive  bias  in  this  study  was  operationalized as  an  explicit  self-diagnosis  framing  condition,  in  which the simulated patient adopted a preferred but incorrect explanation  from  the  outset  and  then  displayed  anchoring and  confirmation-like  behavior  throughout  the  consultation. This should be distinguished from more common real-world patient  narratives,  in  which  bias  may  be  subtler  and  unintentional,  for  example  through  selective  symptom  emphasis, omission,  or  framing  without  a  firm  self-diagnosis.  Accordingly,  our  design  represents  a  relatively  high-intensity  and stable bias condition intended to provide a standardized stress test  of  model robustness and may therefore overestimate the magnitude  of  bias-induced  misjudgment  relative  to  many routine  patient-AI  interactions.  In  real  consultations,  patient cognitive  bias  likely  exists  along  a  spectrum,  ranging  from mild  framing  effects  to  persistent  self-diagnosis  anchoring, and  may  be  intermittent,  inconsistent,  or  evolve  during  the interaction  rather  than  remain  stable  throughout.  From  a human-factors perspective, the present design was intended to model  a  clinically  recognizable  higher-intensity  bias  pattern in which patients become anchored to a specific explanation and selectively foreground supporting information. Therefore, the findings should be interpreted as most directly applicable to stronger self-diagnosis-driven bias scenarios rather than to all forms of patient cognitive bias.

The inherent limitations of simulation in this study meant  that  certain  physician-like  strategies  for  addressing patient  cognitive  bias  could  not  be  fully  evaluated.  In  real

## Acknowledgments

consultations,  physicians  may  use  open-ended  questions  to encourage  patient  self-reflection  or  elicit  additional  critical symptoms,  signs,  or  test  results  [41].  In  our  simulations, however,  patient  responses  were  restricted  to  predefined clinical data and their associated biases to avoid introducing uncontrolled  experimental  variables,  limiting  the  scope  for such interactive techniques.

The  Few-Shot  mitigation  condition  was  excluded  from quantitative  analysis  because  its  prompt  design  was  not aligned  with  the  evaluation  requirement  for  forced  finaloption selection.

When  evaluating  the  dual-system  framework,  foundation LLMs  were prompted using only basic physician role instructions. Incorporating alternative prompting strategiessuch as the all-inclusive approach, which encourages consideration of all  relevant  medical  aspects  before  forming a diagnosis-may further enhance the framework's performance and robustness against patient cognitive bias. Moreover, as  this  study  was  conducted  in  a  standardized  simulated consultation environment,  the  interactions  may  not  fully represent  natural  clinical  conversations,  which  may  limit ecological  validity.  In  addition,  only  a  single  generative patient agent was used, and variability across different patient agents was not examined, which may limit generalizability.

Because  MedQA-USMLE is publicly available, commercial  LLMs  may  have  been  exposed  to  some  benchmark items  during  pretraining  or  posttraining,  which  could  inflate absolute  accuracy  estimates  and  affect  the  observed  magnitude of performance decline. Accordingly, our results should be  interpreted  as  within-model  relative  comparisons  under biased  interaction  rather  than  uncontaminated  estimates  of absolute diagnostic competence.

## Conclusions

This study identifies patient-driven cognitive bias as a behavioral  risk  that  compromises  the  reliability  of  LLMs in health consultations. Across 6 contemporary  LLMs, biased  user  input  led  to  substantial  degradation  in  diagnostic accuracy, particularly in lower-capacity systems. Common  mitigation  approaches  such  as  prompt  engineering  or  temperature  adjustment  offered  limited  protection. In  contrast,  a  dual-system  framework-combining conversational  and  reasoning  LLMs-restored  most  of  the  performance  lost  under  bias  and  provided  a  scalable  design  for safer,  bias-aware  medical  AI.  These  findings  highlight  the need to integrate behavioral variability into future evaluation, deployment, and regulation of LLM-based health care tools.
