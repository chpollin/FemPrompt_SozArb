## Abstract

This qualitative study explores current AI applications in social work through interviews with professionals, AI developers, and policymakers, identifying challenges including insufficient decision-making transparency, gaps in ethical frameworks, and inadequate technical literacy among professionals. The research reveals that while ninety percent of social work professionals acknowledge AI's auxiliary function in daily operations, concerns persist about automation bias and the potential undermining of professional autonomy. The study proposes educational training and policy recommendations while advocating for explainable AI systems and strengthened ethical governance to foster harmonious development between technological applications and humanistic values.
