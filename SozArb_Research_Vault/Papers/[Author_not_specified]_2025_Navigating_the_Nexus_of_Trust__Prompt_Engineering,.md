## Abstract

Comprehensive analysis examining how prompt engineering strategies designed to enhance transparency and mitigate bias influence trust that social work professionals place in LLM-generated case recommendations. Synthesizes literature from computer science, social work, ethics, and psychology to construct understanding of complex interplay between technology, human psychology, and professional practice. Develops framework for calibrated trust through responsible prompt engineering, positioning professionals as active directors rather than passive consumers of AI outputs. Proposes that trust emerges from three-way interaction between intentional prompting strategies, professional disposition and expertise, and perceived system trustworthiness across ability, benevolence, and integrity dimensions.
