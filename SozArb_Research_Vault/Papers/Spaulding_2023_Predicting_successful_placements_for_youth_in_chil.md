## Abstract

Study developed machine learning models to predict treatment success for youth in various child welfare placement settings using data from 4,788 youth served by Children's Hope Alliance in North Carolina. Models aimed to distinguish which youth would succeed in high-cost residential psychiatric treatment versus community-based alternatives. Using Treatment Outcome Package (TOP) assessment data and gradient boosting algorithms, models achieved AUROCs >0.70 in predicting placement success. Addresses Family First Prevention Services Act requirement for right level of care determinations. Multiple raters per case improved model accuracy. Demonstrates feasibility of using existing clinical data to inform high-stakes placement decisions.
