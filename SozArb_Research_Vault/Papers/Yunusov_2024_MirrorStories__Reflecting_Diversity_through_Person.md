## Abstract

This empirical study introduces a corpus of 1,500 personalized short stories generated with LLMs, incorporating identity features like gender, ethnicity, and age. Human judges rated these stories higher in engagement, diversity, and personalness. Narrative personalization increased textual diversity without harming moral comprehension. However, biases persist, such as preferential engagement for certain identities. The paper illustrates both potential and limitations of diversity-sensitive prompting.
