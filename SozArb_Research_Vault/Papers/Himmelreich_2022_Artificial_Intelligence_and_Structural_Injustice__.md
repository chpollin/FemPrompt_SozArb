## Abstract

This work develops a structural injustice approach to AI governance based on Iris Marion Young's theory of structural injustice. The authors argue that structural injustice is a powerful conceptual tool that enables researchers and practitioners to identify, articulate, and potentially even anticipate AI bias. The approach includes both an analytical component (structural explanations) and an evaluative component (justice theory) and provides methodological and normative foundations for diversity, equity, and inclusion values.
