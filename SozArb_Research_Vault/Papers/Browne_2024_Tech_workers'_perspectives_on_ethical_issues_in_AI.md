## Abstract

Empirical study examining tech workers' understanding of ethical AI development through feminist lens, revealing critical gaps in current AI ethics approaches. Finds that the term "bias" creates confusion among tech workers, undermining AI ethics initiatives, and argues for moving beyond diversity narratives toward "design justice" that centers marginalized voices.
