## Abstract

Evidence-based recommendations for social work researchers using generative AI and LLMs, addressing prompt engineering and critical engagement with AI outputs. Examines how LLMs can improve research efficiency through facilitating literature reviews, data analysis, and writing assistance while emphasizing need for critical evaluation of AI-generated content. Discusses concerns about over-reliance on AI potentially diminishing research quality when researchers don't engage in critical thinking or rigorous data evaluation. Stresses that AI tools cannot replace human expertise and judgment.
