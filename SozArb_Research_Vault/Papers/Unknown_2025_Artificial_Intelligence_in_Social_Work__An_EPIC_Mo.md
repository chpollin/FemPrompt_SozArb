## Abstract

As artificial intelligence (AI) permeates the workplace environments of social workers, there is a need to understand the risks and benefits posed to the mission and values of the profession. This article examines the influence of artificial intelligence on the profession, including opportunities to advance socially just outcomes and challenges that risk ethical practice. A comprehensive review of literature was conducted to examine existing research on the intersection of AI and social work. Drawing on insights from this review, an EPIC model for integrating artificial intelligence into the profession is presented, consisting of four components: (E) ethics and justice; (P) policy development and advocacy; (I) intersectoral collaboration; and (C) community engagement and empowerment. The author contends that augmenting the benefits of artificial intelligence in social work requires a proactive and ethical approach towards a more secure, safe, transparent, and socially just future.
