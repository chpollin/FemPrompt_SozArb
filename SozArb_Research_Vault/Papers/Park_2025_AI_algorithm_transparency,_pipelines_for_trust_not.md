## Abstract

Peer-reviewed study examining how algorithmic transparency overcomes users' predisposed distrust in AI. 2×2 experiment showing transparency significantly increases trust, especially for those with initially negative AI attitudes. Making AI workings visible mitigated negative relationship between user AI-skepticism and organizational trust. Transparency acts as "signal of trustworthiness," reducing skepticism and uncertainty. Emphasizing transparency in prompts and system design can reassure wary professionals by demonstrating accountability.
