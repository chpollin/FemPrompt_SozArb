## Abstract

Systematic review following PRISMA guidelines analyzing prompt-engineering techniques to reduce cultural bias against Arabs and Muslims in LLMs, evaluating eight empirical studies (2021-2024). Identifies five primary approaches: Cultural Prompting, Affective Priming, Self-Debiasing techniques, structured multi-stage pipelines, and parameter-optimized continuous prompts. Structured multi-stage pipelines most effective with up to 87.7% bias reduction. Emphasizes accessibility of prompt engineering for bias mitigation and importance of transparent methodology for trust building.
