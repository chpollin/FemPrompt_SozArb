## Abstract

Comprehensive feminist framework directly critiques individualized approaches to AI ethics, challenging the "liberal framework of making algorithms unbiased and inclusive" in favor of structural "remediation" addressing "systemic and structural dimensions of discrimination." Examines how AI research is captured by "racial, gendered capitalism" and proposes nine principles focusing on structural power analysis including examining power, challenging power, and making labor visible. Explicitly positions against technical solutions ignoring power structures.
