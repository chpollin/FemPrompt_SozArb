## Abstract

This paper proposes "Reflexive Prompt Engineering" as a comprehensive framework to embed ethical and inclusive principles into prompt crafting for generative AI. Framework consists of five components: prompt design, system selection, system configuration, performance evaluation, and prompt management, each considered from social responsibility perspective. Positions responsible prompt engineering as essential component of AI literacy, bridging gap between AI development and deployment by aligning AI behavior with human rights and diversity values.
