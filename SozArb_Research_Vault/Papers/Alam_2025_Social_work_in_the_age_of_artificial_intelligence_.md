## Abstract

This study develops a comprehensive rights-based framework for navigating AI integration in social work practice while addressing ethical implications across micro, meso, and macro practice levels. The framework bridges social work theory with interdisciplinary insights, demonstrating that AI systems profoundly impact vulnerable populations by mediating interpersonal relationships and constructing meaning in AI-mediated environments. It provides evidence-based guidance for practitioners to harness AI's potential while safeguarding core social work values of human dignity, self-determination, and social justice, offering concrete strategies for social work education and research methodologies that center community voices.
