## Abstract

Critical analysis examining three decision-support algorithms developed for Danish municipalities in child and family social work, analyzing how they affect professional discretion despite claims to merely support professionals. Demonstrates how algorithmic systems designed to minimize subjective judgment and promote efficiency actually embody positivist assumptions that professional discretion can and should be eliminated. Key findings reveal how political actors favor standardized, automated approaches to avoid high-profile cases, effectively negating professional judgment central to ethical social work practice. Drawing on street-level bureaucracy and digitalization literature, argues that framing algorithms as neutral decision support obscures their role in fundamentally restructuring professional autonomy, expertise, and nature of care relationships.
