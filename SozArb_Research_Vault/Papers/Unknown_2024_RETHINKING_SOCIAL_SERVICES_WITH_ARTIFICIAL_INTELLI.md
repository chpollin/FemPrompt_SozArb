## Abstract

This chapter explores the transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in the field of social services. It highlights how AI—through data analysis, predictive modeling, and administrative automation—can enhance the effectiveness, accessibility, and efficiency of social work practice. The chapter also presents significant ethical concerns, including risks of algorithmic bias, loss of human connection, and violations of privacy. The author emphasizes that while AI can complement social work, it cannot replace the human-centered values at the core of the profession. It concludes by urging institutions and educational programs to prepare social workers for ethical and effective use of AI and calls for multidisciplinary collaboration to develop guidelines that ensure AI integration supports social justice, equality, and human rights.
