## Abstract

Case study documenting four-stage social implementation of AI system (AiCAN - Assistant of Intelligence for Child Abuse and Neglect) in Japanese Child Guidance Centers from 2012-2020. System uses machine learning to predict child abuse recurrence and Bayesian networks for real-time probabilistic inference to guide temporary protection decisions. Data from over 6,000 cases (2014-2018) were used to develop gradient boosting algorithms with AUROC >0.70. Implementation involved iterative stakeholder engagement, workflow redesign, training field staff, and addressing organizational resistance. Emphasizes critical importance of building consensus with practitioners, designing for field usability, ensuring data quality through validated scales, and employing eXplainable AI for transparency.
