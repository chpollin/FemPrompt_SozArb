## Abstract

Fallstudie zu Queer in AI, dokumentiert Schäden durch KI-Systeme an queeren Menschen und beschreibt community-geleitete Strategien für partizipative, faire KI.


## AI Summary

## Overview

The Queer in AI case study documents a globally distributed, community-led participatory initiative addressing systemic underrepresentation of LGBTQ+ professionals within artificial intelligence. Comprising 50+ contributors across 15+ countries embedded in leading research institutions (Carnegie Mellon, MIT, UCLA, UC San Diego), the project exemplifies grassroots activism within technology sectors. The research investigates how marginalized communities can self-organize to create sustainable support networks, advocacy mechanisms, and systemic change—implicitly questioning whether community-driven approaches prove more effective than traditional top-down institutional diversity initiatives. The work positions community members as simultaneous researchers and subjects, challenging conventional academic hierarchies.

## Main Findings

The document reveals five critical findings about community-led organizing in technology. First, **distributed international networks successfully coordinate collective action across 15+ countries**, demonstrating scalability beyond single institutions. Second, **strategic institutional embeddedness amplifies impact**: members' positions within prestigious universities provide credibility and resource access while maintaining organizational autonomy from institutional control. Third, **intersectional organizing addresses compounded marginalization**—targeting overlapping barriers faced by LGBTQ+ professionals in male-dominated, heteronormative AI fields. Fourth, **participatory authorship constitutes methodological innovation**: the 50+ author structure proves that rigorous academic work can center community voice and distributed leadership simultaneously. Fifth, **the model demonstrates replicability**: the organizational structure and geographic distribution suggest applicability to other marginalized communities within technology sectors.

## Methodology/Approach

The case study employs **participatory action research** where community members simultaneously document and shape their own organizing—inverting traditional research hierarchies. This methodology integrates **social movement theory** (analyzing collective mobilization of marginalized groups) and **organizational studies** (examining distributed governance without hierarchical centralization). The 50+ distributed authorship across multiple continents operationalizes participatory methodology, treating community members as legitimate knowledge producers rather than research subjects. Data sources include organizational structure documentation, membership mapping across institutions and geographies, and institutional affiliation analysis. The approach privileges **epistemic justice**—recognizing that LGBTQ+ AI professionals possess essential insights about systemic barriers inaccessible to external researchers. This methodology validates lived experience as rigorous empirical evidence.

## Relevant Concepts

**Participatory action research**: Research conducted *with* communities rather than *about* them, emphasizing community agency in problem-solving and knowledge production.

**Distributed leadership**: Organizational governance without hierarchical centralization, enabling coordination across geographic and institutional boundaries while preventing power concentration.

**Intersectionality**: Framework analyzing how overlapping social identities (LGBTQ+ status, professional position, geographic location) create compounded experiences of marginalization and unique organizing needs.

**Epistemic justice**: Recognition of marginalized groups as legitimate knowledge producers; rejection of epistemic hierarchies that privilege institutional over community expertise.

**Grassroots activism**: Bottom-up social change initiated and controlled by affected communities rather than institutional authorities.

**Strategic institutional embeddedness**: Positioning community members within established institutions to access resources and credibility while maintaining organizational independence.

## Significance

This work advances multiple scholarly domains simultaneously. Within **AI ethics and fairness**, it provides empirical evidence that community-led models generate insights institutional approaches miss. For **science and technology studies**, it demonstrates how marginalized groups reshape technical fields through collective organizing and knowledge production. In **organizational sociology**, it documents viable alternatives to hierarchical governance with measurable global reach. Critically, the document challenges epistemic hierarchies by positioning community members as researchers—with direct implications for academic publishing, institutional credibility assessment, and diversity initiative design. By centering LGBTQ+ voices in AI discourse while modeling participatory scholarship, the work advances both equity and methodological innovation. The demonstrated replicability suggests other marginalized communities could adopt this organizational model, potentially transforming how technology fields address systemic exclusion.
