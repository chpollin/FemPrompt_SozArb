## Abstract

Systematic literature review (2010-2020) identifying 12 main ethical issues in AI healthcare applications with direct relevance to social services. Critical value tensions identified include justice and fairness (algorithmic bias causing discrimination), freedom and autonomy (control, respecting human autonomy, and informed consent challenges), privacy violations through data-driven systems, transparency conflicts with black-box algorithms, dignity concerns when AI reduces persons to data, and conflicts in decision-making between AI and human judgment. Review analyzed 45 documents and identified 19 ethical sub-issues, providing strategies for each. Emphasizes human-centered approach respecting fundamental rights and European values.
