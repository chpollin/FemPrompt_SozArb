## Abstract

This study investigates if Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting reduces implicit gender bias in LLMs. Using a synthetic task of counting gendered words, the authors found that without step-by-step prompting, models made biased errors. CoT prompting, which forced the model to explicitly label each word's gender before counting, significantly reduced these mistakes. This suggests that guiding the model through an explicit reasoning process makes it rely more on logic than on stereotypes, thereby mitigating bias.
