## Abstract

Systematic review synthesizing 27 studies on clinicians' trust in AI decision-support tools. Identifies eight key factors shaping professional trust, notably system transparency as primary enabler. Lack of transparency was recurring barrier with "black-box" algorithms undermining trust. Improving transparency, providing explainable recommendations, and addressing bias/fairness issues recommended to bolster trust. Concludes transparent, explainable AI with proper training and ethical safeguards crucial for practitioner trust.
