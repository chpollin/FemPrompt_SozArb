## Abstract

Systematic review synthesizing 27 studies on clinicians' trust in AI decision-support tools. Identifies eight key factors shaping professional trust, notably system transparency as primary enabler. Lack of transparency was recurring barrier with "black-box" algorithms undermining trust. Improving transparency, providing explainable recommendations, and addressing bias/fairness issues recommended to bolster trust. Concludes transparent, explainable AI with proper training and ethical safeguards crucial for practitioner trust.


## AI Summary

## Overview

The PRISMA 2020 Checklist is a **standardized reporting guideline**—not empirical research—that establishes normative requirements for documenting systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Comprising 27 mandatory reporting items distributed across six sections (Title, Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion), PRISMA 2020 functions as a meta-methodological governance tool rather than a substantive research contribution. Developed through consensus among methodologists, researchers, and stakeholders, this framework evolved from PRISMA 2009 to address emerging systematic review methodologies including network meta-analyses and qualitative syntheses. The checklist operationalizes a fundamental principle: systematic reviews require standardized, transparent documentation to enable critical appraisal, prevent selective reporting bias, and facilitate integration into broader evidence synthesis efforts. PRISMA 2020 has achieved normative authority as the gold standard adopted by major journals, funding agencies, and research institutions globally.

## Main Findings

The PRISMA 2020 Checklist establishes comprehensive reporting standards across four integrated domains. **Design specification** (Items 1-5) requires explicit documentation of review identification, abstract completeness, rationale, objectives, and eligibility criteria, establishing foundational transparency. **Methodological transparency** (Items 6-16) mandates detailed reporting of information sources, search strategies, study selection procedures, data extraction methods, and risk assessment protocols, enabling readers to evaluate methodological rigor and identify potential bias sources. **Results presentation** (Items 17-21) standardizes communication of study characteristics, synthesis methods, certainty of evidence assessments, and reporting bias evaluation. **Interpretation and accountability** (Items 22-27) requires transparent discussion of findings' implications, study limitations, funding sources, and protocol registration. The checklist implicitly concludes that adherence to these 27 items substantially improves systematic review quality, credibility, and utility while preventing publication bias and selective outcome reporting.

## Methodology/Approach

PRISMA 2020 employs a **normative-prescriptive approach** grounded in evidence-based consensus development. The framework utilizes iterative refinement, incorporating lessons from PRISMA 2009 and evolving systematic review practices across disciplines. Its modular structure accommodates specialized applications through separate checklists addressing abstracts, protocols, and specific review types (network meta-analyses, scoping reviews, qualitative syntheses). The methodology assumes that standardized reporting mechanisms enhance research quality through enforced methodological transparency and accountability. Implementation guidance accompanying each checklist item clarifies its rationale, application context, and relationship to research integrity. This prescriptive structure functions as a quality assurance mechanism enabling journals, funders, and institutions to evaluate and enforce minimum reporting standards.

## Relevant Concepts

**Transparency Imperative**: The foundational principle that systematic reviews require standardized reporting to enable external evaluation, replication, and critical appraisal across studies and disciplines.

**Structural Completeness**: Comprehensive documentation across defined sections ensures methodological rigor, prevents selective reporting bias, and establishes accountability for methodological decisions.

**Accessibility Framework**: Standardized checklists facilitate reader comprehension and enable consistent critical appraisal by establishing predictable reporting structures and terminology.

**Meta-Methodological Governance**: PRISMA occupies a governance role within evidence synthesis, shaping how scientific knowledge is synthesized and communicated rather than generating substantive empirical findings.

**Consensus-Driven Authority**: PRISMA 2020 derives legitimacy from stakeholder consensus and institutional adoption, functioning as normative infrastructure rather than empirically validated methodology.

**Prevention of Reporting Bias**: Explicit documentation requirements prevent selective outcome reporting, publication bias, and methodological opacity that compromise evidence synthesis integrity.

## Significance

PRISMA 2020 holds transformative significance within contemporary scientific practice and evidence-based medicine. It functions as the gold standard for systematic review reporting, achieving near-universal adoption by major journals (Cochrane, JAMA, Lancet), funding agencies (NIH, Wellcome Trust), and research institutions globally. The checklist operationalizes quality assurance mechanisms that prevent inadequately documented reviews from entering the evidence base, thereby protecting research integrity. By standardizing knowledge synthesis processes, PRISMA 2020 supports the broader evidence-based medicine movement, enhancing reliability and accessibility of synthesized evidence across healthcare, social sciences, and policy domains. Its evolving framework demonstrates responsiveness to emerging methodological challenges, including network meta-analyses, living reviews, and qualitative syntheses. Critically, PRISMA 2020 prevents selective reporting bias and publication bias by mandating transparent documentation of methodological decisions, search strategies, and outcome reporting. Ultimately, PRISMA 2020 represents consensus-driven governance infrastructure that fundamentally shapes how scientific knowledge is synthesized, evaluated, and communicated, making it foundational to evidence-based practice and research integrity across multiple disciplines.
