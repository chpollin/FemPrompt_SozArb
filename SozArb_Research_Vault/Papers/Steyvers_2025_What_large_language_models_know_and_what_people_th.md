## Abstract

High-impact study investigating mismatch between LLMs' confidence and users' trust. Found users often over-trust LLM answers, especially with explanations. Longer, detailed explanations increased user confidence even when answers weren't more accurate. Demonstrated that prompt engineering to convey uncertainty accurately helps users calibrate trust better. Aligning explanation with model's true confidence narrowed "calibration gap," improving accuracy in judging when to trust AI.
