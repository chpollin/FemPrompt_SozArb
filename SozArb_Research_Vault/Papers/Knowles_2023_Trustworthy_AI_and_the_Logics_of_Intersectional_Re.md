## Abstract

Critically examines mainstream "Trustworthy AI" frameworks from an intersectional feminist perspective, arguing that traditional AI ethics often privilege dominant groups and fail marginalized communities. Suggests reframing trustworthy AI principles to incorporate stewardship, care, humility, and empowerment, addressing intersectional injustices through power-sharing and structural change.
