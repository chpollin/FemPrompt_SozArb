## Abstract

This study investigates how 21 state-of-the-art LLMs make social and moral judgments about cooperative behavior. Using an evolutionary game-theory model and a dataset of 43,200 prompts, the authors find significant variation in how different models assign reputations, particularly when judging interactions with "ill-reputed" actors. Demonstrates that LLM social norms are highly malleable and can be consistently steered by different types of prompt interventions.
