## Abstract

Explores tensions between training social workers for technologically-driven environments and engaging students in critical theories acknowledging unequal power distributions that technological change reinforces. Introduces algorithmic literacy centered on understanding critical limitations of algorithmic decision-making systems. Argues that adding social work subjects on ADM alone proves insufficient; students need opportunities to develop algorithmic literacy enabling them to ask appropriate questions and understand what is at stake with ADM normalization.
