## Abstract

Provides an overview of various social biases manifested by large language models and discusses their root causes. Examines how training data selection leads to bias and surveys different types of biases including gender, racial/ethnic, sexual orientation, age, religious and cultural biases. Compiles an inventory of biased behaviors and discusses emerging approaches to measure and mitigate such biases.
