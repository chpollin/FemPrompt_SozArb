## Abstract

Qualitative study with 25 interviews exploring how users of different gender identities perceive bias and trustworthiness in ChatGPT. Found perceived biases in LLM outputs undermine user trust, with non-binary participants encountering stereotyped responses that eroded confidence. Trust levels varied by group with male participants reporting higher trust. Participants recommended bias mitigation strategies including diversifying training data and implementing clarifying follow-up prompts to check biases.
