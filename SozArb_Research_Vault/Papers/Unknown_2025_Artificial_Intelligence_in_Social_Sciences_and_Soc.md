## Abstract

This review explores the transformative role of artificial intelligence (AI) in the fields of social sciences and social work, with a focus on developments from 2022 to 2025. It examines how AI technologies—such as machine learning, natural language processing—enhance the analysis of complex social phenomena, support real-time forecasting, and inform data-driven policymaking. Within social work and human services, AI-driven tools facilitate case management, mental health interventions, crisis response, and resource allocation. While acknowledging AI's potential to improve equity and access, the article critically engages with ethical concerns around algorithmic bias, privacy, surveillance, and the erosion of human-centered care. Drawing on recent policy frameworks like the EU AI Act and UNESCO's AI Ethics Guidelines, the review calls for interdisciplinary collaboration to ensure the ethical, inclusive, and accountable integration of AI in social contexts.
