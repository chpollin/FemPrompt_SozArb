## Abstract

This study examines the integration of training components in co-creation processes with vulnerable and marginalized stakeholder groups as part of developing AI bias detection and mitigation tools. The research shows that training on AI definitions, terminology, and socio-technical impacts is necessary to enable non-technical stakeholders to clearly articulate their insights on AI fairness. The authors emphasize the importance of critical reflection on appropriate use of training in co-creation approaches and their design and implementation for a truly more inclusive approach to AI system design.
