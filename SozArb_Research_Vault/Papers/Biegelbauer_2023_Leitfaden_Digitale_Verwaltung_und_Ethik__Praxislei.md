## Abstract

This guideline defines AI literacy as the ability to understand and use AI, emphasizing that safe, self-determined, and responsible use requires sufficient understanding of the technology's functioning, possibilities, and challenges. It identifies automation bias as a central risk and emphasizes competency building and training as the foundation for all further measures, recommending the creation of educational standards for AI procurement and application.


## AI Summary

## Overview

The Austrian government's "Guide for Digital Administration and Ethics" (Version 1.0, 2023) represents an institutional policy document establishing frameworks for integrating artificial intelligence and digital technologies into public administration while maintaining ethical standards and democratic accountability. Published by the Federal Ministry for Art, Culture, Public Service and Sport, this guide addresses the accelerating digital transformation of governmental institutions through a normative-prescriptive approach. The document's foundational premise positions digitalization not as a purely technical challenge but as fundamentally an ethical and governance question requiring explicit institutional coordination. Significantly, the Version 1.0 designation indicates iterative development with ongoing feedback mechanisms, reflecting the document's role as a living framework rather than static guidance. The guide emphasizes comprehensive ("flächendeckend") application across all administrative levels, ensuring universal rather than selective digitalization governance.

## Main Findings

The guide establishes that responsible digital administration requires five interconnected elements. First, ethical frameworks must be embedded within technological implementation processes—digitalization cannot proceed autonomously from explicit ethical standards and transparency mechanisms. Second, citizen control over personal data ("Kontrolle über die eigenen Daten") and governmental transparency constitute foundational prerequisites for legitimate digital governance, distinguishing between political transparency and algorithmic transparency. Third, digital transformation presents a dual nature: simultaneously offering efficiency gains and citizen-proximity service improvements ("bürgernäher") while presenting ethical and legal challenges requiring proactive governance. Fourth, algorithmic decision-making in public administration demands explicit transparency enabling citizens to understand automated system impacts. Fifth, successful implementation depends on institutional capacity-building ensuring public servants possess competencies navigating complex ethical-technical terrain. The Vice Chancellor's foreword emphasizes that digitalization "richtig verstanden" (properly understood) requires human-centered approaches prioritizing citizen agency over technical optimization.

## Methodology/Approach

The document employs a **normative-prescriptive methodology** combining multidisciplinary expertise with governmental institutional authority. The authorship team comprises academics (PD Dr. Peter Biegelbauer as project lead), policy specialists, and administrative practitioners, reflecting deliberate integration of theoretical and practical perspectives. Rather than conducting empirical research, the guide synthesizes legal, ethical, and administrative knowledge into actionable guidance. The theoretical framework draws from governance ethics, digital governance theory, and human-centered design principles. Notably, the document establishes contact mechanisms (ralf.tatto@bmkoes.gv.at) for ongoing feedback, indicating commitment to iterative refinement. This methodology prioritizes practitioner applicability while maintaining grounding in established governance theory and international standards (EU AI Act, OECD recommendations).

## Relevant Concepts

**Ethical Governance**: Systematic integration of ethical principles into institutional decision-making, ensuring technology serves democratic values rather than purely technical efficiency.

**Data Sovereignty**: Citizens' fundamental right to control personal information and understand governmental usage, constituting a prerequisite for legitimate digital administration.

**Human-Centered Digitalization ("Menschenzentrierter Ansatz")**: Technology implementation prioritizing citizen needs, democratic participation, and human dignity over technical optimization, requiring citizen control and transparency.

**Citizen-Proximity ("Bürgernähe")**: Austrian administrative value emphasizing service delivery accessibility and responsiveness to citizen needs through digital means.

**Political and Algorithmic Transparency**: Dual requirement that both governmental decision-making processes and automated systems be comprehensible and subject to democratic oversight.

**Institutional Responsibility**: Government's obligation to establish regulatory frameworks ensuring both technological effectiveness and ethical correctness, with comprehensive application across administrative levels.

**Preventive Governance**: Proactive establishment of ethical guardrails before widespread AI deployment, rather than reactive management of technological failures.

## Significance

This guide occupies strategic importance within contemporary governance discourse at multiple levels. Institutionally, it demonstrates Austrian governmental commitment to responsible AI implementation aligned with international standards while addressing implementation gaps in digital governance. The document's Version 1.0 status and feedback mechanisms indicate recognition that digital ethics frameworks require ongoing refinement—a sophisticated acknowledgment of complexity often absent from policy documents. Methodologically, the guide models how governments can integrate theoretical ethics with practical administration through multidisciplinary collaboration. Substantively, it challenges technocratic approaches treating digitalization as value-neutral by positioning ethics as foundational rather than supplementary. The emphasis on citizen-proximity and data sovereignty reflects distinctly Austrian administrative values while contributing to broader European discourse on democratic accountability in technological societies. The preventive orientation—addressing ethical challenges before deployment—represents emerging best practice influencing policy development across administrations. Finally, the document's legitimization of public sector caution regarding AI adoption establishes that responsible governance sometimes requires deliberate implementation constraints, countering narratives of inevitable technological acceleration.
