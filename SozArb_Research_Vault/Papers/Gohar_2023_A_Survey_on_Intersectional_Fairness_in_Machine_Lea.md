## Abstract

Comprehensive survey examining intersectional fairness in machine learning systems beyond traditional binary fairness approaches. Presents taxonomy of intersectional fairness concepts showing how multiple sensitive attributes interact to create unique discrimination forms. Identifies challenges including data sparsity for intersectional groups and bias mitigation complexity. Demonstrates applications in NLP systems, ranking algorithms, and image recognition. Shows traditional fairness metrics fail for intersectional identities as Black women experience different discrimination than Black people or women separately.
