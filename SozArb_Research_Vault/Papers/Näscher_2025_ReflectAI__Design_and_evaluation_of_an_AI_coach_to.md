## Abstract

Design science research presenting ReflectAI, an LLM-based AI coach designed to support public servants in developing self-reflection competencies—critical skill for digital transformation in public administration. Two-week user study with seven public servants revealed three key benefits: increased awareness of self-reflection opportunities, improved thought structure, and valuable conversation documentation. Demonstrates how conversational AI can facilitate reflective practice through structured prompting and dialogue. Shows AI coaching for personality-related competencies, demonstrating how prompt-based interactions can support professional development in human services contexts closely aligned with social services.
