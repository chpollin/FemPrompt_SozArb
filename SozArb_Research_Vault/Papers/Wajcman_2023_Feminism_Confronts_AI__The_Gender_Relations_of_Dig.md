## Abstract

Wajcman and Young provide a feminist critique of AI, arguing that the technology is not neutral but deeply embedded in existing gendered power structures. They highlight the severe underrepresentation of women in AI development as a key source of bias, leading to the creation of systems that reflect and amplify a masculine worldview. The authors contend that simply adding more women to the field is insufficient. Instead, they call for a fundamental shift in the culture of technology production, challenging the technical-social dualism and integrating feminist perspectives into the very design of AI. This requires addressing the structural power asymmetries that shape technological development and moving beyond individualistic solutions.
