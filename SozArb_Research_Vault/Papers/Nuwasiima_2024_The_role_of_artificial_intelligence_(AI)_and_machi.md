## Abstract

This comprehensive review identifies algorithmic bias as a critical challenge in social work AI implementation, noting that algorithms trained on historical data may perpetuate existing inequalities by replicating racial, gender, and socio-economic disparities. The authors document specific cases where predictive analytics tools disproportionately flagged families of color for child welfare interventions despite lacking substantial evidence of higher abuse rates. The study emphasizes that addressing algorithmic bias requires multi-faceted approaches including diverse and inclusive datasets, ongoing evaluation and auditing of AI systems, and involvement of social workers and community members in AI tool development.
