## Abstract

This study evaluates 12 prompt strategies across five LLMs, finding that instructing a model to adopt a System 2 (deliberative) reasoning style and a "human persona" most effectively reduces stereotypes. Combining these two strategies yielded up to a 13% reduction in stereotypical responses. Contrary to prior assumptions, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting alone was not as effective, showing bias levels similar to a default prompt. The results suggest that prompts encouraging careful, human-like reasoning are key for mitigating bias.
