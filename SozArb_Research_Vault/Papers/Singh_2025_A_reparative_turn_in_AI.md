## Abstract

Argues for a "reparative turn" in AI governance, moving beyond harm prevention to focus on remedying harm after it occurs. Based on thematic analysis of 1,060 real-world AI harm incidents, proposes taxonomy of reparative actions around four goals: acknowledging harm, attributing responsibility, providing remedies, and enabling systemic change. Finds significant "accountability gap" with most corporate responses limited to symbolic acknowledgments.
