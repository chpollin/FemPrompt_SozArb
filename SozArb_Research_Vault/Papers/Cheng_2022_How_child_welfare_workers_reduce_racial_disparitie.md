## Abstract

Mixed-methods study analyzing four years of child welfare call screening data alongside worker interviews to investigate how human-algorithm collaboration affects racial bias in decision-making. Demonstrates Allegheny Family Screening Tool algorithm alone would have created 20% disparity in screen-in rates between Black and white children, but workers reduced this to 9% through holistic risk assessments and adjustments for algorithmic limitations. Reveals critical discrimination risks: algorithm disproportionately flags Black families for investigation due to biased training data reflecting historical over-policing and surveillance of communities of color.
