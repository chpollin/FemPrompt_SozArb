## Abstract

Multi-year art-research project directly addresses critical prompting practices by interrogating every AI development step—data collection, labeling, training, algorithm selection, and chatbot design—through feminist and intersectional lenses. Conducts public workshops to collaboratively build feminist datasets. Represents concrete critical prompting practice through community-based data creation as protest against biased AI systems, demonstrating practical approaches to feminist prompting by creating alternative training data.
