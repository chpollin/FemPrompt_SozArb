## Abstract

This study provides a theoretical and methodological framework for making bias visible in AI models and datasets. It introduces the concept of "positionality" - the assumption that developers' social, cultural, and political perspectives inevitably flow into AI artifacts. The authors develop a method to quantify design biases by analyzing which dialects, demographic groups, or social contexts are under- or over-represented in datasets.
