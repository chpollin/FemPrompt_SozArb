## Abstract

Foundation models are the backbone of generative AI and thus central to applications such as ChatGPT, Gemini, or Copilot. However, their use comes with risks: from randomly compiled training data and opaque processes to profit-driven business models. The new report Fragile Foundations: Hidden Risks of Generative AI by the Bertelsmann Stiftung shows why mission-driven organizations in particular should critically question the foundations of AI. It highlights the systemic weaknesses of foundation models, the dangers they pose to vulnerable groups, and the possible alternatives. This report illustrates why it is critical to scrutinize foundation models. It thus offers a starting point and impetus for decision-makers and practitioners in mission-driven organizations, as well as anyone committed to a responsible digital future. Using generative AI meaningfully in the service of the common good requires a clear understanding of the technology’s foundations –and of the questions these raise for mission-driven organizations.
