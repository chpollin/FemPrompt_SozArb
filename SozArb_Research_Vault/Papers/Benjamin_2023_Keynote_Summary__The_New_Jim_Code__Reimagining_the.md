## Abstract

In this summary of her foundational work, Ruha Benjamin introduces the concept of the "New Jim Code," which describes how new technologies, including AI, can reproduce and even deepen existing racial hierarchies and discrimination under a veneer of neutrality and progress. She argues that discrimination becomes embedded in the very architecture of these systems. This framework is crucial for understanding how various forms of discrimination are co-constituted in AI, not as accidental bugs, but as features of a system designed within a society that has not resolved its structural inequalities. The concept inherently critiques individual competence, showing how even well-intentioned developers can create discriminatory systems if the underlying societal "default settings" are not challenged.
