## Abstract

Critical empirical study examining child protection decision support algorithm deployed in Danish municipalities, analyzing its biases and implementation challenges. Using real administrative data from Denmark's child welfare system, evaluated algorithm's predictions against actual case outcomes and found significant biases including disproportionate impacts on immigrant families and systematic errors in risk assessment. Results revealed concerning patterns of false positives for marginalized communities and questioned algorithm's validity for high-stakes decision-making. Documents actual harms from deployed systems.
