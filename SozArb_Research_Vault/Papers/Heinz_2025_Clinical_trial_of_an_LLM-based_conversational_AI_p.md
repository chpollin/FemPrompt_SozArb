## Abstract

Groundbreaking study representing first randomized controlled trial of generative AI-powered therapy chatbot, Therabot. Trial included 106 participants across United States diagnosed with major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, or eating disorders. Participants interacted with Therabot via smartphone app over 4-8 weeks. Results showed clinically significant symptom improvements: 51% reduction in depression symptoms, 31% reduction in anxiety symptoms, and 19% reduction in eating disorder concerns, with outcomes comparable to traditional outpatient therapy. Participants reported therapeutic alliance levels comparable to human therapists and engaged average of 6 hours (equivalent to 8 therapy sessions).
