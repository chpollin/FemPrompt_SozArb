## Abstract

This open-access paper provides a comprehensive overview of fairness in AI, bridging technical bias mitigation methods with legal and policy considerations. Alvarez et al. survey the state-of-the-art in fair AI techniques and review major policy initiatives and standards on algorithmic bias. A key contribution is the NoBIAS architecture introduced in the paper, which comprises a “Legal Layer” (focusing on EU non-discrimination law and human rights requirements) and a “Bias Management Layer” (covering bias understanding, mitigation, and accountability). The authors note that AI systems have produced real-world harms, including illegal discrimination against protected groups, and they highlight challenges such as intersectional discrimination that current EU law does not explicitly address. By organizing existing knowledge and best practices, the article guides researchers and practitioners in aligning technical solutions with ethical and legal norms – underscoring that managing AI bias requires not just algorithmic techniques but also adherence to equality principles and governance frameworks.
