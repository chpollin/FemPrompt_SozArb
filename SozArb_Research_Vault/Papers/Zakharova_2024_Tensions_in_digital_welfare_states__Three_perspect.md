## Abstract

Examines tensions between care and control in digital welfare states, analyzing how welfare services increasingly rely on digital technologies and data systems. Develops three analytical perspectives: datafied care practices, algorithmic governance, and digitalized welfare encounters. Demonstrates how digitalization reshapes welfare provision by intensifying surveillance while potentially enabling new forms of care. Reveals fundamental contradictions where care logics and control logics coexist uneasily.
