## Abstract

Critical analysis examining fairness and justice implications of predictive algorithms in child protection from both statistical and social justice perspectives. Identifies fundamental problems with using child protection system data: biased sample frames reflecting reporting patterns rather than actual abuse incidence, feedback loops amplifying discrimination, and spurious correlations conflating system surveillance with genuine risk. Demonstrates racial and socioeconomic disparities in child welfare data lead to algorithmic tools disproportionately identifying Indigenous, Black, and poor families as high risk even when true abuse rates are similar across groups.
