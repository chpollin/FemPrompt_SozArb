## Abstract

Investigates trust-adaptive interventions to reduce inappropriate reliance on AI recommendations in decision-support tasks. Argues that AI assistants should adapt behavior based on user trust to mitigate both under- and over-trust. In two decision scenarios shows that providing supportive explanations for low trust and counter-explanations for high trust leads to 38% reduction in inappropriate reliance and 20% improvement in decision accuracy. Demonstrates that adaptive insertion of forced pauses to promote deliberation reduces over-trust, opening new paths for improved human-AI collaboration.
