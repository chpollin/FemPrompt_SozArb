## Abstract

Investigates how large language models represent queer individuals in generated narratives, uncovering tendencies toward stereotyped and narrow portrayals. Identifies phenomena including narrow topic range, discursive othering, and identity foregrounding. Shows LLMs unconsciously reinforce divide where marginalized groups are not afforded same breadth of narrative roles as others.
