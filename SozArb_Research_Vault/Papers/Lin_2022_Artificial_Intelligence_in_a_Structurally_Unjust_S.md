## Abstract

This study argues that AI bias represents a form of structural injustice that arises when AI systems interact with other social factors to exacerbate existing social inequalities. Using the example of AI in healthcare, the authors show that the goal of AI fairness is to strive for a more just social structure through appropriate development and use of AI systems. They argue that all actors involved in the unjust social structure bear shared responsibility to join collective actions for structural reform and offer practical recommendations for various social positions.
