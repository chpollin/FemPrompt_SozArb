## Abstract

Qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with 19 individuals from 8 countries who used generative AI chatbots (primarily Pi, ChatGPT) for mental health support in real-world settings. Participants reported high engagement and positive impacts including improved relationships, healing from trauma and loss, and improved mood. Four themes emerged: emotional sanctuary (non-judgmental, always-available support), insightful guidance particularly for relationships, joy of connection, and comparisons with human therapy. Some participants described life-changing impacts. Identified challenges including frustrating safety guardrails disrupting emotional sanctuary, limited memory capabilities, and inability to lead therapeutic process.
