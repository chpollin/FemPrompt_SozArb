## Abstract

Narrative review examining interplay between gender bias in AI systems and digital literacy potential for empowering women in technology. Synthesizes research from 2010-2024 analyzing systematic gender biases in AI applications across recruitment, healthcare, and financial services. These biases stem from women's underrepresentation in AI development teams (only 22% globally), biased training data, and algorithmic design decisions. Digital literacy programs show promise as intervention fostering critical awareness of AI bias, encouraging women toward AI careers, and catalyzing growth of women-led AI projects.
