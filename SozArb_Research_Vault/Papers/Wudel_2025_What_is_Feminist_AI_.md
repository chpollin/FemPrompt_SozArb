## Abstract

Defines Feminist AI (FAI) as framework using intersectional feminism to address bias and inequalities in AI systems. Emphasizes interdisciplinary collaboration, systemic power analysis, and iterative theory-practice loops. Embeds feminist values of equality, freedom, and justice to transform AI development. Includes practical applications like FemAI advocacy for feminist perspectives in EU AI Act and MIRA diagnostic platform aligning AI tools with social justice goals. Distinguishes FAI from traditional "Responsible AI" approaches through focus on structural power inequalities rather than individual "bad actors."
