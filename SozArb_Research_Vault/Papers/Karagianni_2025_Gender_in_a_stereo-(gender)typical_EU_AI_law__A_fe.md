## Abstract

This peer-reviewed article offers a feminist critique of the European Union’s AI Act, arguing that the law’s current bias mitigation provisions only superficially address gendered risks and fail to confront deeply embedded structural biases. Using frameworks like hermeneutical injustice and feminist legal theory, Karagianni shows that AI systems can perpetuate historical power imbalances and systemic discrimination against women and marginalized groups. The AI Act’s pre-market and post-market measures are analyzed to reveal how they often reinforce, rather than challenge, algorithmic discrimination. The author concludes that effective AI governance must go beyond technical fixes, incorporating an intersectional perspective and substantive equality principles. She calls for feminist-informed revisions to the AI Act – emphasizing gender inclusivity, intersectionality, and accountability – to ensure AI regulation actively dismantles (instead of inadvertently upholding) existing power asymmetries.
