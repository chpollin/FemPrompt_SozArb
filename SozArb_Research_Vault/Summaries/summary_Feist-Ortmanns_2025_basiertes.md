# Summary: Feist-Ortmanns 2025 basiertes

## Overview

This academic document critically examines the integration of digital technologies and artificial intelligence within German child and youth welfare services (Kinder- und Jugendhilfe), arguing that current approaches conflate digitalization with digitality, obscuring fundamental tensions in how technology reshapes professional practice and institutional decision-making. The work resists both techno-optimism and technological determinism, instead positioning digital systems as autonomous actors whose agency remains inadequately theorized in welfare contexts. By synthesizing critical digital sociology with social pedagogy, the analysis reveals a critical institutional gap: digitalization initiatives fail to recognize or leverage existing digital practices within service users' lifeworlds, while simultaneously eroding analytical differentials that structure professional-client relationships. The document emphasizes that rapid AI development (1950-2024) significantly outpaces institutional capacity for reflexive integration, particularly in child protection domains requiring transparent, human-centered judgment.

## Main Findings

The document identifies five critical findings. First, digitalization and digitality constitute distinct phenomena: digitalization involves implementing discrete digital tools (case management systems, online counseling), while digitality encompasses everyday practices integrating digital materiality into lived experience and professional culture. Second, current discourse exhibits one-sided, normative approaches to digital technology's opportunities and risks, systematically overlooking how professional cultures negotiate digitality's meaning and institutional implementation. Third, service user narratives reveal that digitalized help-planning conversations reinforce deficit-focused institutional practices rather than transforming them toward strength-based, participatory approaches—users report experiencing interactions centered on compliance and sanctions rather than genuine inquiry ("Wie geht es dir? Brauchst du was?"). Fourth, digital technologies function as autonomous actors possessing "unclear agency" (ungeklärte Agency), complicating traditional professional decision-making frameworks and potentially obscuring rather than clarifying institutional judgments, particularly in child protection contexts. Fifth, digitalization erodes analytical differentials previously structuring counseling relationships: raum-zeitliche Strukturierung (spatio-temporal structuring), Akteur:innenschaft (agency of professionals and service users), and the role of complex interactive digital systems remain theoretically unresolved.

## Methodology/Approach

The document employs critical conceptual analysis grounded in social pedagogy, drawing on Stalder's (2016) materiality-centered approach to digitality (emphasizing "zuhandene Dinge"—ready-to-hand things), Weinhardt's (2021, 2022) "Doing Digitality" framework conceptualizing digitality as active practice rather than static condition, and critical perspectives (Distelmeyer 2021) questioning techno-optimistic narratives. The analysis incorporates qualitative evidence from service user narratives, providing empirical grounding for theoretical arguments. The lifeworld perspective—central to social pedagogical tradition—structures inquiry, emphasizing how digital systems reshape lived experiences of professionals and service users. The methodology treats technology as constitutive of social practice rather than instrumental tool, requiring reflexive analysis of how digital systems participate in institutional relations and professional cultures.

## Relevant Concepts

**Digitality:** Everyday practices and lived experiences integrating digital materiality; encompasses hybrid cultures and ready-to-hand digital things; distinct from digitalization as technical implementation.

**Digitalization:** Institutional adoption of discrete digital tools and systems for administrative and service delivery purposes; often fails to recognize existing digitality within service users' lifeworlds.

**Doing Digitality:** Active, ongoing practice of negotiating digital and hybrid cultures as everyday social performance, rather than passive technology adoption.

**Agency of Digital Things (Ungeklärte Agency):** Recognition that complex interactive digital systems possess autonomous effects and decision-making capacity beyond professional control or intention, requiring theoretical clarification.

**Analytical Differentials:** Structural elements previously organizing professional-client relationships—spatio-temporal structuring, professional agency, service user agency—that digitalization erodes without replacement.

**Professional Culture:** Institutional norms and practices shaping how professionals interpret, negotiate, and implement digital technologies; mediates relationship between digitalization initiatives and actual practice.

**Lifeworld Perspective:** Social pedagogical emphasis on service users' lived experiences, existing digital practices, and everyday contexts as analytical starting points and resources.

## Significance

This work contributes significantly to critical digital sociology and social welfare scholarship by establishing "Digitalität" as an essential analytical category for understanding digitalization's constitutive role in institutional practice. The document's central contribution lies in demonstrating that digitalization initiatives risk reinforcing problematic institutional practices (deficit-focus, compliance-orientation) while simultaneously obscuring professional decision-making through unclear technological agency. For practitioners, it highlights risks that digitalization may erode rather than enhance professional judgment and service user participation. For policymakers, it demonstrates necessity of reflexive, culturally-attentive approaches recognizing professional cultures as mediating variables. The emphasis on service user lifeworld perspectives addresses contemporary social justice concerns regarding how digital systems reproduce institutional inequalities. Critically, the document argues that meaningful digitalization requires genuine engagement with existing digital practices within service users' lifeworlds, sustained attention to how professional cultures negotiate technology's role, and explicit theoretical work clarifying the agency of complex interactive digital systems—particularly in child protection contexts where transparency and human-centered judgment remain ethically paramount.
