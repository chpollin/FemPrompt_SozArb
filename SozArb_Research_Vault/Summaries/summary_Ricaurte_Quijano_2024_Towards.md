# Summary: Towards Substantive Equality in Artificial Intelligence

## Overview
This GPAI report addresses how AI systems perpetuate and magnify existing societal inequalities, disproportionately harming marginalized communities globally. The research gap centers on the disconnect between AI access and meaningful inclusion—mere technological availability does not translate to equitable participation or benefit distribution. The report's main thesis argues that transformative AI governance requires centering marginalized communities' experiences throughout development and decision-making lifecycles, moving beyond surface-level diversity initiatives toward substantive equality frameworks that address systemic barriers in design, governance, and resource distribution.

## Main Findings

1. **Access ≠ Inclusion**: Providing access to AI technologies differs fundamentally from ensuring meaningful participation. Marginalized groups remain excluded from decision-making roles despite increased technological access, requiring systemic transformation rather than incremental inclusion efforts.

2. **Epistemic Injustice in AI Models**: AI systems perpetuate knowledge exclusion through underrepresentation of diverse perspectives and incompatibility with non-dominant knowledge systems, particularly affecting Global Majority and Indigenous communities whose ontologies are systematically devalued.

3. **Unbalanced Resource Distribution**: Marginalized communities are systematically excluded from AI economy gains while experiencing labor exploitation, data extractivism, and environmental injustice disproportionately affecting their regions.

4. **Four-Pillar Policy Framework Required**: Effective governance demands (1) inclusive design with affirmative action and feminist technology principles, (2) meaningful participation mechanisms with ex ante rights, (3) transparency and accountability systems, and (4) accessible justice mechanisms for AI-related harms.

5. **Structural Barriers Persist Beyond Recruitment**: Simply hiring diverse staff is insufficient; organizations must create welcoming environments, represent diverse datasets, fund participation mechanisms, and implement institutional dialogue with marginalized communities.

## Methodology/Approach
The research employed multi-regional consultations engaging approximately 200 participants from 50+ countries across academia, civil society, industry, and government. Methods combined stakeholder consultations, desk research, and literature reviews emphasizing localized expertise. Two complementary initiatives—Design from the Margins (community-based research centering "decentred users") and the Feminist AI Research Network (100+ multidisciplinary academics and activists)—grounded analysis in marginalized communities' lived experiences throughout AI lifecycles. The framework prioritized harm reduction and substantive equality perspectives, ensuring that those most impacted by AI injustice shaped recommendations.

## Relevant Concepts

**Substantive Equality:** Moving beyond formal equality (equal treatment) to address systemic barriers and historical disadvantages, requiring intentional structural changes that center marginalized communities' needs and experiences.

**Epistemic Injustice:** The systematic exclusion of certain groups' knowledge, perspectives, and ways of knowing from decision-making processes, resulting in AI systems that devalue non-dominant ontologies and knowledge systems.

**Design from the Margins:** A research and development approach that centers the experiences and expertise of marginalized communities as primary stakeholders, not afterthoughts, throughout technology development.

**Data Extractivism:** The exploitative practice of extracting data from marginalized communities without consent, compensation, or benefit-sharing, perpetuating colonial patterns of resource extraction.

**Meaningful Participation:** Beyond consultation, genuine decision-making power for marginalized communities with adequate resources, capacity building, and institutional support to influence AI governance outcomes.

**Feminist Technology Design:** Development approaches that explicitly challenge patriarchal structures, center care and interdependence, and prioritize harm reduction for historically excluded groups.

**Harm Reduction Framework:** Policy approach focusing on minimizing negative impacts on vulnerable populations rather than pursuing idealized solutions, acknowledging real-world constraints and community priorities.

## Practical Implications

**For Social Workers:**
- Advocate for marginalized clients' participation in AI governance consultations affecting their communities, providing accessible support for meaningful engagement.
- Screen AI-based social services (algorithmic case management, benefit determination) for discriminatory outcomes disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations.

**For Organizations:**
- Implement affirmative action in AI teams beyond recruitment, ensuring diverse staff have decision-making power and resources for capacity building.
- Conduct bias testing with affected communities before deploying AI systems, incorporating feedback into iterative design cycles.

**For Policymakers:**
- Establish ex ante participation rights requiring marginalized communities' involvement in AI governance before implementation, with dedicated funding for capacity building and institutional dialogue.
- Create accessible justice mechanisms for AI-related harms, particularly for communities lacking legal resources.

**For Researchers:**
- Center marginalized communities' epistemologies and knowledge systems in AI research design, moving beyond extractive consultation models.
- Evaluate AI interventions' substantive equality outcomes, not merely access metrics.

## Limitations & Open Questions

**Limitations:**
- Research represents an overview rather than comprehensive documentation of all participants' nuanced perspectives across diverse contexts.
- Practical initiatives face funding dependency on grants and corporate contributions, limiting sustainability and independence.
- No evaluation metrics or outcome data provided for proposed policy interventions.
- Scope focuses specifically on gender equality and diversity while acknowledging broader human rights interconnections remain underexplored.

**Open Questions:**
- How can participation mechanisms remain accessible and genuinely influential amid rapid AI commercialization pressures?
- What evaluation frameworks effectively measure substantive equality outcomes versus surface-level diversity metrics?
- How do regional legal and cultural contexts require adaptation of proposed governance frameworks?

## Relation to Other Research

- **AI Ethics & Governance:** This work advances beyond principle-based approaches toward concrete policy mechanisms centering marginalized communities' participation and accountability.
- **Epistemic Justice & Knowledge Systems:** Connects AI bias research to broader philosophical frameworks examining how technology perpetuates systematic exclusion of non-dominant knowledge.
- **Global Development & Digital Equity:** Links AI governance to sustainable development goals and historical patterns of technology-enabled colonialism and resource extraction.
- **Feminist Technology Studies:** Grounds AI policy in feminist praxis emphasizing care, interdependence, and structural transformation rather than incremental inclusion.

## Significance
This report provides transformative guidance for preventing AI advancement from exacerbating systemic discrimination affecting Global Majority and historically excluded communities. By centering marginalized communities' experiences and proposing concrete four-pillar governance frameworks, it moves beyond aspirational diversity statements toward actionable policy change. The research demonstrates that designing for those most impacted by injustice benefits everyone, making substantive equality both ethically imperative and pragmatically sound. As AI rapidly evolves, sustained commitment across technological, legal, and financial domains remains essential for ensuring equitable futures.
