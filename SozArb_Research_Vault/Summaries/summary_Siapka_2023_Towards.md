# Summary: Siapka 2023 Towards

## Overview

Anastasia Siapka's paper identifies a fundamental paradox in contemporary AI ethics: despite overwhelming proliferation of ethical guidelines, boards, codes of conduct, and dedicated journals across multiple disciplines (law, philosophy, computer science, policy, industry), the field lacks systematic self-examination. The author argues that AI ethics scholarship has become predominantly theory-focused, analyzing competing principles and values for AI development without critically evaluating the field's own institutional practices, practitioner composition, and measurable real-world impacts. This oversight is particularly problematic given recent incidents involving AI ethicists themselves, demonstrating that theoretical sophistication alone cannot ensure ethical practice. The paper proposes developing a feminist metaethics of AI—a methodologically distinct approach that shifts from abstract principle-analysis to concrete institutional accountability, power dynamics, and implementation effectiveness.

## Main Findings

The analysis reveals critical insufficiencies in current AI ethics scholarship across multiple dimensions. First, a significant theory-practice gap exists, manifested as "ethics-washing"—organizations adopting ethical frameworks without substantive behavioral change. Second, AI ethics exhibits an accountability asymmetry: ethicists evaluate AI systems while remaining unexamined themselves, creating institutional blind spots. Third, the field's proliferation of meta-analyses merely catalogs and compares frameworks without examining their actual effects on AI development or affected communities. Fourth, AI ethics overlooks how practitioner demographics, institutional hierarchies, and power relations determine which ethical concerns receive attention and whose voices are marginalized. Fifth, the field lacks systematic examination of who participates in AI ethics and how their background shapes the field's priorities. These findings collectively demonstrate that theory-centered approaches cannot address the field's structural and practical limitations.

## Methodology/Approach

The author employs feminist metaethics as a distinctive analytical framework that transcends traditional metaethics' non-normative stance. Traditional metaethics examines what morality is without prescribing how engagement should occur; feminist metaethics adds normative dimensions, asking not only what ethics is but also what ethical engagement should be like. The proposed framework systematically examines four interconnected dimensions: (1) continuity between theoretical commitments and practical actions within AI ethics; (2) measurable real-life effects of AI ethical frameworks on actual AI systems and affected communities; (3) the role, background, and profile of AI ethics practitioners and institutional composition; and (4) effects on power relations through methodologies emphasizing context-sensitivity, emotional dimensions, and narrative analysis. This approach integrates characteristic feminist philosophical methods—attention to particularity, relationality, lived experience, and structural power—into metaethical inquiry, distinguishing it from conventional philosophical approaches.

## Relevant Concepts

**Feminist Metaethics:** A philosophical approach combining metaethical reflection (examining the nature of morality itself) with normative inquiry (determining how ethical engagement should proceed), incorporating feminist epistemological commitments to contextuality, power analysis, and practitioner accountability.

**Ethics-Washing:** The adoption of ethical frameworks, language, and institutional structures without corresponding substantive changes in practice, outcomes, or power distributions—analogous to "greenwashing" in environmental discourse.

**Accountability Asymmetry:** The structural condition where AI ethics practitioners and institutions evaluate external AI systems while remaining exempt from equivalent self-scrutiny and evaluation.

**Reflexivity:** Critical self-examination of a field's own assumptions, institutional structures, practitioner composition, and effects rather than focusing exclusively on external subjects of evaluation.

**Power Relations:** Structural dynamics determining whose perspectives are valued, whose concerns are prioritized, how resources and authority are distributed, and which voices are marginalized within the AI ethics field.

**Implementation Gap:** The disconnect between theoretical ethical commitments and measurable real-world effects on AI development, deployment, and governance.

## Significance

This paper makes crucial contributions to AI ethics scholarship by initiating systematic second-order reflection on the field itself. It challenges the assumption that proliferating ethical frameworks and institutional infrastructure automatically improve AI governance. By proposing feminist metaethics as an analytical tool, Siapka provides a methodological pathway for examining institutional accountability, practitioner diversity, implementation effectiveness, and power dynamics. The work is significant for establishing that AI ethics cannot achieve legitimacy through theoretical sophistication or institutional proliferation alone; instead, the field must demonstrate reflexivity, accountability mechanisms, attention to power dynamics, and measurable real-world effects. This argument has implications for how AI ethics is institutionalized, who gains authority within the field, how practitioners are selected and evaluated, and how ethical frameworks are assessed for genuine impact rather than mere symbolic adoption. The paper contributes to emerging scholarship questioning AI ethics' legitimacy and effectiveness, establishing grounds for institutional reform.
