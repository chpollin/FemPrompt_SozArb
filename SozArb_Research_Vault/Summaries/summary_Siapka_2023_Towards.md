# Detailed Summary: Towards a Feminist Metaethics of AI

## Overview
Despite proliferating AI ethics guidelines, boards, and codes globally, the field lacks systematic self-evaluation and reflexivity. This paper identifies a critical gap: AI ethics discourse primarily analyzes competing principles and values but fails to examine whether these efforts actually improve outcomes or merely provide ethical legitimacy ("ethics-washing") while perpetuating power imbalances. The author argues that before AI ethicists evaluate others' work, they must critically examine their own profession. The thesis proposes developing a feminist metaethics of AI—examining not just what ethics is, but how we should engage with it—to address theory-practice divides, real-world effects, practitioner representation, and power dynamics in AI governance.

## Main Findings

1. **Ethics-washing is systemic**: Recent incidents (Google's ethics board dissolution, Timnit Gebru's firing, Facebook's funded research centers) demonstrate that AI ethics discourse often legitimizes corporate interests rather than constraining them, undermining the field's intellectual legitimacy.

2. **Theory-practice continuity is broken**: AI ethics outputs consist primarily of abstract principle analyses with minimal examination of whether these principles translate into actual behavioral change or organizational accountability.

3. **Democratic legitimacy is absent**: AI ethics decision-making bodies are industry-dominated, self-nominated, and lack enforcement mechanisms—ethical codes rely on voluntary compliance with only reputational consequences for violations.

4. **Geographic and demographic representation is severely limited**: Africa, South/Central America, and Central Asia are significantly underrepresented in international AI ethics discourse, reflecting and perpetuating global power inequalities.

5. **Conflicts of interest parallel tobacco industry influence**: Corporate funding of academic ethics research and industry-led ethics initiatives create structural incentives to minimize rather than address AI harms.

6. **Concept selection reflects and reinforces social structures**: The philosophical concepts chosen for AI ethics frameworks are not neutral—they embed normative assumptions that require interrogation from marginalized perspectives.

## Methodology/Approach

The paper employs feminist metaethics—a philosophical approach examining how moral judgments are reached rather than what is objectively right. Rather than proposing novel theories, it systematizes existing interdisciplinary critiques from law, ethics, science and technology studies, and feminist philosophy. The methodology prioritizes lived experience, historical context, and situated knowledge from marginalized communities over abstract theorizing. It uses narrative analysis, case studies (Google's racist image recognition, Stanford's "gaydar"), testimonies from affected agents, and science fiction as resources for moral imagination. The framework rejects ideal theory in favor of non-ideal theorization grounded in actual power dynamics and real-world consequences. Analysis emphasizes emotions, context-sensitivity, and interrogation of whose interests are served by particular ethical framings.

## Relevant Concepts

**Ethics-washing:** Using ethical language and frameworks to justify predetermined corporate behaviors while maintaining appearance of ethical consideration, without substantive constraint on harmful practices.

**Feminist Metaethics:** A philosophical approach examining not only what morality is but also how we should engage with ethics—attending to power relations, context, emotions, and the situatedness of moral agents.

**Theory-practice divide:** The gap between abstract ethical principles articulated in guidelines and their actual implementation, enforcement, or real-world effects on AI development and deployment.

**Democratic legitimacy:** The extent to which decision-making bodies represent affected populations and operate through transparent, accountable processes rather than self-appointed expertise.

**Situated knowledge:** Understanding that all knowledge claims emerge from particular social positions; perspectives from marginalized communities reveal aspects invisible to dominant groups.

**Non-ideal theory:** Ethical analysis grounded in actual historical and social conditions rather than hypothetical idealized scenarios, attending to structural injustices.

**Concept selection:** The process of choosing which philosophical frameworks and terminology guide ethical analysis—a choice that embeds normative assumptions requiring critical examination.

## Practical Implications

**For Social Workers:**
- Recognize AI ethics discourse as potentially legitimizing rather than constraining algorithmic harms; demand evidence of real-world protective effects before accepting ethical frameworks.
- Center testimonies and lived experiences of clients affected by AI systems when evaluating AI ethics initiatives, rather than deferring to expert pronouncements.

**For Organizations:**
- Move beyond ethics guidelines toward binding legal accountability mechanisms with enforcement capacity and meaningful penalties for violations.
- Ensure AI ethics practitioners include affected community members and marginalized perspectives in decision-making, not just industry-selected experts.

**For Policymakers:**
- Establish mandatory democratic representation requirements for AI ethics boards, including civil society and affected populations, not just industry and academia.
- Require transparency regarding funding sources and conflicts of interest for all AI ethics initiatives; treat corporate-funded ethics research with skepticism comparable to tobacco industry research.

**For Researchers:**
- Systematically evaluate whether AI ethics outputs produce measurable improvements in outcomes for affected populations, not just theoretical coherence.
- Interrogate your own situatedness, power, and interests before prescribing ethical frameworks for others.

## Limitations & Open Questions

**Limitations:**
- The proposed framework is broad and preliminary rather than exhaustive; substantial future research required for full development.
- Limited representation of non-Western ethical perspectives in referenced literature constrains the analysis's global applicability.
- The paper raises tensions between disciplinary integration and single-discipline approaches without fully resolving them.

**Open Questions:**
- How can feminist metaethics be operationalized into specific policy mechanisms with enforcement capacity?
- What mechanisms could ensure sustained democratic participation from marginalized communities in AI governance without reproducing extractive research practices?
- How do different cultural and philosophical traditions conceptualize AI ethics accountability differently?

## Relation to Other Research

- **Corporate influence on knowledge production:** This work connects to research on how industry funding shapes academic research agendas and constrains critical analysis, particularly in emerging technology fields.
- **Algorithmic justice and fairness:** The paper extends fairness debates by interrogating who defines fairness and whose interests are served by particular framings.
- **Feminist philosophy of technology:** Builds on feminist STS scholarship examining how technology development reflects and perpetuates power inequalities.
- **Governance and accountability mechanisms:** Relates to broader research on regulatory effectiveness, voluntary compliance limitations, and democratic legitimacy in technology governance.

## Significance

This work is significant because it reframes AI ethics from a technical problem requiring better principles into a political problem requiring structural accountability. By applying feminist metaethics, the paper reveals that proliferating ethics guidelines may actually *enable* corporate harm by providing ethical legitimacy without substantive constraint. This has immediate implications: policymakers should recognize ethics codes as insufficient compared to binding legal instruments; organizations should understand that ethics discourse without enforcement perpetuates rather than addresses inequalities; and researchers should recognize their complicity in ethics-washing if they fail to examine real-world effects and their own situatedness. The framework's emphasis on lived experience, democratic representation, and reflexivity offers a path toward AI governance that genuinely protects vulnerable populations rather than merely appearing to do so.
