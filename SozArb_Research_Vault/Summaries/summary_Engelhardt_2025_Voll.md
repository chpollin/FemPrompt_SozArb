# Detailed Summary: Generative AI in Social Work Higher Education

## Overview
German universities face urgent pedagogical challenges as generative AI tools like ChatGPT rapidly proliferate among students and faculty without established integration frameworks. This workshop report addresses a critical research gap: how to meaningfully incorporate AI into social work curricula while preserving academic integrity and developing critical thinking. Rather than adopting simplistic opportunity-risk binaries, Engelhardt and Ley propose reconceptualizing AI as collaborative non-human agents requiring curricular redesign. The authors argue that successful integration demands simultaneous attention to technical competency development, authentic professional skill-building, and rigorous academic standards—positioning educators as "learning educators" navigating transformation alongside students.

## Main Findings

1. **AI as Non-Human Agent, Not Neutral Tool:** Large Language Models function as quasi-social actors exhibiting social presence, trust-building capacity, and mutual influence dynamics—requiring fundamentally different pedagogical approaches than traditional software tools.

2. **Three Viable Application Scenarios:** Academic writing assistance (with process documentation via "prompting directories"), methodological practice partnerships (counseling simulations), and chatbot-based learning environments each serve distinct pedagogical functions with specific limitations.

3. **Prompting as Core Metacognitive Competency:** Effective AI utilization requires developing prompting competence—the ability to formulate precise instructions—as a fundamental learning outcome alongside data literacy and media-reflexivity.

4. **Twelve Documented Usage Contexts:** Research support, text analysis, programming assistance, translation, concept explanation, and problem-solving represent practical applications across social work curricula.

5. **AI Limitations Require Critical Awareness:** Systems produce "hallucinations," reproduce training data biases, and simulate competence without genuine understanding—necessitating human verification and critical evaluation.

6. **Assessment Must Evaluate Process and Product:** Traditional final-product assessment fails to capture learning value; educators must document prompting strategies and collaborative creation processes.

7. **Transformed Educator Roles:** Faculty must become architects of hybrid virtual/analog learning spaces with facilitation and navigation functions, working *with* generative AI to assess discipline-specific output quality.

## Methodology/Approach

This exploratory "workshop report" employs experience-based analysis rather than formal empirical research. Authors examined three primary application scenarios and twelve documented usage contexts for social work students, drawing on their own pedagogical experimentation. The approach emphasizes balanced utilization through critical reflection, positioning educators as active learners navigating new territory. Rather than comprehensive empirical validation, the study provides practical guidance grounded in direct institutional experience. The authors acknowledge their analysis is cursory and exploratory, focusing on three curriculum areas while recognizing rapid technological evolution may quickly date findings. Few German universities currently provide structured student AI access, limiting empirical scope.

## Relevant Concepts

**Generative AI:** Large Language Models (LLMs) that produce novel text outputs based on statistical patterns in training data, simulating human-like communication without genuine understanding.

**Prompting Competence:** The metacognitive ability to formulate effective instructions for AI systems—a fundamental skill requiring explicit pedagogical development alongside traditional academic competencies.

**Non-Human Actors:** AI systems functioning as collaborative agents with quasi-social properties (social presence, trust dynamics, mutual influence) rather than passive tools, requiring reconceptualization of human-machine relationships.

**Academic Integrity in AI Context:** Ensuring student ownership of intellectual work while leveraging AI assistance, requiring transparent documentation of AI involvement and process-oriented assessment.

**Data Literacy:** Critical understanding of AI system limitations, bias reproduction, hallucination risks, and appropriate verification procedures—essential for responsible AI utilization.

**Curricular Integration:** Embedding AI competencies across social work programs through writing instruction, methodological training, and critical evaluation of human-machine co-production.

**Hybrid Learning Spaces:** Pedagogical environments combining virtual AI-supported interactions with analog human engagement, requiring educator facilitation and intentional design.

## Practical Implications

**For Social Workers:**
- Develop prompting competence as professional skill for evidence-based practice and client documentation
- Maintain critical awareness of AI limitations and bias risks when using systems for assessment or planning
- Engage AI as practice partner for skill development (counseling simulations) while preserving authentic human interaction

**For Organizations:**
- Establish structured AI integration frameworks combining system access with mandatory competency training
- Redesign assessment methods to evaluate both final products and creation processes (prompting documentation)
- Provide faculty professional development in AI capabilities, limitations, and pedagogical applications

**For Policymakers:**
- Mandate AI competency standards in social work accreditation requirements
- Fund institutional infrastructure for equitable student AI access and training
- Support curricular innovation research documenting effective integration models

**For Researchers:**
- Investigate long-term impacts of AI-assisted learning on critical thinking and professional competency development
- Examine equity implications of AI access disparities across institutions
- Develop discipline-specific frameworks for assessing AI output quality in social work contexts

## Limitations & Open Questions

**Limitations:**
- Analysis is exploratory and cursory, focusing on three curriculum areas rather than comprehensive redesign
- Rapid technological evolution (GPT-4o updates) may quickly date findings and recommendations
- Few German universities currently provide structured student AI access, limiting empirical validation of proposed approaches
- Study cannot comprehensively address AI fundamentals or provide definitive implementation guidance
- Scope prevents systematic examination of digital equity and ethical data-handling concerns

**Open Questions:**
- How do AI-assisted learning experiences affect long-term critical thinking development compared to traditional methods?
- What assessment frameworks best capture learning value in human-AI collaborative work?
- How can institutions ensure equitable AI access without exacerbating existing educational inequalities?
- What discipline-specific competencies distinguish effective from ineffective AI utilization in social work practice?

## Relation to Other Research

- **AI in Higher Education:** This study contributes practical frameworks to emerging literature on meaningful AI integration beyond simplistic adoption or rejection approaches.
- **Pedagogical Transformation:** Connects to research on how emerging technologies reshape educator roles, assessment methods, and learning outcomes.
- **Professional Competency Development:** Relates to social work education literature examining how to develop critical thinking and authentic practice skills amid technological change.
- **Academic Integrity in Digital Contexts:** Addresses ongoing scholarly debates about assessment validity and student learning verification in technology-mediated environments.

## Significance

This work matters because it moves beyond polarized AI discourse toward nuanced pedagogical frameworks. As generative AI becomes ubiquitous, social work programs cannot ignore integration—yet must do so thoughtfully. The authors' reconceptualization of AI as collaborative non-human agent rather than neutral tool fundamentally reframes implementation challenges. By identifying prompting competence as core learning outcome and proposing process-oriented assessment, they provide actionable guidance for educators facing immediate curricular decisions. The emphasis on hybrid human-machine learning spaces acknowledges technological inevitability while preserving authentic professional development. For social work specifically, this matters because the profession's core competencies—critical analysis, ethical reasoning, authentic human relationship-building—must remain central even as tools evolve. The framework enables institutions to leverage AI's genuine pedagogical benefits (practice simulation, writing support, concept exploration) while maintaining rigorous standards and authentic professional preparation. Ultimately, this research positions social work education to lead thoughtful AI integration rather than reactively respond to technological disruption.
