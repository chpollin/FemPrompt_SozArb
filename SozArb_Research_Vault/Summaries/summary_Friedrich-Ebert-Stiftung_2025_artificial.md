# Summary: Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung 2025 artificial

## Overview

Anastasia Karagianni's analysis, published by the Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung's Competence Centre on the Future of Work in January 2025, provides a critical feminist examination of the European Union's Artificial Intelligence Act. Published by a leading German social democratic think tank specializing in labor and future of work issues, the document interrogates whether this landmark regulatory framework adequately protects against gender-based discrimination and bias embedded in AI systems. Rather than accepting the AI Act as gender-neutral legislation, the author employs feminist theory to expose structural gaps that perpetuate or amplify gender inequities, particularly affecting marginalized women, women of color, and women from disadvantaged communities. The analysis fundamentally challenges whether formal legal protections automatically translate into substantive gender equality and power redistribution.

## Main Findings

The research identifies systematic deficiencies across five critical articles. Article 5's vulnerability provisions fail to articulate gender-specific vulnerabilities, treating vulnerability as generic rather than acknowledging intersectional gender impacts. Article 6 on harmonization lacks explicit gender-responsive requirements, enabling inconsistent member state protections. Article 40(1) on standardization provides no mandatory gender bias testing standards. Article 43's conformity assessment mechanisms lack procedures for verifying gender impact compliance. Article 27's Fundamental Rights Impact Assessment (FRIA) does not mandate gender impact assessments, treating gender equality as optional.

The document illustrates these gaps through four concrete case studies: recruitment algorithms discriminating against women, healthcare AI producing gendered health outcomes, border management systems differentially impacting migrant women, and predictive policing tools misidentifying domestic violence patterns. These examples demonstrate gender-neutral regulation fails to address gendered harms. The analysis concludes the AI Act requires strengthening through mandatory gender impact assessments and explicit gender-responsive provisions across all regulatory mechanisms.

## Methodology/Approach

The analysis employs integrated feminist methodology combining theoretical and practical dimensions. Feminist theory provides foundational analysis moving beyond formal equality to examine substantive equity and power imbalances. Gender-responsive text analysis systematically examines legislative language for explicit gender protections and implicit gender blindness. Article-by-article examination from a feminist perspective identifies specific regulatory gaps. Case study approach grounds abstract legal analysis in real-world impacts across employment, healthcare, security, and justice domains. This methodology transcends technical compliance assessment to interrogate how regulatory frameworks reproduce or challenge structural gender inequities.

## Relevant Concepts

**Gender bias in AI**: Systematic discrimination embedded in algorithmic systems that produces gendered outcomes, distinct from individual prejudice.

**Structural gender inequities**: Systemic patterns in institutions and technologies disadvantaging women, particularly marginalized women, beyond individual discrimination.

**Intersectionality**: Framework recognizing how gender intersects with race, class, and other identities to create compound vulnerabilities requiring specific protections.

**Substantive equality**: Moving beyond formal legal equality to achieve actual equitable outcomes and power redistribution.

**Gender-responsive regulation**: Legal frameworks explicitly designed to address gender-specific impacts rather than assuming gender neutrality ensures equality.

**Fundamental Rights Impact Assessment (FRIA)**: Mandatory evaluation of AI systems' impacts on fundamental rights, currently insufficient without integrated gender analysis.

**Power imbalances in AI**: Structural advantages embedded in AI systems that reinforce existing hierarchies and disadvantage marginalized groups.

## Significance

This analysis contributes critically to AI governance discourse by demonstrating technical regulation alone cannot address gendered harms. It provides evidence-based recommendations for mandatory, explicit gender impact assessments integrated throughout AI regulation. The work bridges feminist technology studies with EU policy analysis, offering actionable guidance for policymakers and advocates. By documenting specific legislative gaps with concrete case studies, Karagianni creates a methodological model for gender-responsive AI governance applicable globally. The document's significance extends beyond compliance assessment to challenge fundamental assumptions that gender-neutral regulation protects gender equality, establishing gender impact assessment as essential infrastructure for equitable AI governance.
