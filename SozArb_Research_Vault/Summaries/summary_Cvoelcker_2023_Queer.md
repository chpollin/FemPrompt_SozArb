# Summary: Queer in AI: A Case Study in Community-Led Participatory AI

## Overview
AI technologies increasingly harm queer communities through privacy violations, content censoring, forced outing, and algorithmic misgendering. Existing AI governance structures fail to center marginalized voices in technology design and deployment decisions. This research examines Queer in AI, a global grassroots organization, as a case study in community-led participatory design for AI equity. The study documents how decentralized, intersectional approaches can identify harms, build inclusive communities, and influence external institutions—while also revealing gaps between theoretical commitments and operational implementation. The research bridges participatory design theory with real-world activism, demonstrating both the potential and challenges of equity-centered AI governance led by affected communities.

## Main Findings

1. **AI systems cause specific, documented harms to queer people** including privacy violations, content suppression, algorithmic outing, deadnaming, and identity misclassification that violate core tenets of queerness.

2. **Decentralized governance structures effectively reject hierarchy** and enable grassroots organizing, contrasting with top-down institutional approaches to AI governance.

3. **Community-led participatory design successfully builds programs by and for marginalized communities**, creating spaces where queer people shape AI discussions affecting their lives.

4. **Intersectional frameworks address overlapping identities and oppressions** more effectively than single-issue approaches to AI equity.

5. **Significant gaps exist between stated participatory and intersectional principles and actual operational implementation** within the organization.

6. **Grassroots organizations effectively critique exploitative participatory practices** and influence external institutions beyond their membership.

7. **Community-led approaches foster cultures of participation in AI** by welcoming marginalized participants and bringing participatory methods to institutional contexts.

## Methodology/Approach

This qualitative case study analyzes Queer in AI's organizational practices, governance structures, and programs through examination of organizational documentation and program assessment. The researchers investigated how participatory design and intersectional frameworks shaped the organization's initiatives over time. The study employed a reflexive approach, with organizers themselves conducting analysis of their own practices. Data collection likely included analysis of organizational communications, program documentation, and assessment of external institutional engagement. The methodology examined both successes and failures in operationalizing participatory and intersectional principles, providing nuanced insights into implementation challenges. The case study approach allows deep examination of how theory translates into practice within a specific organizational context while generating insights applicable to participatory design broadly.

## Relevant Concepts

**Participatory Design:** Methodologies that actively involve affected communities in designing solutions, policies, or technologies that impact them, rather than imposing top-down solutions.

**Intersectionality:** Framework recognizing that individuals hold multiple, overlapping identities (race, gender, sexuality, class) that interact to create distinct experiences of oppression and privilege.

**Community-Led Activism:** Grassroots organizing where affected communities lead decision-making, strategy, and implementation rather than external experts or institutions.

**Algorithmic Harm:** Negative impacts caused by AI systems, including discrimination, privacy violations, misrepresentation, and identity erasure affecting specific communities.

**Decentralized Governance:** Organizational structures distributing decision-making power across members rather than concentrating authority in hierarchical leadership.

**Operationalization:** The process of translating theoretical principles or commitments into concrete, measurable practices and policies.

**Marginalized Communities:** Groups systematically excluded from power, resources, and decision-making due to social hierarchies based on identity characteristics.

## Practical Implications

**For Social Workers:**
- Recognize grassroots organizations as essential partners in advocating for technology justice affecting vulnerable clients
- Support community-led participatory approaches rather than imposing external solutions to technology-related harms

**For Organizations:**
- Adopt decentralized governance structures that distribute decision-making power to affected community members
- Implement regular audits assessing gaps between stated intersectional principles and actual operational practices
- Build sustained funding and support for grassroots organizations addressing technology harms

**For Policymakers:**
- Center marginalized communities in AI governance and regulation development, not as consultants but as decision-makers
- Fund and support community-led participatory initiatives addressing algorithmic harms
- Require participatory design processes in AI development affecting vulnerable populations

**For Researchers:**
- Conduct participatory research with affected communities rather than studying them as subjects
- Document both successes and implementation failures in participatory design to advance methodological knowledge
- Examine how grassroots organizations influence institutional practices beyond their membership

## Limitations & Open Questions

**Limitations:**
- Abstract does not specify time period studied, limiting understanding of organizational evolution
- Specific operational gaps between theory and practice are mentioned but not detailed in available text
- Generalizability to other marginalized communities or organizational contexts remains unclear
- Quantification of institutional impact or influence on external AI development practices not addressed

**Open Questions:**
- How do decentralized governance structures scale while maintaining participatory principles?
- What specific mechanisms enable grassroots organizations to influence external institutions?
- How can organizations systematically operationalize intersectional principles in practice?
- What are long-term sustainability challenges for volunteer-run grassroots organizations?

## Relation to Other Research

- **Technology Justice & Equity:** Connects to research examining how marginalized communities experience algorithmic harms and advocating for equitable technology governance
- **Participatory Design Methods:** Contributes to literature on participatory approaches in technology development, documenting real-world implementation challenges
- **Grassroots Activism & Social Movements:** Relates to research on how communities organize for social change outside institutional structures
- **Intersectionality in Practice:** Advances understanding of how intersectional frameworks translate into organizational practice and policy

## Significance

This research demonstrates that community-led participatory design offers viable alternatives to institutional AI governance that systematically excludes marginalized voices. By documenting Queer in AI's work, the study validates grassroots activism as legitimate knowledge production and policy influence. The findings challenge assumptions that AI governance requires top-down expertise, showing instead that affected communities possess essential knowledge about harms and solutions. The honest assessment of implementation gaps provides crucial learning for other organizations attempting participatory approaches. Ultimately, this work argues that equitable AI futures require centering marginalized communities not as consultants but as leaders, while acknowledging the sustained effort required to operationalize participatory and intersectional principles beyond rhetoric.
