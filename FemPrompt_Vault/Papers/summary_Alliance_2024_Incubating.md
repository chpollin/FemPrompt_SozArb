# Summary: Alliance 2024 Incubating

## Overview

The Feminist AI Research Network (f<a+i>r) represents a strategic initiative spanning 2021-2024 designed to transform how artificial intelligence and automated decision-making systems advance gender and social justice. Operating across three regional hubs—Latin America, Middle East North Africa, and Southeast Asia—spanning 10 countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Mexico, the Philippines, Thailand), the network shifts from theoretical critique to applied research on "how" feminist AI can concretely impact marginalized communities. The initiative reconceptualizes the feminist AI vision from a "floor" focused on preventing Gender-Based Violence to a "ceiling" enabling equal partnership in decision-making and tool-making. Rather than treating AI as a neutral tool requiring ethical guardrails, f<a+i>r positions feminist AI as inherently transformative, capable of creating affirmative justice outcomes when designed with inclusion at its core. This approach moves beyond documenting algorithmic harms to constructing alternative systems embedding equality from inception.

## Main Findings

The initiative generated 18 research outputs across a structured progression: **9 foundational papers** establishing context-specific research agendas (labor discrimination in Thai service sectors, gender bias in MENA language processing, public procurement anomalies in Ecuador, work-related disease documentation in Chile, child marriage prevention in Indonesia, human trafficking interventions in Thailand, and natural resource governance); **4 papers advancing to prototype conception** (mainstreaming gender in crowdsourced AI work, feminist AI frameworks for practice, explainable AI systems for Egyptian schools, and community perspectives on AI governance); and **5 complete paper-prototype-pilot cycles** producing deployable tools. The five operational technologies include: SafeHer Transit (women's safety app prioritizing user preferences in the Philippines), E.D.I.A. (bias detection tool for natural language processing in Argentina), AymurAI (gender-based violence measurement system in Argentina), SOF+IA (AI chatbot addressing digital harassment and violence on social media in Chile), and AI & Equality Human Rights Toolbox with accompanying course and community engagement model. These outputs demonstrate that feminist AI principles translate into concrete technological interventions addressing documented community needs.

## Methodology/Approach

f<a+i>r employs a distinctive **paper → prototype → pilot methodology** integrating multiple epistemological frameworks across regional contexts. The approach combines design justice principles emphasizing community participation, human rights-based frameworks grounding technical work in equity outcomes, multidisciplinary teams bridging technologists and social scientists, and multi-stakeholder partnerships spanning public and private sectors. Critically, affected communities function as equal partners in meaningful co-creation rather than research subjects, ensuring technologies meet actual needs of women, girls, and marginalized populations in vulnerable communities. This applied research methodology prioritizes validation and real-world testing, rejecting theoretical abstraction in favor of iterative development informed by community feedback and contextual specificity. The framework explicitly rejects universal solutions, instead addressing region-specific challenges through localized research teams.

## Relevant Concepts

**Feminist AI**: Artificial intelligence harnessed to deliver equality outcomes, designed with inclusion at the core, creating opportunities for proactive correction of systemic inequities and historic exclusion.

**Design Justice Principles**: Framework centering the most marginalized communities as essential partners in technology design processes, challenging extractive research practices and ensuring technology meets community needs.

**Human Rights-Based Approaches**: Methodology grounding technical development in fundamental rights frameworks and social/gender justice outcomes rather than efficiency or profit metrics.

**Meaningful Community Engagement**: Distinction from tokenistic participation; communities function as equal decision-makers in co-creation, validation, and pilot testing phases.

**Regional Contextualization**: Recognition that gender-justice applications require addressing specific local challenges (trafficking, child marriage, labor exploitation, language bias) rather than implementing universal solutions.

**Floor-to-Ceiling Vision**: Conceptual shift from reactive prevention of Gender-Based Violence (floor) to proactive creation of opportunities and equal partnership (ceiling).

## Significance

This work fundamentally reframes AI governance discourse by shifting from reactive harm mitigation to affirmative justice construction. By centering Global South perspectives across 10 countries and rejecting Western-centric narratives, f<a+i>r challenges techno-solutionism while demonstrating that meaningful feminist AI requires sustained community engagement, multidisciplinary collaboration, and commitment to regional specificity. The initiative's emphasis on moving from critical analysis to alternative system-building—operationalized through five deployable tools—establishes a methodological model for technology development prioritizing equity outcomes over technological advancement alone. Global recognition through venues like the ACM Conference on Equity validates this approach's significance within international AI governance discourse.
