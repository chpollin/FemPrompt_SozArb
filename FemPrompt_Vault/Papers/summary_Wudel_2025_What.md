# Summary: Wudel 2025 What

## Overview

"What is Feminist AI?" is a policy-oriented academic document published by the Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung's Competence Centre on the Future of Work in January 2025. Authored by Alexandra Wudel and Anna Ehrenberg, the paper introduces Feminist Artificial Intelligence (FAI) as a comprehensive framework for addressing systemic biases and power inequalities in AI development. The document positions FAI as both theoretical intervention and practical policy tool, grounded in intersectional feminist methodology rather than technical fixes alone. Published by a social democratic think tank, the work targets EU governance contexts while advancing broader arguments about the necessity of feminist approaches to technological development and the inadequacy of conventional "ethical AI" frameworks.

## Main Findings

The analysis reveals five critical findings. First, FAI fundamentally departs from conventional AI paradigms by prioritizing structural inequality reduction over surface-level bias mitigation, explicitly critiquing male-dominated, Western-centric biases embedded in traditional development. Second, practical FAI implementation requires a three-part strategy: (1) embedding feminist methodology to reduce power inequalities throughout development cycles; (2) ensuring AI systems meet concrete societal demands with demonstrable implementation potential; (3) establishing continuous mechanisms for systems to evolve with changing social contexts. Third, accountability and equity must be architecturally embedded from inception rather than applied retrospectively. Fourth, existing frameworks like "ethical AI" and "responsible AI" are insufficient because they fail to interrogate underlying structural power dynamics. Fifth, FAI demands genuine interdisciplinary collaboration and iterative theory-practice cycles, illustrated through concrete interventions: FemAI's advocacy for feminist perspectives in EU AI Act regulation and the MIRA diagnostic platform aligning AI tools with social justice objectives.

## Methodology/Approach

The paper employs intersectional feminism as theoretical foundation combined with systemic power analysis. The methodology operationalizes three interconnected elements: (1) **Interdisciplinary collaboration** bridging technical AI development with social science and feminist scholarship; (2) **Iterative theory-practice cycles** continuously testing and refining feminist principles against real-world implementation contexts; (3) **Continuous societal assessment** ensuring AI systems remain responsive to evolving social needs rather than crystallizing existing inequalities. Rather than remaining purely theoretical, authors ground FAI through case studies demonstrating how feminist methodology translates into actionable policy interventions and technological design practices.

## Relevant Concepts

**Intersectional Feminism**: Analytical framework recognizing how multiple, overlapping systems of oppression (gender, race, class, nationality) compound to shape experiences and outcomes; applied to understand how AI systems perpetuate compound inequalities across intersecting dimensions.

**Systemic Power Analysis**: Examination of structural power dynamics embedded in institutions, technologies, and development processes, focusing on how systems reproduce hierarchies rather than individual bias.

**Structural Inequality Reduction**: Moving beyond diversity metrics to fundamentally alter power relationships embedded in AI architecture, governance, and deployment.

**Theory-Practice Integration**: Deliberate bridging of academic feminist theory and practical technological implementation through continuous feedback and collaborative development cycles.

**Social Sustainability**: Ensuring AI systems serve diverse populations equitably over time and adapt to changing societal contexts without perpetuating harm.

**Accountability Mechanisms**: Embedded processes ensuring responsibility throughout development, not external oversight added post-deployment.

## Significance

This work holds substantial significance for multiple constituencies. For EU policy makers, it provides a framework for integrating feminist principles into AI governance and regulation. For technologists and developers, it challenges conventional practices by demanding structural accountability from inception. For scholars, it advances critical AI studies by demonstrating how feminist theory productively interrogates technological systems. For social justice advocates, it positions feminism as essential methodology rather than supplementary consideration. Most broadly, the document argues that achieving socially sustainable, equitable AI requires fundamental reimagining of development processesâ€”moving beyond incremental reforms toward structural transformation of how AI systems are conceptualized, governed, and deployed across society.
