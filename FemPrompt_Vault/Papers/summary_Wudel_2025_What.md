# Summary: Wudel 2025 What

## Overview

"What is Feminist AI?" is a January 2025 policy document by Alexandra Wudel and Anna Ehrenberg, published by the Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung's Competence Centre on the Future of Work. The document introduces Feminist Artificial Intelligence (FAI) as a comprehensive framework that integrates intersectional feminist principles into AI system development and deployment. FAI fundamentally reconceptualizes AI inequities not as technical problems requiring algorithmic fixes, but as manifestations of structural power imbalances rooted in male-dominated, Western-centric development paradigms. The document argues that meaningful progress toward equitable AI requires paradigm shifts in how AI systems are conceived, designed, and continuously refined throughout their lifecycle through interdisciplinary collaboration and systemic power analysis.

## Main Findings

The analysis reveals four critical findings. First, **FAI operates as structural intervention** transcending technical bias-correction by embedding intersectional feminist methodology into AI development to target root causes of inequality rather than symptoms. Second, **three distinct mechanisms bridge theory-practice gaps**: (1) reducing power inequalities through feminist methodology, (2) ensuring societal relevance and implementation feasibility, and (3) enabling continuous development reflecting changing societal influences. Third, **FAI requires interdisciplinary collaboration and systemic power analysis** as foundational requirements, distinguishing it from traditional AI development approaches. Fourth, concrete applications—including FemAI's advocacy for feminist perspectives in EU AI Act development and the MIRA diagnostic platform—demonstrate that FAI possesses genuine implementation potential, promoting accountability and equity in AI solutions while challenging male-dominated technological paradigms.

## Methodology/Approach

The document employs a multi-layered analytical approach combining theoretical rigor with practical grounding. **Intersectional feminism** serves as the primary analytical lens, enabling examination of overlapping, interconnected systems of oppression within AI contexts. The authors utilize **iterative theory-practice loops**, conceptualizing development as cyclical refinement between conceptual frameworks and real-world applications ensuring continuous feedback and adaptation. A **case study approach** grounds abstract principles through concrete exemplars (FemAI's policy advocacy, MIRA's diagnostic applications). **Systemic power analysis** identifies how structural inequalities become embedded within AI systems. This integrated methodology bridges academic scholarship and policy-oriented practice, reflecting institutional positioning within a social democratic think tank committed to evidence-based governance.

## Relevant Concepts

- **Feminist Artificial Intelligence (FAI)**: Framework embedding feminist values (equity, freedom, justice) into AI development to challenge structural inequalities and power imbalances, distinguishing itself from traditional bias-correction approaches.

- **Intersectional Feminism**: Analytical approach examining overlapping systems of oppression (gender, race, class) simultaneously within technological contexts.

- **Systemic Power Analysis**: Methodology identifying how structural inequalities become embedded within AI architectures, development processes, and governance structures.

- **Power Inequalities**: Structural imbalances in decision-making authority and value representation within AI development, distinct from algorithmic bias.

- **Social Sustainability**: Long-term equitable and accountable AI development reflecting societal values and continuously adapting to changing social influences.

- **Implementation Potential**: Demonstrated capacity of FAI frameworks to translate theoretical principles into practical, deployable solutions within institutional contexts.

- **Theory-Practice Integration**: Cyclical process bridging conceptual frameworks with real-world implementation through continuous refinement and adaptation.

## Significance

This document holds substantial significance for multiple constituencies. For **policy makers**, it provides frameworks for integrating feminist principles into AI regulation with demonstrated institutional engagement (EU AI Act). For **technology developers**, it challenges conventional paradigms and proposes alternative methodologies requiring interdisciplinary collaboration and systemic power analysis. For **academic discourse**, it advances critical AI studies beyond descriptive critique toward prescriptive frameworks, positioning feminist technology studies as central to technological governance. The document's emphasis on **continuous development reflecting changing societal influences** establishes FAI as adaptive rather than static. By positioning FAI as essential rather than supplementary, the authors argue that social sustainability in AI depends fundamentally upon embedding feminist values throughout technological lifecycles, making this work significant for shaping emerging AI governance frameworks and establishing accountability standards for equitable AI development.
