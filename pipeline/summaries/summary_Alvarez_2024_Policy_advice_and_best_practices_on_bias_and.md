# Summary: Policy Advice and Best Practices on Bias and Fairness in AI

## Overview
Artificial intelligence deployment in socially sensitive applications has accelerated without corresponding systematic approaches to managing embedded biases. The literature on AI bias and fairness has expanded rapidly but remains fragmented, creating accessibility barriers for researchers and practitioners navigating the field. This paper addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive survey of fair-AI methods, policies, and standards while contributing original guidance through the NoBIAS research project. The central thesis is that managing AI bias requires coordinated intervention across legal, technical, and organizational domains—not merely technical optimization of fairness metrics. The work emphasizes that AI systems are inherently value-laden, encoding biases from data, algorithmic design, and organizational processes, necessitating multidisciplinary approaches grounded in legal and ethical frameworks.

## Main Findings

1. **Bias originates from three distinct sources:** pre-existing bias embedded in data (which is non-neutral and value-laden), technical bias from algorithmic design choices and heuristic optimization, and emerging bias from organizational processes deploying AI systems under untested conditions.

2. **Fair-AI research is nascent but rapidly expanding:** Starting only 15 years ago with foundational work by Pedreschi et al. (2008) and Kamiran and Calders (2009), the field has evolved from addressing discrimination in machine learning to encompassing all AI subfields and potential harms to individuals and communities.

3. **Current fair-AI approaches are overly technical:** The dominant paradigm reduces fairness to numeric optimization of metrics while neglecting problem-specific contexts, philosophical frameworks, legal theories of equality, and distributive justice considerations essential for meaningful bias mitigation.

4. **The NoBIAS two-layered architecture bridges legal and technical domains:** A Legal Layer addresses EU regulatory context while a Bias Management Layer systematizes understanding, mitigating, and accounting for bias across intervention levels.

5. **Multiple intervention pathways exist:** Solutions range from non-use of AI systems to comprehensive societal-level interventions, including bias documentation, technical mitigation, auditing, and organizational redesign.

## Methodology/Approach

The paper employs a multidisciplinary survey methodology synthesizing existing literature on fair-AI methods, standards, and best practices across domains including social data, machine learning, recommender systems, algorithmic hiring, and large language models. The authors leverage empirical findings from the NoBIAS research project, which investigated legal challenges within EU legislation and multidisciplinary approaches to bias understanding and mitigation. The analysis distinguishes between human cognitive biases and AI-specific bias sources, examines validity concerns (internal validity regarding oversimplification and external validity regarding generalizability), and inventories policy initiatives and industry standards. The approach prioritizes survey papers and recent works given the literature's volume, providing structured entry points for novel researchers while identifying underrepresented topics in current scholarship.

## Relevant Concepts

**Pre-existing Bias:** Bias embedded in training data that reflects historical inequalities and value-laden representations of reality, inherited by AI models during learning.

**Technical Bias:** Bias originating from algorithmic design choices, heuristic optimization strategies, and quantitative loss metrics that oversimplify complex reality.

**Emerging Bias:** Bias arising from organizational processes deploying AI systems under untested or unplanned conditions, reflecting implementation contexts rather than model design.

**Fair-AI:** The multidisciplinary field addressing detection, mitigation, and control of biases in AI-supported decision-making, particularly when biases produce ethically unfair or legally discriminatory outcomes.

**Internal Validity:** The degree to which AI models accurately represent the complexity of reality they abstract, threatened by oversimplification through quantitative optimization.

**External Validity:** The generalizability of AI models across different contexts and conditions, compromised when systems are deployed under untested circumstances.

**Value-Laden Systems:** AI systems that inherently create moral consequences, reinforce or undercut ethical principles, and enable or diminish stakeholder rights and dignity, contrary to claims of neutrality.

## Practical Implications

**For Organizations:**
- Implement the NoBIAS two-layered framework integrating legal compliance (EU regulations) with technical bias mitigation strategies
- Establish multidisciplinary bias management processes beyond technical optimization, incorporating legal, ethical, and organizational perspectives
- Document bias sources systematically and conduct regular audits of AI systems deployed in sensitive applications

**For Policymakers:**
- Develop regulatory frameworks recognizing that bias management requires intervention across legal, technical, and organizational domains
- Establish standards requiring organizations to demonstrate understanding of bias sources and mitigation approaches, not merely fairness metric optimization

**For Researchers:**
- Expand fair-AI research beyond technical metrics toward substantive engagement with philosophical, political, legal, and economic theories of equality
- Investigate underrepresented topics in bias and fairness literature, particularly organizational and policy-level interventions

**For Practitioners:**
- Use this survey as an accessible entry point to multidisciplinary bias research and existing best practices
- Recognize that managing bias requires coordinated approaches spanning data curation, algorithmic design, and organizational deployment decisions

## Limitations & Open Questions

**Limitations:**
- EU-centric focus limits applicability to non-European regulatory contexts
- Authors disclaim completeness of proposed advice and best practices, positioning contributions as incremental
- Limited concrete findings and detailed methodological specifics in presented sections
- Insufficient literature development on certain bias/fairness topics and AI generalizability under untested conditions

**Open Questions:**
- How can organizations balance technical fairness optimization with substantive engagement with justice and equality theories?
- What intervention pathways prove most effective across different AI application domains and organizational contexts?
- How should regulatory frameworks address bias management across legal, technical, and organizational domains simultaneously?

## Relation to Other Research

- **Algorithmic Accountability:** This work connects to broader research on making AI systems transparent and answerable for discriminatory outcomes through systematic bias documentation and auditing.
- **Regulatory Compliance and AI Governance:** The paper addresses how legal frameworks (particularly EU legislation) must integrate with technical practices to operationalize fairness requirements.
- **Multidisciplinary AI Ethics:** The work bridges technical computer science with philosophy, law, and social science perspectives on fairness and justice.
- **Organizational Change Management:** The emphasis on emerging bias and organizational processes relates to research on implementing ethical AI practices within institutional structures.

## Significance

This paper provides critical infrastructure for an increasingly fragmented field by offering accessible entry points to multidisciplinary bias research and establishing systematic frameworks for practitioners. Its significance extends beyond literature review: by demonstrating that technical fairness metrics alone are insufficient and that bias management requires coordinated legal, technical, and organizational intervention, the work advances awareness essential for responsible AI deployment. The NoBIAS framework offers policymakers and organizations concrete pathways for integrating regulatory compliance with technical mitigation. As AI systems increasingly influence consequential decisions affecting protected social groups, this work's emphasis on value-laden systems and multidisciplinary approaches provides necessary counterweight to technocratic bias management, potentially reducing discriminatory harms while advancing more substantive justice considerations in AI governance.
