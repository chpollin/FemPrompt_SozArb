# Summary: Attard-Frost_2025_Countergovernance

SCORES:
Accuracy: 65
Completeness: 72
Structure: 85
Actionability: 78

IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED:
1. The summary claims "All 30+ roundtable participants unanimously identified insufficient public engagement" - the original document states experts "expressed great concern" but does not explicitly claim unanimity on this point. This is an unsupported inference.

2. The summary references "an open letter signed by 45 Canadian civil society organizations demanding AIDA's separation from Bill C-27" in the Methodology section - this documentary evidence is NOT mentioned anywhere in the original document provided. This is a fabrication not supported by source material.

3. The summary extensively elaborates on "Marginalized Community Exclusion" as a major finding with specific details about "racialized groups, persons with disabilities, and low-income populations" - the original document only briefly mentions "marginalized communities" once in the executive summary without the detailed categorization or emphasis the summary provides.

4. The Methodology section claims the authors "reviewed documentary evidence including an open letter" and references "45 Canadian civil society organizations" - this goes beyond what the original document states about their research methods.

5. The summary adds substantial content under "Practical Implications" that is not derived from the original document, including specific examples like "algorithmic bias in benefits determination, predictive policing" which do not appear in the source material.

## IMPROVED SUMMARY: Canada's AI and Data Act Stakeholder Evaluation

### Overview
Canada's proposed Artificial Intelligence and Data Act (AIDA) represents a critical governance moment for technology regulation, yet its development process has lacked meaningful public consultation. This submission to Parliament, prepared by the Dais at Toronto Metropolitan University and the Centre for Media, Technology and Democracy at McGill University, documents concerns raised during a multistakeholder roundtable. The main thesis: AIDA requires substantial amendments and extended consultation before passage to ensure regulatory effectiveness and democratic legitimacy.

### Main Findings

1. **Consultation Deficit**: Roundtable participants expressed great concern with insufficient public engagement during AIDA's drafting stages, identified as a pervasive issue undermining the legislation's development.

2. **Definitional Ambiguity**: "High-impact systems"—central to AIDA's regulatory scope—remains undefined, creating uncertainty about which AI applications fall under regulation.

3. **Narrow Regulatory Scope**: AIDA focuses exclusively on "high-impact" systems, leaving broader harms from all AI systems unaddressed and excluding public sector AI use entirely.

4. **Limited Harm Definition**: The act defines harms only at the individual level, excluding population-group and community-level impacts.

5. **Regulatory Independence Concerns**: The requirement that the ISED Minister appoint the AI and Data Commissioner creates accountability gaps and compromises regulatory independence.

6. **Marginalized Community Exclusion**: Stakeholders noted that marginalized communities were notably absent from current consultation processes.

7. **Stakeholder Consensus on Solutions**: Participants across sectors proposed specific amendments addressing definitional clarity and expanded scope.

### Methodology/Approach

The authors employed a qualitative stakeholder deliberation model, convening a multistakeholder roundtable in October 2023 with over 30 participants from academia, civil society organizations, and industry. This deliberative research design captured diverse expert perspectives on AIDA's adequacy. Participants included representatives from organizations like the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, OpenMedia, Council of Canadian Innovators, and university researchers specializing in technology governance. The analysis synthesized stakeholder feedback to identify concerns and specific regulatory recommendations.

### Relevant Concepts

**High-Impact AI Systems:** AI applications with significant potential consequences, currently undefined in AIDA but proposed to include systems affecting fundamental rights, safety, or democratic processes.

**Regulatory Scope:** The boundaries defining which entities, systems, and harms fall under legislative oversight; AIDA's narrow scope excludes public institutions and community-level harms.

**Stakeholder Consultation:** Inclusive, transparent engagement with affected parties during policy development; notably absent from AIDA's drafting process.

**Regulatory Independence:** The structural separation between regulatory agencies and political appointees, essential for impartial enforcement and accountability.

**Marginalized Communities:** Populations historically underrepresented in policy processes and disproportionately affected by AI systems.

**Democratic Legitimacy:** Public trust in governance processes based on inclusive participation, transparency, and responsiveness to citizen concerns.

### Practical Implications

**For Policymakers:**
- Conduct rigorous public engagement before AIDA passage, with dedicated resources for marginalized community participation
- Establish explicit factors defining high-impact systems through regulation
- Separate AIDA from Bill C-27 to allow adequate deliberation time and stakeholder input
- Develop mechanisms for ongoing stakeholder consultation during implementation

**For Organizations:**
- Engage proactively in AIDA amendment consultations to clarify regulatory requirements
- Develop internal AI governance frameworks addressing transparency and accountability

**For Researchers:**
- Conduct studies tracking AI harms at population and community levels to inform future regulatory amendments
- Document consultation processes and stakeholder engagement patterns in technology governance

### Limitations & Open Questions

**Limitations:**
- Single October 2023 roundtable with 30+ participants represents limited sample potentially skewed toward organized stakeholders
- Research doesn't quantify broader Canadian public opinion on AI regulation preferences
- Analysis focuses on process critique rather than substantive policy evaluation of specific AIDA provisions

**Open Questions:**
- How can policymakers meaningfully engage marginalized communities historically excluded from technology governance?
- What specific AI applications should constitute "high-impact systems" across different sectors?
- How should regulatory frameworks address AI harms at community and population levels?

### Significance

This submission documents a critical moment in Canadian technology governance. Stakeholder concerns about consultation deficits signal legitimacy problems that, if unaddressed, will undermine AIDA's effectiveness. The research demonstrates that rushed legislative timelines compromise democratic processes and policy quality. By documenting stakeholder concerns and proposing specific amendments, this work provides Parliament with actionable guidance for improving AIDA before passage. The findings establish that inclusive consultation is essential for creating effective regulation that serves all Canadians, particularly communities most vulnerable to AI harms.
