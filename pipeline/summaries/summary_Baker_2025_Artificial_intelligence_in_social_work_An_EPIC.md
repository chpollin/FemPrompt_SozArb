# Summary: Baker_2025_Artificial_intelligence_in_social_work_An_EPIC

SCORES:
Accuracy: 85
Completeness: 78
Structure: 90
Actionability: 82

IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED:
1. The summary claims the paper discusses "First Nations peoples" as a specific focus, but the original document only lists this as a keyword without substantive discussion in the provided excerpt—this overstates the emphasis.
2. The summary includes extensive sections on "Limitations & Open Questions" and "Relation to Other Research" that are not present in the original document excerpt (only 8000 chars provided)—these appear to be inferred rather than extracted.
3. The summary should clarify that only the abstract and introduction section are provided in the original document, not the full paper, limiting ability to verify all claims about findings and implications.

IMPROVED SUMMARY:

# Summary: AI in Social Work - EPIC Model for Practice

## Overview
As artificial intelligence increasingly permeates social work environments, the profession faces critical decisions balancing technological opportunities against ethical risks. This paper addresses the need for a structured, proactive approach to AI integration aligned with social work's core mission of social justice. The author proposes the EPIC model—a four-component framework emphasizing ethics and justice, policy development, intersectoral collaboration, and community engagement—as essential guidance for responsible AI implementation.

## Key Arguments

1. **AI presents paradoxical opportunities and risks**: AI can enhance accessibility for people with disabilities, improve humanitarian aid efficiency, and advance healthcare diagnostics, yet simultaneously generates misinformation, perpetuates structural bias, and threatens human rights protections for vulnerable populations.

2. **Deep learning systems lack transparency and accountability**: Generative AI and deep neural networks operate as "black boxes"—their decision-making processes are opaque even to developers—creating accountability gaps particularly problematic when applied to high-stakes social work decisions affecting vulnerable people.

3. **Current policy frameworks lag behind technological advancement**: Professional standards and regulatory frameworks have not adequately addressed AI integration, leaving practitioners without clear ethical guidance.

4. **Structural bias in AI systems reflects training data limitations**: AI algorithms trained on non-representative historical datasets perpetuate existing discrimination patterns, particularly affecting marginalized communities.

5. **The EPIC model provides actionable integration framework**: The four-component approach (Ethics and Justice; Policy Development and Advocacy; Intersectoral Collaboration; Community Engagement and Empowerment) offers structured guidance for balancing AI benefits with ethical safeguards.

## Methodology
The author conducted a comprehensive literature review examining existing research at the intersection of AI and social work practice, synthesizing evidence on AI applications, risks, and benefits across healthcare, mental health, and child protection contexts. Drawing on these insights, the author developed the EPIC model as a prescriptive framework to guide ethical AI integration.

## Key Concepts Defined

**Artificial Intelligence (AI):** Computer technologies that mimic or simulate human intelligence, using mathematical logic to learn, reason, and self-correct.

**Generative AI:** A subcategory of AI with capacity to autonomously augment, synthesize, and innovate new data inspired from original datasets.

**Black Box Problem:** The opacity of deep learning systems' decision-making processes, where operations remain untraceable even to developers.

**EPIC Model:** A four-component framework comprising Ethics and Justice; Policy Development and Advocacy; Intersectoral Collaboration; and Community Engagement and Empowerment.

**Dual Human-Technology Approach:** Integration of AI capabilities with human professional judgment, maintaining social workers as primary decision-makers.

## Practical Implications

**For Social Workers:**
- Develop AI literacy to understand capabilities, limitations, and bias risks
- Maintain human oversight as primary decision-making authority, using AI as supplementary tool
- Advocate for inclusion of AI ethics guidelines in professional standards

**For Organizations:**
- Implement transparency protocols requiring explanation of AI-generated recommendations
- Create interdisciplinary teams bridging social work and technical expertise
- Establish accountability mechanisms for discriminatory AI outcomes

**For Policymakers:**
- Integrate AI guidelines into professional standards and regulatory frameworks
- Mandate bias audits and equity impact assessments for AI systems
- Establish accountability mechanisms for organizations using AI in social work

## Significance

This paper addresses a critical professional challenge as AI adoption accelerates across social work settings without adequate ethical frameworks. The EPIC model provides essential guidance for responsible implementation while positioning social work as essential to ensuring AI development serves human dignity and social justice rather than perpetuating systemic inequities.
