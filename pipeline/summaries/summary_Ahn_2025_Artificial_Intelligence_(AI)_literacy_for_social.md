# Summary: Ahn_2025_Artificial_Intelligence_(AI)_literacy_for_social

SCORES:
Accuracy: 92
Completeness: 88
Structure: 95
Actionability: 90

IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED:
1. The summary states "only three recent studies examine AI in social work practice" but the original document does not explicitly claim this is the total universe of research—it references multiple studies (Jung et al., 2024; Lee et al., 2024; Tambe & Rice, 2018) without stating these are the only three. This overstates the limitation.

2. The summary claims the paper "lacks primary data collection" but the original document is explicitly identified as "an invited paper" using literature review/synthesis—this should be framed as the paper's intended methodology rather than a limitation, since conceptual framework papers appropriately use this approach.

3. Missing explicit mention that the paper draws on Long and Magerko's (2020) AI literacy framework as its theoretical foundation—this is mentioned but could be more prominent as a methodological anchor.

IMPROVED SUMMARY:

# AI Literacy for Social Work: Detailed Summary

## Overview
Artificial intelligence is fundamentally reshaping society and social services, yet social workers lack systematic frameworks for understanding AI's capabilities, limitations, and ethical implications. This invited conceptual paper addresses a critical gap: while AI applications in social work show promise for identifying unmet needs and optimizing resource allocation, AI systems simultaneously risk deepening inequalities among vulnerable populations. The authors argue that AI literacy—the knowledge and skills to understand, use, and critically evaluate AI systems—is essential for contemporary social work practice, particularly when advocating for marginalized communities navigating AI-driven systems. Rather than proposing AI as a standalone competency, they advocate integrating AI literacy across all core social work competencies to ensure the profession can address emerging challenges while upholding professional values of equity and social justice.

## Main Findings

1. **AI literacy is foundational, not optional**: Social workers must understand AI's capabilities, biases, and limitations even when not directly using AI tools, because AI systems increasingly influence client services and policy decisions affecting vulnerable populations.

2. **AI applications span social work domains**: Predictive analytics identify at-risk families; generative AI drafts reports and summaries; computer vision detects falls in elderly clients; reinforcement learning optimizes substance use treatment decisions; simulation models optimize resource allocation.

3. **Research on AI in social work is emerging**: While recent scholarship explores AI applications in social work (Jung et al., 2024; Lee et al., 2024; Tambe & Rice, 2018) and AI education importance (Patton et al., 2023; Rodriguez et al., 2024; Singer et al., 2023), systematic strategies for developing AI literacy among social workers remain underexplored.

4. **Integration approach is superior to isolation**: AI literacy should permeate existing core competencies rather than constitute a separate competency, ensuring AI understanding becomes embedded across all practice domains.

5. **Systemic inequalities are amplified by AI**: AI systems risk exacerbating existing socioeconomic inequalities through biased training data, opaque decision-making, and unequal access—concerns particularly acute for social work's marginalized client populations.

6. **Values alignment is critical**: Social work's ethical principles of advocacy, social justice, and client-centered practice must guide AI implementation to prevent technology from undermining professional values.

## Methodology/Approach

This conceptual framework paper employs literature review and synthesis grounded in Long and Magerko's (2020) AI literacy framework. The authors integrate this theoretical foundation with social work's established core competencies, examining recent AI applications in social work and broader literature on AI's societal impacts. The analysis identifies how each core competency should evolve in response to AI-driven changes. Rather than proposing new competencies, the authors demonstrate how existing competencies must be reconceptualized to incorporate AI literacy. This approach grounds abstract AI concepts in social work's professional context and values.

## Relevant Concepts

**Artificial Intelligence (AI):** Computer systems designed to perform tasks requiring human intelligence, including learning from data, solving problems, and making decisions under uncertain conditions; encompasses machine learning, deep learning, generative AI, and computer vision.

**AI Literacy:** The knowledge and skills to understand, use, and critically evaluate AI systems, including awareness of AI's capabilities, limitations, biases, and societal impacts.

**Machine Learning:** Algorithms that analyze patterns in historical data to estimate likelihood of future events; includes supervised learning (using labeled outcomes) and unsupervised learning (identifying patterns without labels).

**Generative AI:** Neural networks powered by large language models (e.g., ChatGPT) that create new content including text, code, and summaries while maintaining contextual accuracy.

**Predictive Analytics:** AI applications using machine learning to identify individuals and families likely to benefit from intervention, such as students at risk of dropping out or families needing child welfare services.

**Algorithmic Bias:** Systematic errors in AI systems resulting from biased training data or flawed design, potentially discriminating against marginalized populations and amplifying existing social inequalities.

**Computer Vision:** AI technology that interprets visual information, with applications including fall detection for elderly clients and pattern recognition in medical imaging.

## Practical Implications

**For Social Workers:**
- Develop foundational understanding of how AI systems work, their limitations, and potential biases affecting client services
- Learn to critically evaluate AI-generated recommendations before implementing them in practice
- Advocate for transparency and ethical oversight when organizations implement AI systems affecting clients

**For Organizations:**
- Integrate AI literacy into all social work curricula and continuing education programs rather than offering isolated training
- Establish ethics review processes for AI implementation that include social work practitioners and affected community members
- Conduct impact assessments examining how AI systems affect marginalized populations before deployment

**For Policymakers:**
- Engage social workers in developing AI governance frameworks and ethical guidelines for social services
- Fund research examining AI's differential impacts on vulnerable populations
- Establish accountability mechanisms ensuring AI systems in social services align with equity and social justice principles

**For Researchers:**
- Conduct empirical studies examining AI literacy competency assessment and development among social workers
- Investigate how AI systems affect service outcomes for marginalized populations across diverse settings
- Develop social-work-specific AI literacy frameworks with measurable learning outcomes

## Limitations & Open Questions

**Limitations:**
- Emerging research base: while recent studies examine AI in social work, systematic strategies for assessing and promoting AI literacy among practitioners remain underexplored
- Implementation barriers unexplored: the paper doesn't address resource requirements, curriculum redesign challenges, or organizational barriers to integration
- Generalizability unclear: applicability across diverse social work settings, populations, and geographic contexts remains unexamined

**Open Questions:**
- How should AI literacy competency be assessed and measured within social work practice?
- What implementation strategies effectively integrate AI literacy across existing curricula without overwhelming practitioners?
- How do AI systems differentially impact outcomes for specific marginalized populations (e.g., racial minorities, low-income families, immigrant communities)?
- What organizational and policy changes are necessary to ensure social work values guide AI implementation?

## Relation to Other Research

- **Technology in social services:** This work extends literature on technology adoption in social work by emphasizing critical evaluation and equity considerations rather than uncritical implementation.

- **Professional competency development:** Connects to ongoing discussions about evolving social work competencies in response to societal changes, proposing integration rather than addition.

- **Algorithmic justice and bias:** Aligns with broader scholarship examining how AI systems amplify existing inequalities and the importance of diverse perspectives in technology governance.

- **Professional ethics in practice:** Extends social work ethics literature by addressing how professional values must guide emerging technology implementation.

## Significance

This paper addresses an urgent, underexamined intersection: as AI increasingly shapes social services, social workers lack systematic frameworks for understanding and critically evaluating these systems. The significance lies in reframing AI literacy from a specialized technical skill to a foundational professional competency essential for contemporary practice. By proposing integration across existing competencies rather than isolation, the authors provide a practical pathway for the profession to adapt without wholesale curriculum redesign. Most critically, this work centers social work's core commitment to marginalized populations, arguing that AI literacy is fundamentally about advocacy and equity. As algorithmic systems increasingly determine who receives services, how resources are allocated, and which families are flagged for intervention, social workers must understand these systems to protect clients from algorithmic discrimination. The paper's emphasis on values alignment—ensuring social work principles guide technology implementation—provides ethical grounding often absent from technical AI discussions. This work signals that AI literacy is not optional specialization but essential professional knowledge for all social workers.
