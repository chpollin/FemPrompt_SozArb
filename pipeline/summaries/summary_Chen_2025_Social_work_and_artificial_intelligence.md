# Summary: Chen 2025 Social

## Overview

This peer-reviewed academic study, published in the Journals of Business & Management Studies (Vol. 1, Issue 2, July 2025), examines the integration of artificial intelligence technology within social work practice through qualitative research involving social work professionals, AI developers, and policymakers. The research addresses a critical gap in contemporary professional literature by moving beyond purely technical discussions to investigate how AI can be responsibly incorporated while preserving social work's core ethical values, professional judgment, and humanistic care principles. Conducted by researchers from Chang Jung Christian University in Taiwan, this study provides empirical evidence for developing balanced integration strategies that prioritize both technological efficiency and professional integrity in human-centered service delivery.

## Main Findings

The study reveals that AI technology demonstrates significant potential for enhancing service efficiency, case management, and practice effectiveness in social work contexts. However, this efficiency gain accompanies substantial challenges across multiple dimensions. Critical findings include: (1) insufficient decision-making transparency in AI systems, preventing practitioners from understanding algorithmic reasoning; (2) inadequate ethical and regulatory frameworks governing AI use in social work, creating governance vacuums; (3) widespread technical literacy gaps among practitioners that impede responsible implementation; (4) social workers' insufficient trust and acceptance of AI systems as fundamental adoption barriers; and (5) risks to client confidentiality and sensitive information protection. The research identifies that previous scholarship concentrated narrowly on technical applications—such as risk assessment algorithms and automated case classification—while neglecting the profession's distinctive ethical dimensions, contextual complexity, and nuanced client understanding requirements. The study proposes that effective integration requires: developing explainable AI (XAI) systems clarifying algorithmic decision-making; establishing strengthened ethical governance structures; implementing comprehensive professional training programs addressing technical literacy; fostering genuine interdisciplinary collaboration; and prioritizing humanistic values alongside technological innovation.

## Methodology/Approach

The research employs qualitative methodologies designed to capture nuanced stakeholder perspectives through multiple data collection approaches. Primary methods include semi-structured interviews with social work professionals and focus group discussions involving AI technology developers and policymakers. This multi-stakeholder approach enables comprehensive understanding of integration challenges from diverse professional viewpoints, capturing practitioner concerns, technical feasibility perspectives, and policy considerations simultaneously. The theoretical framework integrates social work ethics, AI governance principles, and organizational change perspectives, reflecting an "integrated theoretical and practical perspective" rather than technology-centric analysis. This interdisciplinary approach acknowledges that responsible AI integration requires simultaneous attention to technical feasibility, ethical compliance, professional values, organizational readiness, and humanistic care preservation.

## Relevant Concepts

**Explainable AI (XAI):** AI systems designed to make their decision-making processes transparent and understandable to human users, addressing the "black box" problem in algorithmic decision-making and enabling professional accountability.

**Ethical Governance:** Institutional frameworks, policies, and oversight mechanisms ensuring AI applications comply with professional ethical standards, regulatory requirements, and social work values.

**Technical Literacy:** Practitioners' knowledge, competence, and confidence in understanding, appropriately utilizing, and critically evaluating AI technologies within professional contexts.

**Decision-making Transparency:** The clarity with which AI systems communicate their reasoning, recommendations, limitations, and confidence levels to social work professionals and clients.

**Humanistic Care:** Social work's core commitment to client dignity, contextual understanding, individual agency, and ethical judgment that transcends algorithmic decision-making.

**Client Confidentiality:** Protection of sensitive personal information and privacy rights in AI-mediated social work practice, ensuring data security and ethical information handling.

## Significance

This research holds substantial significance for multiple audiences and professional contexts. For social work practitioners, it provides evidence-based guidance for responsible AI adoption and identifies critical implementation barriers. For policymakers, it offers concrete recommendations for developing regulatory frameworks and governance structures. For AI developers, it clarifies social work-specific requirements for ethical system design and transparency standards. For academic discourse, it contributes to contemporary scholarship on responsible AI governance by demonstrating that technological advancement and humanistic practice are not mutually exclusive but require deliberate integration strategies. Broader significance lies in modeling how human-centered professions can thoughtfully integrate transformative technologies while maintaining core professional values. The study advances understanding of interdisciplinary collaboration requirements and establishes frameworks applicable beyond social work to other ethics-intensive professions requiring nuanced human judgment and client confidentiality protection.
