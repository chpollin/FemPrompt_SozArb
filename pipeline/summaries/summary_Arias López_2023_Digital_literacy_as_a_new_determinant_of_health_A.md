IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED:
1. The summary claims "Digital determinants should be elevated to 'super determinants'" - this specific language does not appear in the original document and represents an unsupported inference beyond what the authors state.
2. The summary states "Exclusion of review articles eliminates valuable synthesis and contradictory evidence" - this is a critical interpretation not explicitly supported by the document, which simply notes reviews were excluded without justifying why or discussing trade-offs.
3. The "Relation to Other Research" section is entirely generated synthesis not grounded in the original document, which contains no comparative discussion of related research areas.

# IMPROVED SUMMARY

## Digital Health Literacy as a Health Determinant: Summary

### Overview
As healthcare systems increasingly rely on digital technologies, a critical paradox emerges: digital innovations promise to serve underserved populations (elderly, rural, minorities, disabled) yet these groups face the greatest barriers to digital access and literacy. This scoping review addresses a significant research gap by systematically examining digital health literacy (DHL)—the ability to find and use health information via technology—as a foundational health determinant. The authors argue that DHL should be recognized alongside socioeconomic status, education, and race as a key determinant controlling access to healthcare and health outcomes. The review synthesizes evidence on DHL definitions, measurement tools, health impacts, and interventions, revealing that while measurement frameworks exist, effective interventions remain underdeveloped and the "digital divide" continues to exacerbate existing healthcare inequities.

## Main Findings

1. **DHL is a standardized, measurable construct** – Digital health literacy is consistently defined as the ability to find and use health information using technology to address health problems, enabling consistent measurement across studies.

2. **eHealth Literacy Scale (eHEALS) dominates assessment** – The eHEALS is the most widely used tool, measuring six core dimensions through self-report and available in multiple languages, providing standardized comparison across populations.

3. **Higher DHL correlates with improved health outcomes** – Individuals with higher eHEALS scores demonstrate better self-management, greater participation in medical decisions, improved mental health, and enhanced quality of life.

4. **Education and social support show promise** – Effective interventions addressing low DHL include structured education/training programs and social support mechanisms, though evidence remains limited.

5. **Digital divide exacerbates health inequities** – The paradox of digital health is that vulnerable populations most needing digital healthcare access face the greatest barriers, widening existing healthcare disparities.

6. **Digital technologies warrant recognition as health determinants** – Digital access and literacy should be recognized as key determinants of health, similar to socioeconomic status, income, education, age, race, ethnicity, and gender.

## Methodology/Approach
This scoping review followed the Arksey and O'Malley methodological framework. A qualified medical librarian designed a comprehensive search strategy querying Medline (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), Scopus, and Google Scholar using natural language and controlled vocabulary terms. Supplementary methods included hand-searching and citation chaining. From 268 articles identified (263 from initial search plus 5 from reference chaining), 53 underwent full-text analysis. The review focused on recent, highly-cited English-language publications while excluding review articles.

## Relevant Concepts

**Digital Health Literacy:** The ability to find and use health information using technology to address or solve a health problem.

**Digital Divide:** Disparities in access to and use of digital equipment, services, and internet connectivity, including both physical connection and ease of use, particularly affecting vulnerable populations.

**eHealth Literacy Scale (eHEALS):** A self-reported measurement instrument assessing six core dimensions of digital health literacy, available in multiple languages and widely used for standardized comparison.

**Health Determinants:** Factors controlling health outcomes, including socioeconomic status, income, education, age, race, ethnicity, and digital access and literacy.

**Self-Management:** Individuals' ability to monitor and manage their own health conditions and participate actively in healthcare decisions.

**Social Support:** Assistance enabling individuals to access and utilize digital health resources effectively.

## Practical Implications

**For Healthcare Providers:**
- Assess digital literacy as part of patient intake and identify patients needing digital health support
- Provide alternative non-digital access pathways to ensure equitable care regardless of digital literacy level

**For Organizations:**
- Implement digital health literacy training for staff to identify and support low-literacy patients
- Design user-friendly digital health interfaces with plain language and multilingual support

**For Policymakers:**
- Recognize digital health literacy as a key health determinant requiring policy intervention
- Support development and implementation of education/training and social support interventions to reduce the digital health divide

**For Researchers:**
- Develop and validate measurement tools for digital health literacy assessment
- Conduct rigorous studies on effective interventions to improve digital health literacy and reduce health disparities

## Limitations & Open Questions

**Limitations:**
- English-language restriction excludes non-English publications, limiting global perspective
- Recency and citation bias may favor recent, highly-cited articles
- Exclusion of review articles limits synthesis of existing evidence
- Limited documentation of specific intervention effectiveness and health outcomes

**Open Questions:**
- Which specific education and social support interventions produce measurable health improvements?
- How do DHL interventions perform across different cultural, linguistic, and socioeconomic contexts?
- What is the causal relationship between DHL and health outcomes?

## Significance
This review establishes digital health literacy as a critical but underdeveloped health equity issue. As healthcare systems accelerate digital transformation, failure to address DHL disparities will systematically exclude vulnerable populations from healthcare benefits while increasing their relative disadvantage. The identification of eHEALS as a standardized measurement tool enables consistent monitoring of progress. However, the gap between measurement capability and intervention effectiveness represents an urgent research and implementation priority. Recognizing digital technologies as key health determinants is essential for preventing technology from widening healthcare disparities. This work provides evidence-based justification for healthcare leaders and policymakers to invest in digital literacy interventions and ensure equitable access to digital health tools.
