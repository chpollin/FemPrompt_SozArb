## A framework for the Learning and Teaching of Critical AI Literacy skills

## Background/OU context

<!-- image -->

AI is distinct from other digital technologies due to its potential to profoundly reshape societies, economies and education systems. Unlike conventional information and communication technologies (ICTs), AI poses unique ethical and social challenges, such as issues of fairness, transparency, privacy and accountability. Additionally, AI's unique ability to mimic human behavior directly impacts human agency. These challenges require dedicated competencies beyond the scope of traditional digital literacy. (UNESCO)

<!-- image -->

Such dedicated competencies are not only required regarding the challenges artificial intelligence (AI) poses but also in relation to the unique opportunities it provides. The OU's Teaching and Learning Plan (20222027) Principle 1 -A highquality, supported distance learning experience is enabled through innovative teaching and assessment -states that we will ensure that the use of new learning systems and technological innovation such as AI enhance our efficient delivery of high-quality teaching and assessment. Staff need to develop their AI literacy so that they can safely and effectively employ AI, and GenAI in particular, to support students' learning and achievement of their individual goals.

<!-- image -->

AI literacy differs from how we currently teach digital literacy. It involves 'a set of competencies that enables individuals to critically evaluate AI technologies; communicate and collaborate effectively with AI; and use AI as a tool online, at home, sch ool, and in the workplace' (Long &amp; Magerko, 2020, p2). These skills help staff and students gain essential transferable abilities in the field of AI.

As educators, we need to keep up with the evolving nature of AI and encourage students to use iterative interactions rather than a simple input -output approach where users instruct it (input) and copy, paste and edit what it generates (output). Engaging with AI-enabled applications that act as assistants will become a way of complementing learning rather than replacing it (Darvishi et al., 2024).

With rapid advancements in the AI space, staff and students must adapt current ways of working with technology and adopt new approaches to keep up with the pace of change, emphasising the importance of 'learning agility.' Metacognitive skills, particularly awareness of one's role in the learning process, will become increasingly important. Individuals must dedicate time to reflection, engagement with feedback, and the acquisition of new knowledge. Many jobs will require a different skillset, making it vital for students to learn and practise AI competencies. Developing Critical AI Literacy is essential, especially in contexts with many learners from widening participation backgrounds.

## What is Critical AI Literacy?

Critical AI Literacy serves as the foundation for this framework, which expands the critical thinking and critical evaluation dimensions of AI literacy described in definitions such as Long and Magerko's (2020) above. Critical AI Literacy shares common ground with Critical Digital Literacy, which highlights the influence of power in digital spaces . It explores how knowledge, identities and relationships are shaped to privilege some while marginalising others (Darvin, 2017). Digital literacy, in this critical sense, equips individuals with tools and strategies to analyse both linguistic and non-linguistic features of digital media and helps them to identify embedded biases and assumptions (Darvin, 2017).

Critical AI Literacy examines how Large Language Models (LLMs) -AI tools which generate human-like responses -contribute to ongoing epistemic injustices. These injustices can lead to significant social and personal harm by undermining an individual's ability to fully participate in knowledge -sharing and decisionmaking processes.

Critical AI Literacy applies the lens of equality, diversity, inclusion and accessibility (EDIA) to the use of AI. It is essential for fostering a more inclusive and diverse AI education. Being AI-literate in this critical sense means having the tools and strategies to critically evaluate AI-generated outputs using EDIA principles and being able to engage in equitable and inclusive prompting when required. Like Critical Digital Literacy, Critical AI Literacy is context-specific and treats 'literacy' as a 'social practice' , i.e. something individuals do rather than possess.

<!-- image -->

Critical AI Literacy requires 'self -reflective mindsets' (Chiu et al., 2024), which educators increasingly view as essential for lifelong learning about emerging AI technology. Consequently, the latest AI competency definitions emphasise learners' 'confide nce and ability to self-reflect on their AI understanding for further learning' and focus on 'how well individuals use AI in beneficial ways' including for the social or greater good (Chiu et al., 2024, n.p.). It is in this spirit that educators should apply this framework in learning and teaching across the curriculum and at all levels.

## The framework

## AI in society

- Consider the environmental impact of using AI and apply relevant sustainability competencies, e.g. the carbon footprint created through over reliance/excessive use, and the exploitation of labour in the Global South.
- Consider the social, educational and EDIA impact of different AI models and tools (closed/open source, country of origin, ownership).
- Evaluate the societal impact of AI in terms of both workforce exploitation and the impact of the digital divide on users.
- Explore the agency of AI with consideration of control and power across the globe.
- Be mindful of biases in AI outputs, such as gender, cultural, disability, racial or cultural bias, and address them by analysing outputs, cross-referencing sources, and prompting for inclusivity.

## AI careers

- Explore how AI is used in specific disciplines and job sectors, such as Health and Social Care, Banking and Finance, and Transport and Distribution, while applying EDIA principles.
- Apply relevant human skills, e.g. creativity, curiosity, decision-making, empathy and openness when interacting with AI.
- Apply relevant employability skills, e.g., problem-solving, communication and collaboration when interacting with AI.
- Consider opportunities to use AI to enhance employability prospects in a responsible and ethical manner.

## Working with the framework

The framework's structure is based on insights from Sharples' (2024) What to Teach About AI . Individual colleagues and module teams should draw on

<!-- image -->

relevant sections of the framework to upskill themselves in Critical AI Literacy. They should also embed Critical AI Literacy skills development into materials and content whenever opportunities arise, across the curriculum and at all levels.

The process will be iterative rather than linear, fostering greater awareness of how AI developments affect education and life, both positively and negatively, especially in the context of EDIA-related challenges.

The aim is to develop a bank of concrete implementation examples from all subject areas and levels as they become available. Your feedback is welcome, and your collaboration is essential to ensure rigorous quality assurance.

We are also interested in exploring and capturing the experiences of individuals who are committed to engaging more actively with the framework. Contact me, please, if you are willing to share your experience(s): mirjam.hauck@open.ac.uk

## At a more advanced stage of AI use

Get students to explore benefits and limitations of AI -with a particular focus on EDIA principles -through a design process that involves ideation, planning and drafting, expanding, revising, critiquing, polishing, presenting, evaluating and reflecting.

## Levels of Critical AI Literacy

At an advanced level, Critical Digital Literacy (CDL) leverages digital technologies for social justice-oriented action and change (Jiang &amp; Gu, 2022; Mirra &amp; Garcia, 2020). Similarly, advanced Critical AI Literacy examines the potential of AI to shift power. Power relationships are the root cause of inequality in our societies, both in real and material terms. Advanced Critical AI Literacy explores how AI contributes to those inequalities and considers ways in which it could help redress power balances. Advanced Critical AI Literacy is for colleagues and teams seeking to align their teaching approach with the OU's social justice agenda.

Teaching and learning Critical AI Literacy skills at an introductory level aligns with the OU's mission and its Learn and Live strategy, particularly the goals of societal impact, equity and greater diversity, and social sustainability.

The framework aligns with the OU's Enabling Principles for GenAI in Learning, Teaching and Assessment, particularly Principle 2: ' As far as is possible, the use of

<!-- image -->

Generative AI in Learning, Teaching and Assessment is anti-racist, antidiscriminatory, accessible and inclusive '. More specifically, the framework embodies actions and ambitions 2 -4 associated with Principle 2 (Inclusive):

1. Ensure our learning and teaching processes enable students to benefit from this technology wherever and whenever possible.
2. Ensure Equality, Diversity &amp; Inclusion (EDI) and Accessibility are central to our use of Generative AI, addressing issues around fair access to technology and digital inclusion as a priority.
3. Actively educate and deploy tools and techniques to circumvent the inherent biases which exist (or may exist) in Generative AI, particularly those that reinforce existing entrenched colonial perspectives and ways of thinking.
4. Emphasise ethics and trust with absolute transparency, including discussions around existing and emerging risks to security and intellectual property as well as long-term impacts on society.

The framework also speaks to Strategic Priority 1 of the OU's University People Plan, namely, Develop an Inclusive and Empowering Culture and Working Environment.

Finally, the framework also takes account of the five principles agreed on by the Russell Group universities in 2023 created to help universities ensure students and staff are 'AI literate' so they can capitalise on the opportunities that technological breakthroughs provide for teaching and learning. The framework reflects the first three principles in particular:

<!-- image -->

1. Universities will support students and staff to become AI-literate.
2. Staff should be equipped to support students to use Generative AI tools effectively and appropriately in their learning experience.
3. Universities will adapt teaching and assessment to incorporate the ethical use of Generative AI and support equal access.
4. Universities will ensure academic rigour and integrity is upheld.
5. Universities will work collaboratively to share best practice as the technology and its application in education evolves.
