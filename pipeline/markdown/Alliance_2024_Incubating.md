Feminist AI Research Network


<!-- PAGE 2 -->


## Executive Summary

Goal: the f&lt;a+i&gt;r, Feminist AI Research Network, was created to springboard from descriptions of 'why' and 'what',  to  applied  research  on  'how'  new  Feminist  AI and Automated Decision Making (ADM) data, algorithms, models, and systems could concretely and positively  impact  social  /  gender  justice,  improve quality of life, and correct for historic exclusion.

f&lt;a+i&gt;r    aims  to  to  create  new  tools  in  order  to transform old systems. We  investigate, validate, prototype and pilot research hypotheses using multidisciplinary teams, design justice principles, meaningful  community  engagement,  and  public  and private  sector  partnership  aligned  with  our  regional and global approach.

## Impact

Over  2021-2024  f&lt;a+i&gt;r  has  spread  the  idea  of  Feminist  AI  to expand the collective vision beyond critical work on Gender Based Violence (the floor) to a vision of a world where new opportunities abound (the ceiling), and women, girls and marginalized communities are equal partners in decision-taking and tools-making.

## 1 | Quality Research

Using the f&lt;a+i&gt;r paper → prototype → pilot methodology across regions to create multiple pathways multi-stakeholder human rightsbased approaches and design justice principles, new multidisciplinary  teams  of  technologists  and  social  scientists collaborated with communities who became an essential part of the  co-creation  process.  This  approach  enabled ways  to  make sure  the  technology  meets  the  needs  of  women,  girls  and  most marginalized others in vulnerable communities.

## 2 | f&lt;a+i&gt;r pilots

Fostering new forms of multidisciplinary AI thinking and teamwork, catalyzing  new  knowledge  creation, validating  most  promising f&lt;a+i&gt;r research hypotheses and proof of concept to pilot the most effective  prototypes  with  new  partnerships  that  actively  innovate, and correct for historic inequities and sustainability.

## SafeHER: From The Philippines

SafeHER is an AI-driven transit safety app for Manila , a city with one of the most dangerous transport systems in the world  for  women  as  80%  of  women  commuters  report harassment or sexual assault. Developed by a philosophy professor and her tech team, SafeHER merges defensive functions with women's collective action. It also integrates an  active  cooperation  with  Manila  transit  authorities  AND government units.

- Published  in  the  peer  reviewed  Journal  of  Transportation Security  by  Springer, Biana,  H.T.,  Jabar,  M.,  Yabut,  H.  and Domingo,  R.,  2023. Modified  feminist  self-defense:  violence against women in transit in Metro Manila. Journal of Transportation Security, 16(1), p.11., The project has the potential  to  replicate  in  other  densely  populated  urban settings.
- In collaboration with the Philippines' Violence Against Women public  desk,  and  the  Philippines  Commission  on  Women;  for the pilot stage the team conducted successful simulations with local  Manila  police.  Going  forward  De  La  Salle  University  will adopt the app and mainstream it for their female students.

## E.D.I.A. :

In  Argentina  two  female  computer  science  professors from  University  of  Cordoba  teamed  up  with  Via  Libre,  a storied  Buenos  Aires  NGO  to  create a  tool  to  explore natural  language  processing  (NLP)  software  in  order  to identify biases and stereotypes. The team's paper Bias assessment for experts in discrimination, not in computer  science was  accepted  In  Proceedings  of  the First  Workshop  on  Cross-Cultural  Considerations  in  NLP (C3NLP) (pp.  91-106),  Alemany,  L.A.,  Benotti,  L.,  Maina,  H., Gonzalez,  L.,  Martínez,  L.,  Busaniche,  B.,  Halvorsen,  A., Rojo, A. and Rajngewerc, M., 2023, May.

- A  fast  moving  tech  environment  became  an  actor  in  the evolution  of  the  tool.  Prior  to  the  prototype  phase,  only auditing  through  single  word  detection  was  possible.  But  6 months later, in the 2022 prototype phase, contextual detection  and  inspection  of  bias,  as  well  as  intersectional analysis,  became  possible.  The  team  built  and  shared  their prototype on hugging face allowing users to define the type of bias they wished to explore and to understand bias through an intersectional analysis by considering two binary dimensions, such as female-male intersected with fat-skinny.
- In the pilot phase the team is further democratizing the tool, broadening  reach  by  training  500  Argentinean  high  school teachers to use and teach the tool in their classes. The goal: community-centered  methods  to  build  a  language  dataset which represents stereotypes in Argentina. E.D.I.A. replication in  other  languages  and  contexts  are  planned  with  the  cocreation of structured content and teaching materials.
- E.D.I.A received the prestigious Mozilla Data Futures Lab 2024 Infrastructure Fund Award, In addition to f&lt;a+i&gt;r pilot funding.

## AymurAI:

Measuring Gender Based Violence in Latin America, a collaboration between feminist NGO Data Género and  Criminal  Court  10  in  Buenos  Aires,  Argentina. AymurAI is a software that anonymizes documents, collects and makes  available data  on  gender violence  from  judicial  sentences. AymurAI's  long term goal is to offer access to artificial intelligence technologies that allow the automatic extraction of statistical  data  on  gender  violence  and  improve transparency in the judiciary in Latin America.

- The paper mapped out the theory, and the prototype involved a collaboration with a judge and staff running Criminal  Court  10  in  Buenos  Aires  in  order  to  easily open their data to document and make public the high rate of femicide.
- AymurAI  is  now  a  case  study  in UNESCO's  Global toolkit on AI and the rule of law for the judiciary,
- AymurAI received funding from the McGovern Foundation to  continue  beyond  the  f&lt;a+i&gt;r  grant  to expand and deploy the project to more criminal courts in Argentina, in Mexico and beyond.

## 3 | f&lt;a+i&gt;r Regional Hubs

The  decentralized  Hubs  have  played  the  role  of  critical connectors  by  socializing  feminist  AI  concepts  across projects and  collaborators in their respective regions. Uniquely  strengthening  the  capacity  of  regional  actors, building a field of inter- and intra-regional multi-disciplinary teams, deepening understanding of each region's distinctive needs, the Hubs leverage learnings on collective solutions, and nurture the roots of Feminist AI in the global south.

- Latin America &amp; the Caribbean: Tecnológico de Monterrey led by Professor Paola Ricaurte Quijano
- South East Asia: Chulalongkorn University led by Professors Soraj Hongladarom / Supavadee Aramvith
- Middle  East  &amp;  North  Africa:  Access  to  Knowledge  for Development Center (A2K4D), at the American University in Cairo's School of Business led by Professor Nagla Rizk.

The three hubs operate as distinct entities,  each  bringing unique  perspectives  and  approaches  to  the  landscape  of feminist  thought  and  praxis.  Despite  separate  viewpoints and  methodologies  they  have  succeeded  collectively  at unifying  diverse  approaches  to  build  a  groundbreaking feminist movement. Through the collective effort, the new concept of feminist AI was advanced in a way that honors and leverages the rich vocabularies and schools of thoughts within the network.

## About The &lt;A+&gt; Alliance and the f&lt;a+i&gt;r network

The &lt;A+&gt; Alliance is a global feminist coalition of technologists, activists  and  academics    with  a  mission  to  create  a  paradigm shift  for  AI  and  associated  Automated  Decision-Making  to  a focus  on  systems  change  in  support  of  inclusive  democratic processes and gender transformative policy and structures.  It is dedicated to creating a new body of feminist AI knowledge and models with and from the global South.

In 2020, with the support of IDRC, the &lt;A+&gt; Alliance launched f&lt;a+i&gt;r  the Feminist AI Research Network to build upon  &lt;A+&gt; Alliance's 2019 Declaration for Affirmative Action for Algorithms which has served as a mothership for the process.  Co-founded in 2019 by Women at the Table and Ciudadania Inteligente, the Alliance has been led from 2021-2024 by Women at the Table &amp; Tecnologico de Costa Rica.

## Lessons Learnt

Baseline on Feminist AI Since no one knows what Feminist AI is, and  as  it  can  and  could  be  many  things  to  many  people,  the baseline  concepts  of  gender  justice,  JEDI,  Design  Justice,  all need to be shared. The inclusion of workshops for prospective/new  grantees  on  intersectional,  feminist  issues proved essential to develop a common  vision, train AI developers on feminist principles, and create the foundation for systematizing learnings from previous cohorts on methodologies.

- Community Engagement principles are critical for teams to be able to ideate and create Feminist AI as a multidisciplinary  approach  as  team  members  come  from different perspectives with different vocabularies.

Genuine  Community  involvement: Community  engagement  is sine qua non to this process.

- More research could be done on how to effectively reach out to and then create and validate methodologies to fully and meaningfully engage communities in the co-creation of new and  emerging  technologies  that  serve  the  needs  of the community and the most marginalized.

Bi Weekly meetings proved to have great impact encouraging teams to move forward in the compressed timeline, avoid less useful  avenues  of  investigation  and  produce  highly  regarded research published in global journals, presented at prestigious conferences,  and  garner  further  funding  from  the  institutions such as McGovern Foundation, Mozilla, etc.

- Bi  Weekly  meetings  not  only  built  trust  but  also  strong relationships within the larger network, transforming grantorgrantee relationships into a critical community of researchers and technologists that value collaboration and bold experimentations.

Funding: Not  every  project  prototype  or  pilot  needs  the  same amounts  of  funding.  A  more  effective  method  was  found  in Cohort IV when funding was linked to fully formed prototype / pilot  work  plans  and  budget.  Some  projects  needed  more funding to be effective, others less.

Creative  freedom for researchers is key and the close alignment with expressions of interest into papers, prototypes and pilots allowed for researchers to make significant progress vis à vis the bi weekly meetings on one hand, and to have the freedom  to  experiment,  ideate  and  pivot  their  means  and methods on the other hand.

## Recommendations

## Engagement and advocacy

- Build on the momentum of the validated paper - prototypepilot methodology
- Give visibility to the utility of the technologies built
- Showcase  the  network's  feminist  AI  research,  tools, frameworks and debate to a wider audience
- Expand the Global Directory through a dedicated global communication campaign, highlighting the groundbreaking work undertaken by feminist leaders in the global majority, to  allow  the  community  to  build  partnerships  across  the world.
- Increase the capacity of the global coordination team with a  new  further  emphasis  on  African  and  Asian  talent  and practitioners.
- Enhance  introduction  of  feminist  AI  with  humanities, gender, social protection, and policy communities.
- Continue to socialize gender-transformative approaches and  feminist  AI  to  technical  and  computer  science communities: Be  sensitive  to  the  reality  that  academics are rewarded when they publish in their specific discipline's journals. Be aware that multidisciplinary approaches  are  not  highly  rewarded  currently.  This  is  a continuing obstacle.

## Partnerships, Collaborations and Capacity Building

- Continue offering modules about technical concepts and terminologies to interdisciplinary teams (In addition to SAC innovation social science capacity building workshops). This would  support  teams'  to  develop  the  prototype  proposal, and embark on the prototype development phase.
- Develop the AI &amp; Equality Human Rights Toolbox, further tailoring  it  to  specific  regional  contexts,  p.ex,  African context with ground examples and experiences. The latter can work alongside the Africa outreach strategy and build further on the learnings and outcomes from the Incubating Feminist AI grant.
- Systematize  informal  and  formal  meetings  with  relevant institutions and  boundary  partners. This may  set the grounds for co-creation to involve the partners identified in the original Incubating  Feminist  AI proposal  (e.g.  trade unions, municipalities, national commissions); and to present solutions  ( Digital  Public  Infrastructure work  may  be  one such collaborative opportunity).

## Outreach and funding

- Open opportunities for funding further papers, prototypes and pilots with interdisciplinary outlooks and approaches. Explore  multiple  publishing  avenues  and  formats:  peerreviewed articles, op-eds, news articles, and creative essays in addition to podcasts and webinars. It's important for  the  network  to  exist  beyond  the  academy,  and  to socialize  its  jargon  and  approach  to  developing  feminist technologies with communities that can benefit. ?
- A  broader  grassroot  and  outreach  to  policy  makers, feminists, digital rights and activists, human rights defenders, critical and responsible AI institutions will build visibility  and  generate  new  partnerships  with  researchers, civil society, and government  stakeholders: widen the dissemination  of  knowledge  to  showcase  the  network's applied research, and debate to a general public audience. To do this, the network may consider funding a communications strategy/campaign.
