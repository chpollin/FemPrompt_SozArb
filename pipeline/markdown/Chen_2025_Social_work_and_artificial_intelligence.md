<!-- PAGE 2 -->


## 1.2 Literature Review and Research Motivation

Previous  research  on  the  integration  of  AI  and  social  work  has  primarily  focused  on  technical applications, such as using AI for risk assessment, case classification, and automated management (Abtahi et al., 2023; Chan &amp; Holosko, 2016; Chatterjee &amp; Chakraborty, 2021; Goldkind et al., 2018; Mishna et al., 2021; Recmanová  et  al.,  2022).  However,  there  has  been  relatively  limited  in-depth  exploration  of  the  specific challenges related to social work ethics, humanistic care, and professional decision-making processes. Given that social work involves sensitive information about clients and requires nuanced contextual understanding and ethical judgment, a purely technology-driven approach to AI may overlook these core professional values (Reamer, 2018; Rodríguez-Martínez et al.,  2024).  Additionally,  social  workers'  acceptance  and trust in AI remain critical issues (Biden, 2023; Chen, 2023; Eubanks, 2018; Holmes et al., 2022; Huang et al., 2022; Raso et al., 2018; Zhang &amp; Zhang, 2023).

## 1.3 Research Objectives and Significance

This study aims to  adopt an  integrated  theoretical  and  practical  perspective  to  thoroughly  examine how  AI  technology  can  effectively  collaborate  with  the  social  work  profession  while  analyzing  potential ethical, humanistic, and technical challenges. Through qualitative research methods, including interviews with social  work  professionals,  AI  developers,  and  policymakers,  this  study  seeks  to  address  gaps  in  existing research and propose more concrete and actionable integration strategies.

The significance of this study lies in:

1. Providing empirical data on AI applications in social work, supplementing the current technologydominated research;
2. Emphasizing the importance of ethics and human-centered values in the implementation of AI in social work practice;
3. Advancing theoretical development and practical innovation in social work amid digital transformation.

## 3. Discussion

## 3.1 Enhancing Social Work Efficiency through AI Technology

This study demonstrates that artificial intelligence (AI) technology significantly improves efficiency in  social  work  practice.  Empirical  data  reveal  that  90%  of  social  work  professionals  acknowledge  AI's substantial auxiliary function in daily operations, particularly in case screening, risk prediction, and resource matching.  Specifically,  AI  systems  enable  practitioners  to  rapidly  identify  high-risk  populations  through comprehensive case data analysis, facilitating early intervention while reducing human resource expenditure and enhancing service precision.

The application of AI in resource matching has received particular recognition. Traditional resource allocation relying on manual judgment often suffers from information gaps or human bias. In contrast, AI


<!-- PAGE 7 -->


systems  can  integrate  data  across  multiple  resource  platforms  in  real-time,  matching  clients  with  optimal service options, thereby improving both service accessibility and resource utilization efficiency.

Furthermore, AI-driven automation of administrative tasks (e.g., case progress tracking, documentation) substantially reduces practitioners' bureaucratic burdens, allowing greater focus on high-level professional  interventions  and  interpersonal  engagement.  Most  participants  reported  that  AI  tools  for  data organization and preliminary screening have effectively liberated significant working hours, contributing to enhanced service quality and job satisfaction.

However,  some  respondents noted current AI applications primarily handle structured data, demonstrating limited capability in processing unstructured information (e.g., interview transcripts, emotional tone analysis), which constrains their effectiveness in highly complex scenarios.

In  conclusion,  while  AI  technology  positively  impacts  social  work  efficiency,  its  role  should  be positioned as a professional aid rather than replacement. Future development requires continuous technological refinement coupled with enhanced digital literacy training for practitioners to achieve optimal human-AI collaborative service models.

## 3.2 Decision Transparency and Acceptance Challenges

The  study  reveals  that  while  AI  demonstrates  potential  for  enhancing  social  work  efficiency, significant  concerns  persist  regarding  decision-making  transparency.  Approximately  80%  of  AI  developers and a majority of social work professionals characterize current AI systems as operating through 'black-box' mechanisms that lack clear explanations of their decision-making processes, creating substantial barriers to user understanding and trust.

Social  work  participants  reported  particular  difficulties  when  AI  recommendations  involve  lifealtering  or  sensitive  case  decisions.  Without  transparent  insight  into  the  data  parameters  and  logical frameworks underlying AI suggestions, practitioners find it professionally challenging to fully rely on system outputs, often leading to dismissal of AI-generated advice. Furthermore, when AI models fail to account for cultural  differences,  social  contexts,  or  individual  variations,  they  risk  producing  biased  conclusions  that further erode system acceptance and trustworthiness.

Notably,  AI  developers  themselves  recognize  these  explainability  limitations  as  adoption  barriers. Some have begun implementing Explainable AI (XAI) techniques like Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) or SHAP value analysis to enhance model interpretability and communication of results. However, such solutions remain minimally integrated into practice settings.

In conclusion, widespread AI adoption in social work must prioritize enhanced decision transparency. Future system designs should incorporate:

1. Concrete, intuitive explanations of decision rationales
2. Contextualized digital literacy training for practitioners
3. Mechanisms balancing technological assistance with professional accountability

This multifaceted approach will foster the trust required for effective human-AI collaboration while maintaining ethical practice standards. The development of domain-specific explanatory frameworks - rather than  generic  transparency  tools  -  emerges  as  a  critical  need  for  the  field's  responsible  technological integration.

## 3.3 The Critical Importance of AI Ethics and Regulation

This study highlights the fundamental role of ethical frameworks and legal regulations in ensuring the sustainable  development of AI applications within social work. Findings from focus groups and individual interviews reveal unanimous consensus (100%) among policymakers that advancing AI technologies must be accompanied by robust ethical guidelines and legal standards to safeguard client rights and maintain societal trust.


<!-- PAGE 8 -->


Key concerns emerged regarding current deficiencies in ethical oversight mechanisms for AI implementation in social work practice. Participants particularly emphasized the absence of clear standards governing:

1. Data ownership in client information collection
2. Permissible usage boundaries
3. Disclosure obligations

This regulatory gap substantially increases risks of data misuse and privacy violations.

Furthermore,  both  social  work  practitioners  and  technology  developers  identified  critical  liability issues requiring legal clarification - particularly concerning responsibility allocation when AI system errors lead to service failures. Such uncertainty was reported to significantly hinder professional willingness to adopt AI technologies.

Based  on  these  findings,  the  study  proposes  four  essential  directions  for  strengthening  ethical  and regulatory frameworks:

1. Domain-Specific Ethical Guidelines : Development of AI application standards tailored to social work contexts
2. Transparent Data Governance : Policies ensuring data subjects' informed consent and autonomy
3. Legal  Accountability  Mechanisms :  Clear  liability  attribution  and  redress  procedures  for  AI system errors
4. Interdisciplinary Oversight : Cross-sector regulatory bodies to monitor compliance and equity in AI deployment

The study concludes that only through such comprehensive ethical-legal infrastructure can the field properly  balance  technological  innovation  with  human  rights  protection,  thereby  establishing  a  sustainable foundation for AI integration in social work practice.

## 3.4 AI Training Needs for Social Work Professionals

This study identifies a significant gap in current training systems to adequately prepare social workers for AI integration challenges. Survey data reveals that 92% of participating social work professionals consider existing  training  programs  insufficient  in  addressing  AI  applications,  resulting  in  substantial  difficulties  in understanding and utilizing AI tools in practice.

Key findings demonstrate that:

1. Knowledge  Deficits :  Lack  of  fundamental  AI  operational  knowledge  fosters  resistance  or distrust toward emerging technologies among practitioners
2. Application  Barriers :  Without  basic  comprehension  of  AI  system  logic  and output interpretation, professionals struggle to effectively employ AI assistance, risking potential misuse that could compromise service quality and professional judgment

To address these challenges, the study proposes comprehensive educational reforms:

## 1. Academic Training:

- a. Incorporate essential AI knowledge (machine learning fundamentals, data ethics, algorithmic bias recognition) into core social work curricula
- b. Develop  interdisciplinary  learning  models  facilitating  collaborative  projects  between  social work and technology students to foster mutual professional understanding

## 2. Professional Development:

- a. Implement practice-oriented AI workshops featuring:
- Real-case simulations
- Ethical dilemma exercises
- Human-AI collaboration drills


<!-- PAGE 9 -->


- b. Establish  continuing  education  programs  tailored  to  working  professionals'  competency levels

The  study  concludes  that  maintaining  social  work's  professional  relevance  in  the  digital  era necessitates proactive AI competency development. Transforming education and training systems represents the foundational requirement for successful AI-social work integration, ensuring practitioners can critically engage with technological tools while preserving core professional values.

## 3.5 Study Limitations and Future Research Directions

While this study contributes to understanding the applications and challenges of artificial intelligence (AI) in social work practice, several limitations must be acknowledged and addressed in future research.

First,  the  study  primarily  employed  qualitative  methods,  including  in-depth  interviews  and  focus groups, with a sample  size that, while diverse in professional backgrounds,  remained  limited and geographically concentrated, potentially affecting the external validity of the findings. Future research should expand the sample size to include social work practitioners from varied cultural and institutional contexts to enhance the generalizability of results.

Second, although thematic analysis was rigorously applied with multiple verification steps to ensure reliability,  the  interpretive  nature  of  qualitative  research  inherently  carries  the  possibility  of  researcher subjectivity.  Complementing  qualitative  findings  with  quantitative  methods,  such  as  structured  surveys  or experimental  designs,  could  provide  large-scale  statistical  validation  of  participant  attitudes  and  behaviors, improving objectivity and reproducibility.

Additionally, this  study  focused  on  current  AI  applications  and  participant  experiences  but  did  not assess long-term outcomes of AI integration in social work. Longitudinal studies tracking the sustained impact of AI adoption on service outcomes, client well-being, and the evolving role of social workers are needed.

Finally,  while  ethical  and  regulatory  considerations  were  explored,  deeper  institutional  and  crossnational  comparative  analyses  remain  underdeveloped.  Future  studies  should  examine  differences  in  AI governance frameworks, professional regulations, and technological development strategies across countries to offer more globally relevant insights for social work's digital transformation.

In summary, this study provides an initial empirical exploration of AI integration in social work, and future research should further advance this field by refining methodologies, diversifying samples, deepening analytical  perspectives,  and  strengthening  cross-disciplinary  and  cross-national  comparisons  to  foster  both theoretical and practical innovation.

## 4. Conclusion

This  study  examines  the  opportunities  and  challenges  of  integrating  artificial  intelligence  (AI) technologies into social work practice. Findings demonstrate AI's significant potential to enhance operational efficiency  and  support  decision-making,  particularly  in  risk  assessment  and  real-time  case  management. However,  the  research  simultaneously  reveals  that  AI  cannot  fully  replace  social  workers'  professional judgment  or  the  nuanced  interpersonal  skills  fundamental  to  the  profession,  as  humanistic  care  and individualized services remain core values of social work practice.

A  key  contribution  of  this  study  lies  in  elucidating  the  ethical  considerations  accompanying  AI integration,  particularly  regarding  client  privacy  protection  and  decision-making  transparency.  Through examining Explainable AI (XAI) applications, we recommend that future AI system development prioritize addressing practitioners' ethical concerns to enhance both technological reliability and professional acceptance.

Furthermore, the study emphasizes the critical need for enhanced AI literacy among social workers. Educational and training systems must evolve to provide relevant curricula and skill development, ensuring


<!-- PAGE 10 -->


professionals can effectively adapt to technological advancements while integrating humanistic and technical competencies.

These findings bridge theoretical and practical gaps in understanding AI-social work integration while providing  concrete  recommendations  for  practice  and  future  research.  Subsequent  studies  should  employ larger-scale  quantitative  methods  to  validate  these  qualitative  findings  and  further  explore  the  dynamic interplay  between  technology,  humanistic  values,  and  ethical  practice.  Such  continued  examination  will promote the responsible development and harmonious implementation of AI technologies within the social work profession during this digital transformation era.
