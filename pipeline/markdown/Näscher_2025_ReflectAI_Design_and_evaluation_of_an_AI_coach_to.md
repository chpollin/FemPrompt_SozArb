## Preface

The  EGOV-CeDEM-ePart  2025  conference,  for  short  EGOV  2025,  was  organized  by the  IFIP  WG  8.5  Information  Systems  in  Public  Administration.  The  conference  is  dedicated  to  digital  or  electronic  government,  open  government,  local  government  (smart cities), smart governance, artificial intelligence (AI), e-democracy, policy informatics,  and  electronic  participation.  With  a  long  tradition  along  its  various  branches,  the EGOV-CeDEM-ePart  conference  has  gained  its  reputation  of  being  the  key  and  leading conference  worldwide  in  the  research  domains  of  digital/electronic,  open,  and  smart government,  as  well  as  electronic  participation.

The  call  for  papers  attracted  completed  research  papers,  work-in-progress  papers on ongoing  research (including doctoral papers), posters, as well as  workshops  and practitioner  papers.  This  volume  contains  only  full  research  papers.  All  submissions were  assessed  through  a  double-blind  peer-review  process,  with  at  least  three  reviewers per  submission,  and  48  papers  were  accepted  from  116  submissions  (an  acceptance  rate of  41%).  The  submitted  papers  were  of  high  quality,  and  many  reviewers  indicated  that the  topics  of  the  papers  they  reviewed  were  novel.

The  review  process  was  based  on  a  double-blind  reviewing  process  and  conflicts of  interest  were  actively  avoided.  Authors  of  papers  submitted  their  papers  to  a  track. The  track  chairs  had  access  only  to  the  papers  within  their  own  track  and  could  assign reviewers  and  propose  acceptance  decisions.  The  lead  track  chairs  were  editors  of  the proceedings,  in  addition  to  the  general  chairs.  Track  chairs  were  not  allowed  to  submit  to their  own  track,  nor  were  their  close  collaborators,  to  avoid  any  conflict  of  interest.  Track chairs  could  either  submit  to  another  track  or  to  the  'track  chairs'  track.  The  latter  was handled  by  one  of  the  general  chairs,  and  these  submissions  were  reviewed  in  the  same way  as  all  other  submissions.  The  general  chairs  checked  after  the  submission  deadline whether  there  was  any  conflict  of  interest  among  the  papers  submitted  to  tracks,  and  if so,  the  respective  paper  was  moved  to  another  track.  The  track  chairs  checked  that  all papers  were  submitted  anonymously.  If  not,  the  authors  were  asked  to  resubmit  within  a couple  of  days.  Track  chairs  assigned  the  reviewers  and  selected  the  program  committee members  in  such  a  way  that  experts  in  each  area  reviewed  the  papers  and  there  were  no conflicts  of  interest.  After  at  least  three  reviews  were  received,  the  track  chairs  made  a proposal  for  a  decision  per  paper.  The  decisions  were  discussed  in  a  meeting  with  the general  and  track  chairs  to  ensure  that  the  decisions  were  made  in  a  consistent  manner across  tracks.

Among  the  full  research  paper  submissions,  21  papers  (empirical  and  conceptual) were  accepted  for  this  year's  Springer  LNCS  ePart  proceedings  (vol.  15978).  This  volume includes  papers  distributed  over  the  following  tracks:

- General  eDemocracy  &amp;  eParticipation
- Governance,  Digital  Legislation,  and  Policy
- Digital  Technologies  and  Sustainable  Development
- Managing  e-Government  Projects

## · Digital  Society

Artificial  Intelligence  Governance  and  its  Societal  Challenges

As  in  the  previous  years  and  per  the  recommendation  of  the  Paper  Awards  Committee,  under  the  leadership  of  Manuel  Pedro  Rodríguez  Bolívar  from  the  University  of Granada,  Spain,  and  Noella  Edelmann  from  the  University  for  Continuing  Education Krems,  Austria,  the  IFIP  EGOV-CeDEM-ePart  2025  conference  granted  outstanding paper  awards  in  three  distinct  categories:

- The  most  innovative  research  contribution
- The  most  promising  practical  concept
- The  most  compelling  critical  research  reflection

The  winners  in  each  category  were  announced  during  the  awards  ceremony  at  the conference.

The  IFIP  EGOV  2025  conference  was  hosted  in  Austria,  at  the  University  for  Continuing  Education  Krems.  The  conference  sessions  were  hosted  2-4  September  at  the University  for  Continuing  Education  Krems'  Campus.  The  University  for  Continuing Education  Krems  is  Europe's  leading  public  university  dedicated  to  continuing  education,  combining  teaching  excellence  with  cutting-edge  research  to  address  key  societal challenges.  Located  in  the  vibrant  and  historic  city  of  Krems  an  der  Donau,  the  university thrives  within  a  rich  academic  and  cultural  environment,  surrounded  by  the  charm  and legacy  of  one  of  Austria's  oldest  cities.  As  part  of  the  conference,  the  PhD  colloquium and  the  Junior  Faculty  School  were  hosted  at  Göttweig  Abbey,  a  historic  Benedictine monastery  situated  atop  a  hill  in  Austria's  Wachau  Valley.  Known  for  its  impressive baroque  architecture,  Göttweig  Abbey  offers  a  setting  that  blends  historical  significance with  a  peaceful  atmosphere,  ideal  for  focused  academic  discussions.  With  origins  dating  back  to  the  eleventh  century,  the  monastery  provided  a  unique  context  for  scholarly exchange.  The  PhD  Colloquium  was  a  full-day  event  on  31  August,  open  only  to  those who  were  admitted,  and  offered  a  limited  number  of  PhD  bursaries.  The  Junior  Faculty School  was  a  full-day  event  on  1  September,  for  sharing  experiences  to  advance  the career  of  young  researchers  interested  in  digitalization  and  government.

Many  people  behind  the  scenes  make  large  events  like  this  conference  happen.  We would  like  to  thank  the  members  of  the  Program  Committee,  the  reviewers,  and  the  track chairs  for  their  great  efforts  in  reviewing  the  submitted  papers.  We  would  also  like  to express  our  deep  gratitude  to  Peter  Parycek,  Gabriela  Viale  Pereira,  and  their  local  team at  the  University  for  Continuing  Education  Krems  for  hosting  the  conference.

The  papers  in  these  proceedings  range  from  societal  to  scientific,  and  from  rigorous to  innovative.  We  hope  you  enjoy  reading  them!

Abstract. The  widespread  use  of  ICT  and  the  internet  has  compelled  governments  worldwide  to  rethink  how  they  engage  in  dialogue  with  citizens.  These technology-mediated  interactions  have  given  rise  to  eParticipation,  a  concept  with significant  potential  to  address  democratic  deficits.  However,  ensuring  meaningful  and  inclusive  participation  requires  that  all  citizens  have  equal  opportunities to  engage  while  barriers  faced  by  disadvantaged  groups  are  actively  addressed. This  systematic  literature  review  conceptualizes  the  dimensions  for  inclusive  eParticipation,  through  27  included  articles  from  across  5  databases.  19  dimensions have  been  identified  within  6  concepts  for  inclusion  in  digital  participation - accessibility,  knowledge,  motivation,  safety,  impact,  and  empowerment.  We  propose  a new  conceptual  framework  from  these  findings,  which  can  guide  efforts  towards understanding  and  enhancing  inclusion  in  digital  democratic  engagement.

Keywords: eParticipation · inclusion · systematic  literature  review

## 1 Introduction

The  pervasive  use  of  Information  and  Communication  Technology  (ICT)  and  the  internet infrastructure  has  forced  governments  all  over  the  world  to  redefine  the  way  they  engage in  dialogue  with  citizens.  Today,  over  80%  of  United  Nations  Member  States  utilize  their potential  for  public  governance  [1].  Citizen  participation  in  decision-making  processes  is a  core  principle  of  democracy  [2],  and  the  integration  of  technology  into  these  interactions has  given  rise  to  the  concept  of  electronic  participation,  or  eParticipation.  According  to the  UN  [3],  eParticipation  is  essential  for  better  access  to  information  and  public  services, while  allowing  citizens  to  be  part  of  decision-making  processes  concerning  their  lives. As  a  pillar  of  socially  inclusive  governance,  it  directly  impacts  both  individual  well-being and  society  as  a  whole.

While  the  adoption  of  ICT  can  increase  accountability,  transparency,  and  legitimacy in governance  [1], it does not automatically enhance eParticipation -especially for marginalized  groups  [4].  Although  ICT  use  is  intended  to  expand  citizen  engagement  [5], in  practice,  new  barriers  arise,  some  of  which  result  from  persistent  inequalities  in  their access  and  use-  known  as  the  digital  divide  [4].  Even  among  those  who  overcome  this

divide,  barriers  may  persist,  as  some  individuals  may  feel  that  their  voices  are  ignored or  not  equally  valued  throughout  the  participation  processes  [6].  Any  of  these  disparities manifests  unequal  participation,  leaving  underserved  populations  underrepresented  or without  a  meaningful  platform  to  express  their  views  [7].

As  Brabham  [8]  notes,  'any  democratic  model  is  problematic  if  it  is  predicated  on access  to  something  that  not  everyone  has  access  to'  (p.  255).  Citizen  participation  can only  be  considered  meaningful  if  equitable  participation  opportunities  are  guaranteed  for all  individuals  [9].  As  Cornwall  [6]  underlines,  it  is  essential  to  examine  who  participates, who  is  excluded,  and  who  excludes  themselves,  while  developing  strategies  to  mitigate these  disparities.  Similarly,  the  commitment  to  'leaving  no  one  behind',  a  central  principle  of  the  UN  2030  Agenda  for  Sustainable  Development,  demands  explicit  efforts  to meaningfully  and  actively  include  marginalized  groups  in  participatory  processes.

Although  principles  of  inclusion  are  commonly  underlined,  research  in  eParticipation  has  not  kept  pace  with  these  commitments.  It  has  been  nearly  20  years  since  early eParticipation  characterizing  and  theorizing  efforts  were  recognized  [4,  10].  Yet,  significant  research  gaps  persist  due  to  a  diversity  of  conceptualizations  [11],  and  the  complex nature  of  the  interdisciplinary  play  of  technological,  political,  and  social  factors  [12]. Contemporary  studies  in  eParticipation  overlook  the  complexity  of  balancing  diverse interests  in  a  fair  and  equal  manner  [13]  while  placing  disproportionate  emphasis  on technological  aspects  [14].  As  a  result,  current  frameworks  often  fail  to  comprehensively  address  the  social  and  structural  barriers  of  achieving  inclusive  eParticipation. Further  research  is  therefore  needed  to  move  beyond  the  technical  frames  and  better account  for  the  diverse  needs,  capabilities,  and  motivations  for  engagement  across  citizens  of  various  socio-demographics  backgrounds  [9,  10].  This  is  the  only  way  to  improve the  inclusion  capacity  for  eParticipation-leaving  no  one  behind  [1].

To  bridge  these  gaps,  it  is  essential  to  first  understand  and  conceptualize  what  inclusion  in  the  eParticipation  context  truly  means.  With  this  objective  in  mind,  our  research aims  to  answer  the  question: 'How  can  inclusive  eParticipation  be  conceptualized?'. By  systematically  synthesizing  literature  across  five  academic  databases,  we  propose  a conceptual  framework  with  corresponding  dimensions,  which  can  support  practitioners with  a  standardized  approach  to  assess  and  improve  inclusion,  ultimately  leading  to  best practices.

## 2 Background  of  eParticipation  and  Inclusion

eParticipation  is  a  concept  that  has  emerged  due  to  the  digitalization  of  participatory spaces.  It  comes  from  the  diffusion  of  two  elements - 'e(lectronic)',  implying  the  use of ICT, with 'participation', which  refers to public involvement  in deliberation and decision-making  processes  [10].  Tools  that  can  facilitate  participatory  activities  are  of great  variety,  including  chat  technologies,  discussion  forums,  electronic  voting  systems, web  portals,  social  media,  groupware,  weblogs,  visualization  tools,  and  more  [10,  15, 16].  eParticipation  is  viewed  as  solution  to  growing  political  dissatisfaction  and  declining trust in public institutions [17],  as  it  provides  citizens  with  effective  communication and  informed  decision-making  tools,  while  improving  the  efficiency  and  legitimacy  of political  processes  for  governments  [10].

According  to  United  Nations  [3],  eParticipation  formats  include  eInformation,  eConsultation  and  eDecision-making.  eInformation  refers  to  the  use  of  digital  tools  to  provide  citizens  timely  access  to  public  information.  eConsultation  tools,  on  the  other  hand, enable  citizens  to  engage  in  discussions  through  real-time  interactions,  or  archived  audio and  video  recordings  of  public  meetings.  eDecision-making  goes  a  step  further  by  incorporating  citizen  input  into  the  final  decisions  and  following-up  on  how  these  contributions  have  influenced  the  policymaking  outcomes.  eParticipation  spans  a  wide  range  of areas,  including  polling,  voting,  campaigning,  participatory  law-making,  electioneering, cultural  politics,  urban  and  spatial  planning,  and  more  [15].

While  technologies  that  facilitate  engagement  are  rapidly  evolving,  the  field  of  eParticipation  is  still  at  a  relatively  early  stage  [4,  15,  16].  Research  has  primarily  focused  on the  technological  aspects,  while  the  social  issues  remain  underexplored;  an  imbalance Medaglia  [14]  argues  must  be  addressed.  To  advance  the  field,  it  is  crucial  to  understand and  navigate  these  challenges,  ensuring  that  eParticipation  not  only  leverages  technology effectively,  but  also  balances  the  benefits  and  social  risks  at  play.

The  concepts  of  inclusion  and  exclusion  were  first  coined  in  European  policy  discourse  as  broader  alternatives  to  the  narrower  concept  of  poverty  [18].  The  shift  was deemed  necessary  in  order  to  acknowledge  that  people  who  were  unable  to  integrate into  mainstream  society,  were  excluded  not  only  because  of  income  deprivation,  but also  due  to  educational,  employment,  cultural,  social  and  political  factors.  Mancinelli [19]  views  these  as  factors  of  disadvantage,  which  can  define  'the  relative  position  that an  individual  or  a  group  has  in  the  whole  context  of  the  society.'

Two  key  areas  of  social  exclusion  are  emphasized  by  Rawal  [18]  to  be  exclusion  from i)  participation  in  civil  society  and  ii)  social  arenas-both  linked  to  eParticipation.  The importance  for  eParticipation  processes  to  be  inclusive  and  fair  to  all  segments  of  society is commonly  underlined  [9,  20]. However,  'inclusion' is a fluid,  multidimensional, ambiguous  concept,  that  adapts  to  different  contexts  and  is  therefore  difficult  to  measure and  operationalize  [18].  Some  eParticipation  literature  links  issues  of  inclusion  to  the digital  divide.  Digital  technologies  are  not  equally  accessible  for  everyone - an  issue amplified  by  differences  in  digital  literacy  and  skills  [20].  Unequal  adoption  and  access to  ICT  deepens  the  gap  between  those  who  can  effectively  use  these  tools  and  benefit  from their  advantages,  and  those  who  cannot  [19].  Beyond  the  digital  divide,  some  studies also  consider  broader  aspects  of  inclusion.  Mariani  et  al.  [21],  for  instance,  highlight  the importance  of  ensuring  diversity,  representativeness,  and  a  balance  of  different  voices  in decision-making  processes.  This  is  echoed  by  Östling  [22],  who  raises  concerns  about the  equality  of  eParticipation,  ensuring  that  no  particular  group  or  interest  dominates the  process,  and  that  there  is  no  discrimination  against  specific  groups.  It  is  therefore not  sufficient  that  access  to  the  participatory  tool  is  granted,  the  public  should  also  feel that  their  voices  matter,  and  that  the  process  is  both  effective  and  fair  [6].  True  inclusion means  that  everyone  has  a  meaningful  opportunity  to  shape  decisions.

Ensuring  equality  and  inclusion  in  eParticipation  is  critical  for  maintaining  democratic  quality,  and  evaluating  these  processes  is  the  only  way  to  address  shortcomings. However,  as  there  is  no  established  understanding  of  what  inclusion  entails,  this  concept

is  difficult  to  measure.  A  conceptual  framework  is  necessary  to  clarify  the  core  dimensions  of  inclusion  in  eParticipation,  while  integrating  findings  from  diverse  disciplines to  create  a  holistic  understanding.

## 3 Research  Methodology

This  study  employs  a  Systematic  Literature  Review  (SLR),  which  is  a  highly  structured, and  reproducible  method  'for  identifying,  evaluating,  and  synthesizing  the  existing  body of  completed  and  recorded  work  produced  by  researchers,  scholars,  and  practitioners' (p.  6)  [23].  Considering  that  the  SLR  can  identify  what  is  known  or  unknown  about a research topic [24],  while  providing  'evidence  that  the  phenomenon  is  robust  and transferable'  (p.  2)  [25],  we  find  it  to  be  a  highly  suitable  approach  to  research  the  phenomenon  of  focus  for  this  study - inclusion  in  eParticipation.  This  systematic  review  follows  the  eight-step  guideline  by  Okoli  [26],  with  the  four  phases  of  Planning,  Selection, Extraction,  and  Execution  which  ensure  a  rigorous  methodological  process.

Planning. The  first  two  steps  of  the  review  involved  developing  a  search  strategy and  a  detailed  protocol,  to  ensure  consistency  throughout  the  process  and  among  the authors. The  search was  developed  in concert with the research question, to clearly reflect  the  review«s  purpose  and  goals.  Considering  the  topic«s  interdisciplinary  nature, and  the  aim  to  identify  the  highest  possible  number  of  relevant  studies  [25],  we  selected 5  different  online  bibliographic  databases:  Sage,  Taylor  and  Francis,  Wiley,  AISeL,  and ACM  Digital  Library.  The  literature  search  was  conducted  on  November  4 th ,  2024.

The  search  string  was  built  by  combining  terms  related  to  the  concepts  of  i)  citizen participation,  ii)  ICT  and  iii)  inclusion.  These  terms  include  synonyms,  abbreviations, and  alternative  spellings  [25],  to  encompass  the  different  ways  the  concepts  are  referred to  by  researchers.  To  increase  relevancy  of  results,  the  search  for  each  term  group  was limited  to  the  Abstract  field.  The  query  was  tested  and  edited  several  times  before  the final  search,  to  ensure  that  the  best  applicable  keywords  were  selected,  and  the  highest number  of  relevant  articles  was  achieved.  The  search  string  used  was  the  following:

Abstract:  ('eparticipation'  OR  'participation'  OR  'citizen  engagement'  OR  'citizen  participation'  OR  'community  engagement'  OR  'civic  engagement'  OR  'citizen involvement')  AND  Abstract:  ('ICT'  OR  'information  and  communication  technology'  OR  'electronic'  OR  'online'  OR  'digital'  OR  'virtual')  AND  Abstract:  ('inclusion'  OR  'inclusive'  OR  'einclusion'  OR  'exclusion'  OR  'equity'  OR  'equality' OR  'inequality'  OR  'inclusiveness'  OR  'inclusivity'  OR  'exclusive').

Overall,  1494  articles  were  found,  and  uploaded  on  the  digital  systematic  review management  platform  Rayyan.

Selection. Firstly,  duplicate  articles  were  automatically  identified  using  Rayyan,  with 24  removed  after  manual  resolution.  The  remaining  1470  articles  underwent  a  two-phase screening:  1)  title  and  abstract screening  and  2)  full-text screening.  Criteria  for their inclusion,  applied  in  both  screening  stages,  were  defined  before  starting  the  process,  and the  reasons  justifying  the  decision  were  documented.  Studies  were  eligible  for  inclusion if  they  i)  were  in  English,  ii)  had  accessible  full-text,  iii)  clearly  focused  on  eParticipation initiatives  and  iv)  addressed  social  aspects  relevant  to  inclusion.  A  quality  check  was additionally  done  to  ensure  that  articles  were  peer-reviewed  and  of  sufficient  standard.

The  lead  author  screened  1470  articles,  with  a  second  reviewer  independently  assessing a sample  at the beginning  of the screening process, to minimize  bias. Results were compared  to  establish a  shared  understanding  of  relevance,  and  disagreements  were resolved  through  discussion.  After  title-and-abstract  screening,  the  number  of  articles was  narrowed  down  to  220.  These  were  taken  forward  for  full-text  review,  resulting  in 27  final  inclusions  (Fig.  1.).

Extraction  and  execution. Each  paper«s  general  characteristics  were  initially  mapped using  Excel.  This  was  followed  by  the  text  analysis,  using  a  thematic  approach  where codes were developed  in an inductive manner.  According  to Bandara  et al. [27], in this  approach  the  included  literature  is  treated  as  a  qualitative  data  set,  and  themes  are purely  derived  from  its  analysis.  We  utilized  open,  axial,  and  selective  coding  techniques [27],  which  were  carried  out  in  an  iterative  manner.  Each  article  was  first  read  in  full  to identify  the  relevant  text,  and  open  coding  was  performed  using  Zotero.  The  excerpts  and labels  were  then  imported  into  a  Microsoft  Word  document,  to  identify  the  relationships between  them,  and  develop  conceptual  links-a  process  known  as  axial  coding.  Selective coding  was  then  performed  to  organize  the  identified  dimensions  as  part  of  the  6  concepts for  inclusion  in  eParticipation,  described  in  the  findings  section  below.

## 4 Findings

Of  the  27  articles  included,  23  are  journal  papers  and  4  are  conference  proceedings.  19 of  the  articles  are  published  between  2020-2025,  7  between  2010-2019,  and  only  one  in 2008.  The  studies  report  from  a  variety  of  countries  including  USA,  Kenya,  South  Africa, Canada,  Australia,  New  Zealand,  Philippines,  but  mostly  European  countries-Estonia, Austria  and  Greece,  Germany,  UK,  Switzerland,  Netherlands,  Czechia,  Slovakia,  France, and  Finland.  The  articles  are  themed  into  6  conceptualizations  of  inclusion  for  eParticipation  with  19  dimensions.  The  concepts  are:  Access,  Knowledge,  Motivation,  Safety, Impact,  and  Empowerment.

## 4.1 Access

A  key  theme  throughout  the  articles  concerns  the  accessibility  of  eParticipation,  both in terms of i) the infrastructure necessary to be part of these processes, and ii) the accessibility  of  the  tool  or  format  selected.

Infrastructural. Having access to digital infrastructure is a prerequisite for being included in participatory activities. Digital infrastructure includes  device  ownership, internet service, and connectivity  infrastructure,  whose  availability  varies across different  demographics,  contexts,  and  geographic  regions.  While  adoption  of  ICT  tools intends  to  lower  the  access  threshold  by  overcoming  time  and  distance  limitations,  it  has also  introduced  a  new  layer  of  exclusion-unequal  technology  access  [28].  This  affects certain  social  groups  disproportionally,  reinforcing  existing  inequalities  [29].

Suitable  devices  are  essential  resources  for  eParticipation  [35].  However,  because  of socio-economic  reasons,  not  everyone  is  able  to  afford  modern  ICTs  [29,  30].  Availability of  smartphone  devices  can  additionally  be  a  concern  for  people  with  disabilities  [31,  32]. Depending  on  the  nature  of  their  limitations,  they  are  less  likely  to  use  mobile  devices  or engage  in  online  activities  [31].  Affording  digital  services  presents  another  obstacle  to inclusion.  Economically  disadvantaged  individuals  might  not  be  able  to  cover  the  costs of  mobile  data  and  broadband  plans  [30]  or  face  the  lack  of  connectivity  infrastructure, especially  for  people  who  live  in  rural  areas  [30,  34].  Many  remote  populations  face fundamental  infrastructure  deficits,  such  as  stable  electrical  power,  or  cellular  coverage, which  makes  inclusion  in  eParticipation  initiatives  impossible.

Addressing  these  structural barriers necessitates  interventions on multiple levels, including  infrastructural  investments,  process  strategies,  and  policy  measures  aimed  at improving  digital  access  [34-36].  These  strategies  must  account  for  economic  disparities, diverse  abilities,  and  geographic  inequalities  in  embedded  infrastructure.

Design-Related. Having  access  to  the  basic  infrastructure-devices,  the  internet,  and connectivity-is  only  the  first  step  towards  inclusive  eParticipation.  Equally  important is  the  accessibility  of  the  participatory  formats  themselves.  The  choice  of  technology facilitating  the  process  is  a  decisive  factor  in  who  can  access  the  activity.  Considering financial  disparities  across  different  demographics,  the  selected  tool  should  be  compatible  with  a  range  of  different  hardware  to  prevent  entry  barriers  [34].  Ensuring  the  equal usability  of  this  technology  among  different  devices  is  additionally  essential,  because not  everyone  owns  multiple  diverse  devices,  and  can  afford  switching  to  the  better  one [28].  Beyond  hardware  compatibility,  usability  is  a  key  determinant  of  access  [29,  32,  33, 37].  Functional,  intuitive  layouts  should  allow  all  users  to  access  information,  interact with  others,  and  give  their  input  with  ease.

A  crucial  consideration  in  tool  design  is  balancing  functionality  and  simplicity.  Highquality deliberation is important, but so is avoiding inequalities in the participation depth of different groups. The technological and functional characteristics of a tool influence  participation,  with  only  a  select  group - often  those  with  higher  educational backgrounds - able  to  navigate  overly  complex  designs  and  utilize  their  deliberative potential [35, 38]. Addressing  these obstacles requires well-designed platforms that combine  accessibility  with  meaningful  deliberation,  along  with  stronger  legal  pressures ensuring  the  technological  needs  and  preferences  of  diverse  demographics  are  met  [39].

## 4.2 Knowledge

Knowledge  is  the  next  theme  which  stems  from  differences  between  potential  participants'  skills  in  digital  literacy,  discursiveness,  language,  awareness,  or  domain-specific understanding.

Digital Literacy. Low  levels of digital literacy can hinder individuals from  participating,  despite  infrastructural  access  and  well-designed  tools.  Digital  literacy  includes multiple competencies,  such  as keyboard,  mobile, and touchscreen  skills, data literacy,  and  experience  or  familiarity  with  specific  ICT  tools  [30,  35].  This  literacy  is  not binary,  and  people  can  have  varying  levels  of  proficiency  across  the  different  aspects, which  impact  both  user  confidence  and  willingness  to  engage  [34,  40].  Limited  digital skills, often linked to lower educational  backgrounds  or  income  levels  [30, 41], reinforce  existing  divides  in  society.  To  enhance  inclusion,  assessing  users'  skill  levels and  providing  targeted  digital  literacy  training  is  essential  [30].  Longer-term  support and  capacity-building  interventions  are  also  crucial  [34],  as  one-time  training  may  not ensure  sustained  engagement  [34].

Discursiveness. Another  key  factor  impacting  people«s  ability  to  participate is their discursive  skills  [40].  This  refers  to  their  comfort  using  complex  discussion  languages, expressing  themselves  clearly,  understanding  others'  arguments,  and  collaborating  effectively.  Research  links  limitations  in  these  skills  to  lower  education  levels,  as  structured reasoning  and  formal  argumentation  require  significant  cognitive  effort  [38].  This  can result  in  exclusion  or  reduced  participation  from  meaningful  debates.

Domain-Specific  Understanding. A  lack  of  or  limited  knowledge  on  the  specific  issue under  deliberation  can  also  act  as  a  barrier  to  inclusive  engagement  [42,  43].  The  complexity  of  a  topic  influences  levels  of  participation  [43],  potentially  discouraging  certain  individuals  from  expressing  their  voice.  It  is  therefore  critical  to  provide  relevant preparatory  materials,  effective  communication  of  complex  information,  and  facilitated dialogue,  to  bridge  knowledge  gaps  and  support  equal  and  meaningful  engagement  for everyone  [42].

Language. Language  presents  another  significant  criterion  for  inclusive  participation. This can impact  migrant  communities,  who  may  not  be  proficient  in  the native  language.  If  they  have  difficulties  in  understanding  or  communicating  effectively,  meaningful  engagement  becomes  unfeasible  [28,  44].  However,  if  the  provided  information is  overly  technical  or  rigid,  it  can  be  difficult  to  understand  and  engage  with,  even  for native  speakers  [28,  32].  This  issue  can  impact  both  the  ability  to  participate  in  discussions,  but  also  the  learnability  of  digital  tools  and  interfaces.  Communication  should  be accessible  to  all,  through  support  mechanisms  such  as  translators,  cultural  mediators,  or multilingual  materials  [44,  45],  as  well  as  clear,  simple  terminology,  free  of  excessive technical  terms  [32].

Awareness. Lack  of  awarenesses  is  a  multifaceted  issue,  stemming  from  a  knowledge gap  about  participation  opportunities,  the  relevance  of  participation  in  daily  life,  or  individuals«  role  in  the  process  [28,  30].  This  can,  for  instance,  impact  immigrants,  who may  not feel included  by the term 'citizen' and assume  they«re  not part of the targeted  participants.  Awareness  gaps  also  include  capability  awareness,  where  individuals

- especially  those  with  low  digital  skills - do  not  see  the  value  of  digital  engagement formats  [28].  Some  forms  of  awareness  can  be  built  through  better  information  dissemination,  while  others  are  linked  to  deeply  rooted  social  issues  and  require  sustained  effort. Therefore,  awareness-building  should  be  a  central  concern,  especially  for  the  inclusion of  low-income  and  low-education  demographics  [30].

## 4.3 Motivation

Beyond  access  and  knowledge  barriers,  motivation  can  also  present  a  divide  for  inclusive eParticipation  processes.  This  can  be  of  political form,  but also linked  to the topic«s relevance,  time,  and  incentives.

Political. Political  motivation  is  shaped  by  political  activity  and  political  trust.  The  former  influences  an  individual«s  experience  and  interest  in  political  matters.  Engaging  in activities  like  political  meetings,  signing  petitions,  and  opinion  leadership  [33]  increases the  likelihood  of  participating  in  deliberative  processes.  High  interest  moreover  correlates  with  greater  internet  use  for  information  seeking,  protesting,  or  producing  political content  [41].  The  link  between  political  activity  and  participation  is  cyclical,  as  people who  are  more  interested  are  more  likely  to  engage.  This  experience,  in  turn,  boosts  political  efficacy  and  knowledge  and  therefore  further  involvement  [41,  46].  However,  these patterns  are  greatly  impacted  by  demographic  differences,  such  as  gender  [41],  age  [46], race  [47],  and  disability  status  [31].

Political  trust  plays  a  more  complex  role.  Low  trust  can  deter  participation,  if  individuals  believe  that  the  process  will  not  lead  to  a  meaningful  change - often  due  to  past failures  where  decisions  did  not  account  citizens«  input  [28].  On  other  cases,  mistrust  can serve  as  a  trigger  for  action  [40],  if  individuals  see  engagement  as  a  way  of  taking  matters into  their  own  hands.  This  can  be  explained  by  the  distinction  between  trust  in  'politics' (the  actors  within  the  political  system)  and  trust  in  the  'polity'  (the  functioning  of  the democratic  system  as  a  whole).  Those  who  trust  the  system  but  not  the  political  actors, act  as  'critical  citizens',  engaging  in  political  activities  to  push  for  change,  despite  their skepticism  [33].

Relevance  of  Topic. Participation  requires  emotional,  physical,  and  mental  investment, making  personal  relevance  of  the  issue  a  key  motivator  [42].  Individuals  factor  in  the potential  drawbacks  of  participating  before  deciding  if  getting  involved  is  worthwhile. This  particularly  impacts  marginalized  groups,  such  as  people  with  disabilities,  who face  greater  exposure  to  challenges  like  online  harassment  [39,  48].  However,  if  an  issue is highly  relevant,  people  are  likely to  engage  despite  potential  risks  [48].  To  ensure inclusive and meaningful  participation,  discussions  must  therefore resonate with the public  at  large  as  well  as  diverse  social  groups.

Temporal  Barriers. Although  ICT  use  aims  to  mitigate  time  constraints,  deliberative activities are tasks that must be balanced with social and economic  responsibilities [28].  Participation  is  often  viewed  as  a  leisure  activity  [28]  making  it  lower  priority  for those  juggling  (multiple)  jobs,  family,  or  personal  commitments.  The  cost  of  time  is particularly  significant  for  certain  social  groups,  like  the  economically  disadvantaged, who  must  prioritize  income-generating  opportunities  [30].  When  gendered  social  norms

intersect  with  economic  and  rural  factors,  these  barriers  become  manifold.  Programs must  therefore  understand  these  dynamics  at  play  and  strive  to  cater  to  the  diverse  needs and  constraints  of  diverse  groups.

Incentives. Another key factor for inclusion is incentives. Gift cards or monetary rewards  can  motivate  those  who  may  otherwise  need  to  prioritize  responsibilities  like work  or  economic  concerns  over  engagement  [28,  41].  Recognition  or  compensation  also helps  make  certain  groups,  such  as  historically  exploited  marginalized  communities,  feel that  their  time  and  effort  are  genuinely  valued  [28].

## 4.4 Safety

Safety  is  a  critical  criterion  for  all  different  social  groups  to  feel  welcome  and  comfortable in  engaging  in  electronic  participation.

Privacy  and  Security  Needs. Individuals  need  to  feel  that  their  privacy  is  respected  and that  participating  does  not  negatively  expose  them  [44].  These  concerns  are  amplified  in digital  spaces,  where  the  risks  of  data  leaks  or  hacking  are  more  pronounced  [32].  Beyond external  security  threats,  the  risk  of  being  identified  and  targeted  can  be  a  significant challenge.  If  recognizable  identifiers  are  not  protected,  citizens  are  at  a  risk  of  facing retaliation when  reporting unethical practices or negative feedback  [32].  Vulnerable social  groups,  such  as  people  with  disabilities  [39],  or  asylum-seekers  [44]  are  also  likely to  face  higher  scrutiny  or  discrimination  if  identified.  If  they  are  forced  to  choose  selfprotection  over  engagement  [48],  the  process  can  no  longer  be  considered  inclusive,  as their  voices  will  not  be  represented.  It  is  critical  that  ICT  design  ensure  trust  and  integrity, giving  assurance  that  participants«  information  is  securely  stored  and  safeguarded  [44]. Data  protection  policies  should  be  easily  attainable,  for  everyone  to  be  well  informed of how  their data is handled  [32]. Privacy through  design, such as filter bubbles, or anonymity  control  features  [39,  49],  ensures  the  burden  of  managing  their  security  does not fall solely on individuals  [48]. This can minimize  the  potential  risks of political involvement  and  empower  people  to  engage  without  fear  [48,  50].

Power  Dynamics. Safety is additionally determined by the interactions and  power dynamics  among  different socio-demographic  groups, which can manifest in disrespectful  exchanges  or  discriminatory  language.  Individuals  from  marginalized  backgrounds  are  more  likely  to  experience  harassment  or  personal  attacks,  making  them  feel unwelcome  or  unsafe  in  deliberative  spaces  [39,  44].  These  fears  are  common  among racial  minorities,  who  may  be  exposed  to  discrimination  and  unfair  treatment  in  engagement  activities,  both  on  and  offline  [49].  Exclusionary  communication  can  also  stem from  social  stereotyping  and  elitism  based  on  ethnic,  class,  or  lifestyle  differences  [50]. Power  imbalances  may  not  always  be  overtly  aggressive,  but  still  determine  whose  voices dominate  discussions  and  whose  are  silenced  -  often  evident  in  gender  differences  [42]. Active  efforts  are  necessary  to  ensure  safe  and  respectful  interactions,  where  everyone feels  comfortable  and  open  to  voicing  their  opinions.  The  design  of  the  process  plays a  critical  role  in  ensuring  everyone  can  actively  engage,  rather  than  allowing  a  few  to dominate  the  conversation  [51].  Moderators  should  moreover  follow  established  rules which  help  facilitate  equal  discussions,  free  from  bias  [42,  43].

## 4.5 Impact

For  eParticipation  to  be  deemed  inclusive,  satisfaction  with  the  outcome  plays  a  key role.  This  concerns  two  factors,  responsiveness  of  the  organizers  of  the  process,  and transparency  and  fairness  of  how  decision-making  is  carried  out.

Responsiveness  of  Organizers. Citizens  need  to  see  that  the  input  they  contribute  with is  considered  and  acted  upon,  in  order  to  perceive  their  engagement  as  meaningful  [32]. This  is  an  impactful  factor  when  calculating  whether  to  engage  or  not,  especially  for the  less  advantaged  groups  [30].  A  responsive  solution  is  keeping  participants  updated after  each  stage  with  information  and  a  timeline  about  the  upcoming  steps  [45].  Another way  to  support  these  expectations  is  to  disseminate  information  about  successful  and impactful  previous  discussions  [42].  It  is  moreover  critical  for  the  official  to  be  present in  discussions,  to  ensure  that  all  targeted  groups  have  confidence  in  the  chance  for  real impact.

Transparency  and  Fairness  in  Decision-Making. To  ensure  the  inclusiveness  of  eParticipation  processes,  decision-making  should  moreover  strive  to  be  as  fair  as  possible, in  terms  of  how  different  interests  are  represented  [40].  It  is  critical  for  individuals  to believe  that  their  participation  is  fair  and  meaningful,  and  they  should  be  able  to  see  the fruits  of  their  engagement  in  the  final  deliberation  product  [52].  However,  processing and  analyzing  input  generated  during  deliberation  is  a  demanding  task,  and  the  factors that  determine  which  interests  will  be  better  served  are  manifold.  To  ensure  that  the  final decision  is taken  in a fair manner,  transparency  of  how  input  is  evaluated  is  critical. People  should  be  able  to  see  how  their  position  compares  to  the  overall  result,  and  how arguments  influenced  the  outcome  [52].  Digital  tools  can  support  this  by  making  everyone«s  contributions  and  the  decision  criteria  visible  [37].  Such  mechanisms  should  be  a legal  requirement,  to  enhance  transparency  and  accountability  of  organizing  actors,  and promote  the  fair  evaluation  of  different  interests,  even  if  not  all  are  reflected  in  the  final decision  [32].

## 4.6 Empowerment

Individuals must  feel that they are capable, supported, and recognized  as legitimate political  actors,  to  feel  empowered  to  participate.  This  empowerment  can  be  impacted and shaped  by self-belief, social networks,  cultural-specific  approaches,  and  agency development.

Self-belief. People  may  experience  a  lack  of  confidence  as  a  significant  barrier  to  inclusion.  Even  if  other  criteria  for  inclusion  in  eParticipation  are  met,  individuals  may  feel uncomfortable  or  hesitant  to  express  their  views  and  share  their  perspectives  with  others [28].  This  often  stems  from  negative  self-perception,  shaped  by  power  imbalances  [28] and  an  internalized  sense  of  one«s  'place  in  social  hierarchies'  [30].  Such  barriers  are particularly  problematic  for  vulnerable  groups,  like  the  younger  generation,  who  may feel  that  issues  concerning  them  are  often  discussed  without  their  input,  or  that  their engagement  would  make  little  difference  [29].  This  exclusion  reinforces  a  cycle  of  disempowerment.  Similarly,  economically  disadvantaged  individuals  often  experience  low

self-esteem  tied  to  a  sense  of  powerlessness  as  years  of  exclusion  can  create  a  'culture of  silence',  where  individuals  no  longer  see  the  value  of  their  opinions  [30].  When  people  internalize  the  belief  that  their  voices  do  not  matter,  disengagement  is  not  simply a  personal  choice,  but  a  reflection  of  the  structural  inequalities  and  deep-rooted  power hierarchies.

Social  Network. Another  aspect  which  determines  empowerment  is  the  social  capital an  individual  possesses.  Social  networks-including  schools,  marketplaces,  churches, community  centers,  family,  and  friends-form  the  immediate  structures  that  shape  daily interactions  and  provide  essential  support  [35].  A  strong  social  network  has  a  positive effect  on  individuals'  attitudes,  skills,  and  confidence,  empowering  them  to  participate both  online  and  offline  [35,  36].  An  existing  network  lowers  the  threshold  for  engagement  in  eParticipation,  by  fostering  a  sense  of  belonging,  facilitating  opinion-sharing, and  providing  reinforcement  for  individuals'  views.  Without  pre-existing  connections, participation  becomes  more  difficult,  as  individuals  must  put  forth  active  efforts  to  foster a  sense  of  community  on  these  platforms  [49].  Engaging  alone  additionally  comes  with a greater risk of speaking  up  on  an  issue as  an  individual,  whereas  collective  action mitigates  this  [49].

Cultural  Needs. Inclusion  cannot  be  a  one-size-fits-all  approach.  Cultural  specificities significantly  shape  how,  and  to  what  extent,  individuals  can  engage  in  eParticipation. These  influences  manifest  in  various  forms.  For  example,  Bickerton  and  Löfgren  [48] show  that  political  engagement  within  New  Zealand«s  social  networks  is  often  perceived negatively, discouraging  individuals from openly expressing their views. To prevent cultural  norms  from  becoming  barriers  to  participation,  it  is  critical  to  recognize  these dynamics  and  actively  mitigate  their  negative  impacts.  Culturally  sensitive  approaches should  be  integrated  to  create  engagement  opportunities  that  are  meaningful  and  relevant to  diverse  demographics  and  their  values  [49],  for  instance  migrant  communities,  who may  struggle  to  navigate  new  social  and  legal  contexts  [44].  A  key  challenge  lies  in  the tendency  to  treat  minority  communities  as  a  homogenous  entity,  overlooking  internal differences.  Many  individuals  do  not  fit  within  one  community,  as  their  sense  of  identity is  created  by  an  interplay  of  cultural,  racial,  religious,  national,  and  social  affiliations [49].  Cultural  distances  should  therefore  be  acknowledged,  and  strategies  should  adopt flexible,  rather  than  standardized  approaches,  to  accommodate  diverse  sensitivities  and needs  [44].

Agency. Inclusion  efforts  require  a  shift  in  how  marginalized  individuals  are  perceived and  integrated  into  eParticipation  [39].  People  with  disabilities,  for  instance,  are  often categorized  as  vulnerable  and  in  need  of  protection,  which  reinforces  a  protective  rather than  empowering  approach.  It  is  critical  to  move  beyond  this  passive  medical  model and  mainstream  inclusivity  by  fostering  agency  in  participants  [39].  Instead  of  creating separate  digital  spaces  custom  to  specific  needs,  which  can  lead  to  isolation,  marginalized users  should  be  involved  in  co-designing  the  participatory  tools  and  programs.  Their perspectives  can  help  shape  digital  spaces  that  are  functional  for  all,  thereby  creating autonomous  digital  citizens  and  legitimate  political  actors,  rather  than  passive  recipients of  support  [39].

Fig.  2. Conceptual  Framework  for  Inclusive  eParticipation

In  this  SLR,  we  asked 'How  can  inclusive  eParticipation  be  conceptualized?'. Visualized  in  Fig.  2,  we  demonstrate  how  inclusion  can  be  understood  through  19  key  dimensions  for  inclusive  eParticipation,  within  the  6  core  concepts  of  accessibility,  knowledge, motivation,  safety,  impact,  and  empowerment.  In  the  below,  we  relate  the  framework to  existing  eParticipation  literature  and  illuminate  its  core  implications  for  research  and practice  on  eParticipation.

First  of  all,  determinants  of  eParticipation  in  our  framework  display  an  intersectional character,  meaning  that  different  forms  of  power  structures  and  demographic  variables overlap  in  determining  people's  position.  As  theorized  by  Crenshaw  [53],  intersectionality  involves  the  coincidence  of  different  structures  in  shaping  the  position  of  the  individual:  for  instance,  gender,  ethnicity  and  economic  position  concur  to  shape  a  person's strength  or vulnerability  in  a  given  setting.  The  same  is  observed  in  our  framework, where  concepts  of  accessibility,  knowledge  and  impact  divides  concur,  among  others, to  shape  an  individual's  position.  Recent  works  in  the  IS's  space,  e.g.  [54,  55],  highlight the  importance  of  an  intersectional  lens,  and  illuminate  its  role  as  a  guiding  device  in eGovernance  research.

Secondly,  our  conceptual  framework  identifies  accessibility,  knowledge,  motivation, safety,  impact,  and  empowerment  as  the  shape  for  inclusiveness  in  eParticipation.  This means  that  the  identified  concepts  act  jointly  in  shaping  eParticipation,  and  are  predicated on  each  other  in  such  a  way  that  one  will  affect  the  other  [56].  This  view  of  inclusive eParticipation  problematizes  mono-dimensional  approaches  often  seen  in  the  included corpus  of  literature,  which  mainly  focuses  on  isolated  factors  such  as  technical  or  designrelated  ones.  Our  framework  challenges  this  issue  and  invites  instead  holistic  approaches,

such  as  sociologies  of  governance  [57],  that  capture  the  mutual  and  dynamic  relation among  dimensions.  Developing  this  framework,  we  have  noted  that  a  holistic  approach can make  explanatory sense of eParticipation and be a basis for future  expounding efforts  [58].  Further  research  should  focus  on  empirically  validating  this  framework  and exploring  potential  missing  dimensions  and  the  interplay  among  them.  This  includes examining  perspectives  from  both  citizens  and  experts  involved  in  the  process-an  angle often  overlooked  in  the  reviewed  articles,  which  tend  to  prioritize  one  over  the  other.

Finally,  we  submit  that  our  conceptual  framework  can  help  adjust  the  ways  in  which strategies  and  efforts  for  inclusive  practices  can  be  focused.  Building  inclusion  means engaging  an  effort  of  stakeholder  harmonization,  which  the  6  mutual  concepts  identified in  our  framework  can  support.  The  different  dimensions  are  relevant  to  the  construction of  inclusive  practices.  For  example,  impact  divides  have  been  dealt  with  in  recent  ICT for  Development  (ICT4D)  research,  in  the  light  of  their  incidence  on  data  justice  and  its achievement  [54].  At  a  time  of  high  practical  relevance  of  eParticipation,  it  is  important that  a  holistic  approach  is  taken  to  it,  exploring  how  different  dimensions  affect  its  uptake among  people.

A  key  limitation  of  this  review  is  the  potential  for  selection  bias  due  to  language and  database  restrictions,  which  may  have  excluded  some  relevant  articles.  Expanding the  study  to  other  databases  and  languages  could  be  an  interesting  avenue  for  future research,  reducing  this  bias.

## 6 Conclusion

Through  a  systematic  literature  review,  we  identified  the  multidimensional  nature  of inclusive  eParticipation,  shaped  by  the  core  concepts  of  access,  knowledge,  motivation, safety,  impact,  and  empowerment.  We  offer  a  conceptual  framework  with  a  holistic  lens, using these  conceptualizations  and  the  19  dimensions.  This  framework  can  serve  as a  valuable  basis  for  practitioners  and  policymakers  to  evaluate  initiatives  and  understand where  efforts should focus to improve  inclusiveness  of engagement  activities. Ultimately,  advancing  inclusive  approaches  remains  essential  for  eParticipation  to  fulfill its  democratizing  potential.

Abstract. There  is  limited  research  that  presents  both  technical  and  non-technical factors  that  influence  e-participation.  The  aim  of  the  paper  is  to  identify  technical and  non-technical  factors  that influence  e-participation  design  and  use  in rural Uganda.  This  was  achieved  by  drawing  on  Isingiro  District's  citizens  and  government  leaders'  experiences  and  socio-technical  context  data  through  43  in-depth interviews.  The  study  shows  that  a  wide  range  of  individual  factors,  institutional and  socio-cultural  practices  hinder  uptake  of  usage  of  ICTs  in  political  participation  and  some  enabling  factors.  Our  study  lays  the  foundation  for  researchers, governments,  policymakers,  and  e-participation  designers  to  identify  necessary conditions  for  designing  effective  e-participation  models  and  systems  in  settings similar  to  rural  western  Uganda.

## 1 Introduction

Citizen  participation  in  deliberative  democratic  processes  is  one  of  the  significant  topics in  government  administration,  particularly  as  the  demand  for  Information  Communication  Technologies  (ICTs)  to  enhance  citizen  engagement  increases  [7]  and  its  global adoption  expands  [19].  ICTs  refer  to  the  use  of  digital  technologies  like  radio,  television, computers,  internet,  mobile  devices,  and  personal  computer  kiosks  to  produce,  capture, process,  store,  send,  receive,  access  and  manipulate  information  [9].  The  use  of  ICTs  to facilitate  interactions  between  government  and  citizens  to  achieve  inclusive  deliberative and  participatory  decision-making  processes  is  referred  to  as  electronic  participation (e-participation)  [32].  The  demand  to  use  e-participation  is  driven  by  the  ability  of  the technologies  to  enable  governments  to  engage  a  wider  audience  of  citizens  more  efficiently  and  conveniently  while  promoting  transparency  and  accountability  [11].  Some other  advantages  and  benefits  of  e-participation  consist  of  optimizing  governance,  promoting  transparency,  improving  public  services,  and  empowering  citizens  compared  to traditional  participation  channels  [35,  36].  Additionally,  e-participation  has  perceived advantages  of  reducing  time  and  costs,  driving  economic  growth,  and  enhancing  political  freedoms  [37,  38].  Despite  the  spread  and  perceived  advantages  of  e-participation, the  progress  of  its  use  remains  limited  particularly  in  developing  countries  [25,  39].

Research  shows  that  to  address  the  limitation  and  increase  the  uptake  and  use  of  eparticipation,  the  factors  that  influence  e-participation  based  on  perspectives  of  diverse stakeholders (e.g., public institutions culture and citizens motivation), socio-cultural contexts  and  ICTs  ecosystems  need  to  be  understood  [21,  23,  39].  Understanding  these factors  is  crucial  to  guide  design  and  implementation  of  e-participation  solutions  and interventions  that  reflect  the  users'  needs  and  contexts.  Some  studies  have  begun  making progress  in  identifying  the  factors  that  influence  e-participation  [2,  3,  19,  24].  However, most  of  these  studies  have  focused  predominantly  on  the  technical  factors  while  ignoring the  non-technical  factors  associated  with  the  user  contexts  [52].  The  establishment  of the  technical  factors  alone  is  arguably  insufficient  to  address  the  issue  of  e-participation uptake  and  usage,  as  it  presents  only  one  of  the  many  contributing  factors  needed  to address  the  problem  holistically  [21].

Technical  factors  are  affected  by  both  internal and  external  factors that  influence stakeholders  to  take  part  in  e-participation  interventions  [15]  and  determine  how  the systems  are  used  [52].  In  the  design  of  e-participation  systems  and  interventions,  both technical  and  non-technical  factors  need  to  be  considered  [12,  21,  39].  For  example, Gibreel  and  Hong  [12]  recommends  identifying  factors  that  influence  e-participation based  on  social, technical, and  cultural aspects  to attain holistic solutions.  Similarly, Nilsson  and  Barbuitu  [20]  recommend  the  identification  of  technology,  social  and  political factors when  identifying  factors that influence e-participation use in  developing countries.  Our  study  contributes  by  identifying  and  discussing  socio-technical  factors that  influence  e-participation  design  and  use  in  a  developing  country  context,  with  a specific focus on Uganda.  Therefore,  the  guiding  research  question  for  this paper is 'What  are  the  perspectives  of  local  government  leaders  and  citizens  on  socio-technical contextual  factors  that  influence  the  use  of  e-participation  in  rural  Uganda?'.

The  focus  of  our  study  in  rural  Uganda  is  motivated  by  the  limited  research  on  eparticipation  in  rural  areas  [28]  especially  in  developing  countries  [19].  To  our  knowledge only  one  study  has  explored  factors  that  influence  e-participation  in  rural  Uganda,  focusing  primarily  on  citizens  perspectives  [20].  The  authors  recommend  the  consideration  of local  government  leaders'  perspectives  in  future  research.  While  our  research  addresses this recommendation,  it  takes a  comprehensive  approach  to  identify  and  understand the  socio-technical  factors  that  both  inhibit  and  facilitate  the  use  of  e-participation  in rural  Uganda.  It  focuses  on  two  parishes  in  Isingiro  district  Uganda  where  the  technical and  non-technical  perspectives  including  rural  citizens  and  local  government  leaders' experiences,  socio-cultural  and  institutional  practices  are  captured  through  an  in-depth interview  to  determine  these  factors.  In  all,  while  the  paper  contributes  to  the  gap  in  literature,  it  provides  valuable  insights  into  the  socio-technical  factors  needed  to  successfully leverage  e-participation  systems  in  rural  settings  in  Africa.

The  rest  of  the  paper  is  put  together  as  follows.  Section  2  presents  the  related  work followed  by  the  research  methodology  in  Sect.  3  and  results  in  Sect.  4.  The  last  two sections  discuss  the  research  results  in  Sect.  4  and  conclusion  and  future  work  in  Sect.  6.

## 2.1 Political  Participation  and  ICTs

Political  participation  is  defined  as  the  process  through  which  the  powerless  exercise  their rights  to  influence  policy  and  other  decisions  that  result  in  significant  transformations and  benefits  to  them  [6].  In  this  paper,  political  participation  is  defined  as  the  interaction  between  citizens  and  the  government,  enabling  citizens  to  exercise  their  rights  and contribute  to  policy  formation  and  decision-making  processes  that  drive  societal  transformation  [40].  Traditional  political  participation  processes  are  generally  restricted  to physical  locations  and  time,  but  the  use  ICTs  in  political  participation  (e-participation) has  enabled  participation  to  take  place  anywhere  and  anytime  in  a  faster  manner  [4,  22]. E-participation  also  enable  anonymity,  allowing  individuals  to  participate  in  political discourses  without  the  fear  of  intimidation  or  concerns  about  privacy  [30].  Essentially citizens  can  use  ICTs  to  interact  with  political  leaders,  submit  their  opinions,  vote  for  an opinion  and  take  part  in  deliberative  discussions  without  fear  and  restrictions  compared  to physical  political  participation  [8,  34,  41].  This  implies  that  ICTs  can  enable  policymakers  to  directly  gather  citizens'  opinions  to  facilitate  decision  making  [16],  and  achieve what  was  previously  difficult  to  accomplish  through  traditional  public  participation  [26].

E-participation  has  divergent  definitions.  For  example  [54]  defines  e-participation as  the  use  of  the  use  of  internet  to  support  democratic  and  consultative  processes.  This definition  restricts  e-participation  to  only  utilise  internet  as  a  channel  which  may  not  be true  in  cases  where  other  channels  are  used.  Consequently,  [55]  considers  e-participation as the use of different forms of ICTs (not just internet) to enable interact  between government  citizens.  Another  definition  is provided  by  [32] where  e-participation  is defined  as  'the  process  of  engaging  citizens  through  ICTs  in  policy,  decision-making, and  service  design  and  delivery  so  as  to  make  it  participatory,  inclusive  and  deliberative'. This  definition  is  including  of  other  forms  of  ICTs  and  allows  citizens  and  government to  engage.  This  research  considers  the  latter  definition.

Governments  in  developed  and  developing  countries  are  using  different  forms  of ICTs  to  facilitate  interactions  between  government  leaders  and  citizens.  For  example,  the former  president  Obama  administration  strategically  used  social  media  to  inform  citizens and  collect  feedback  to  draft  policies  that  meet  citizens  expectations  [29].  In  Uganda,  the presidential  candidate  President  Museveni  used  pre-recorded  voice  messages  to  inform citizens  of  his  manifesto,  request  for  votes  and  thank  them  for  their  support  upon  victory [14].  In  both  instances,  the  politicians  aimed  at  the  most  efficient  and  sustainable  way to  communicate  while  empowering  the  citizens  by  involving  them  in  decision-making processes.  Yet,  even  with  these  examples,  recent  research  highlights  that  there  is  still limited  use of  e-participation  [28].  This  has led  researchers  to  advocate  for  the  need to  focus  on  identifying  factors  that  influence  the  uptake  of  e-participation  to  guide  the design  and  implementation  of  e-participation  systems  that  reflect  the  needs  and  contexts of  the  wider  population  [21,  23,  39].

## 2.2 Factors  that  Influence  E-participation

As stated earlier, e-participation provides  a new  transformative  space  for citizens to engage  actively  in  deliberative  democratic  processes,  extending  traditional  citizen  participation.  However,  the  effectiveness  of  e-participation  depends  on  a  combination  of technical and non-technical factors embodied  in the context in which  the system  is deployed.  The  technical  factors  involve  the  technical  infrastructure  and  digital  tools  that facilitate e-participation [21, 42] while the non-technical  factors relate to the social, institutional  and  political  elements  that  shape  the  uptake  and  use  of  e-participation  [21, 43].

In  general,  significant  research  exist  on  the  technical  factors  that  influence  the  use of  e-participation  [21,  44-46].  Most  existing  research  primarily  focuses  on  countries outside  of  Africa.  For  instance,  [52]  employ  questionnaire  surveys  in  China  to  determine non-technical  factors  that  focus  on  psychological  aspects.  The  results  showed  that  the factors  that  influence  citizens  to  use  e-participation  are  high  internal  and  external  political efficacy along  with citizens' high literacy levels and trust in government's  ability  to provide  feedback.  In  another  study,  [51]  explore  non-technical  factors  that  influence  eparticipation  in  education  settings  in  the  developed  world.  The  factors  include  language proficiency  (e.g.,  mastery  of  English  language  and  language  translation  tools)  and  trust  in e-participation  tools  for  protecting  the  privacy  of  users.  Both  studies  highlight  the  critical role  of  non-technical  social,  political  and  cultural  factors  when  developing  e-participation interventions.

While  establishing  non-technical  factors  has  emerged  as  essential elements  to  eparticipation, some scholars have argued that focusing on either technical or  nontechnical  factors  is  insufficient  as  it  does  not  provide  a  holistic  approach  to  the  identification  of  factors  that  influence  e-participation  [12,  52].  To  this  end,  [12]  advise  that  the social,  technical  and  socio-technical  aspects  should  be  considered  when  identifying  factors  that  influence  e-participation.  In  their  study,  [12]  use  dataset  from  the  World  Bank, United  Nations  and  International  Telecommunication  Union  to  identify  social,  technical and  socio-technical  factors  that  influence  e-participation.  The  authors  show  that  social factors  such  as  high  levels  of  education  and  literacy  increase  e-participation  adoption and  the  technical  factors  including  the  internet  and  telecommunication  infrastructure availability  positively  influence  e-participation.  They  also  demonstrate  the  usefulness of  the  socio-technical  elements  for  effective  use  of  e-participation  such  as  electricity availability,  income  level,  affordable  broadband  subscription  and  access  to  landlines  and internet  enabled  mobile  phones.

Similarly,  [5]  used  questionnaire  surveys  to  identify  both  technical,  social  and  political factors that influence e-participation in Kuwait. The authors used a  technology acceptance  model  to  determine  factors  that  influence  Kuwait  citizens'  intention  to  use e-participation. The  factors include availability of infrastructure, the use of citizens' preferred  means  of  communication,  the  use  of  clear  and  simple  website  designs  and content,  social  influence,  political  factors  (include  having  trust  in  government,  government's  commitment,  and  citizens  involvement  in  political  parties'  activities),  perceived usefulness  and  perceived  ease  of  use.

## 2.3 E-participation  Inhibiting  Factors

Along  with  the  facilitating  factors  of  e-participation,  studies  have  also  explored  the  barriers  that  hinder  the  adoption  and  use  of  the  system  [10,  28,  41].  For  example,  [10]  identify technical  challenges  involved  in  the  registration  and  downloading  of  information  as  major problems  for  effective  use  of  e-participation  in  Finland.  [28]  report  socio-technical  and infrastructure  barriers  that  limit  e-participation  adoption  in  Germany.  This  includes  limited  ICT  skills,  inadequate  internet  infrastructure,  citizens'  lack  of  experience  with  digital  political  participation  and  inflexible  structures  that  affect  implementation  of  citizens' feedback.

In  Iran,  [25]  look  beyond  technical  factors  to  explore  the  barriers  related  to  leaders  and  citizens'  perspectives  of  e-participation.  They  identify  barriers  such  as  limited public  participation  structures,  problems  with  trust  and  confidence,  limited  knowledge and  awareness  of  e-participation,  lack  of  citizens'  interest,  citizens  and  leaders  conflicting  interests,  limited  infrastructure,  challenges  with  leadership  and  high  costs  involved. The  limitations  in  existing  structures  included  leaders'  poor  attitudes  towards  public participation  and  the  lack  of  open-minded  attitude  in  the  usage  of  information  communication  technologies.  The  trust  and  confidence  factors  include  the  lack  of  citizens and  leaders'  trust  in  e-participation  to  achieve  expected  outcomes  and  the  belief  that e-participation  widen  the  digital  divide  and  does  not  provide  privacy.  The  problem  with interest  includes  leaders'  unwillingness  to  be  transparent  and  to  provide  feedback,  and citizens  and  leaders'  conflicting  interests.

In all, the majority  of the studies on the inhibiting  factors of  e-participation  also primarily  focus  on  non-developing  African  contexts.  To  our  knowledge  a  few  studies have explored the barriers to e-participation adoption in Africa [17, 20, 42, 48]. In Nigeria,  [56]  uses  a  survey  to  establish  that  bureaucratic  government  processes,  limited infrastructure,  limited  funding,  resistance  to  change,  cultural  barriers  and  limited  digital skills  are  factors  that  inhibit  e-participation.  While  in  South  Africa,  [17]  highlights  lack of  awareness  of  e-participation  systems,  costly  mobile  data,  limited  digital  skills  and resistance  to  change  as  the  factors  that  hinder  e-participation.  In  Uganda,  [20]  research identifies  social,  technical,  political,  economic,  cultural  and  organisational  aspects  that hinder  e-participation  use  in  the  rural  areas.  This  includes  citizens'  inability  to  afford broadband  and  internet  enabled  devices,  language  barriers,  illiteracy,  limited  ICT  skills, limited  infrastructure,  gender  inequalities,  leaders'  inability  to  give  feedback  and  citizens lack  of  awareness  of  their  right  to  take  part  in  civic  engagement.  However,  the  research lacks  the  enabling  factors  and  focuses  only  on  the  citizens'  perspective,  which  limits holistic  understanding  of  the  factors  that  influence  effective  use  of  e-participation.  The question remains; What  are the leaders and citizens perspectives on socio-technical contextual  factors  that  influence  e-participation  in  Rural  Uganda?

## 3 Methodology

## 3.1 A  Subsection  Sample

The research employed a qualitative research approach involving in-depth semistructured interviews  to  explore the social-technical contexts  and  participants'  experience  of  e-participation  in  rural  Uganda.  Semi-structured  interviews  offered  an  appropriate method  to engage with the participants in their natural environments  to  capture detailed data useful for understanding  the  contexts  and  factors that  influence  eparticipation  [18,  27,  33].  Physical  face-to-face  interviews  were  conducted  in  February and  March  2023  to  identify  socio-technical  factors  that  could  hinder  or  support  usage of ICTs  in political  participation.  The  interview  questions  may  be  summarised  into: 'What  factors  may  hinder/support  you  from  using  ICTs  in  decision-making  processes? What  are  the  positive/  negative  things  in  your  surrounding  that  may  support/hinder  you from  participating  in  decision  making  meetings  through  use  of  ICTs?'.  On  average, each  interview  lasted  45min.  A  total  of  43  participants  from  two  parishes  in  Isingiro district  -  Kajaho  and  Kamubeize  -  were  interviewed.  34  of  the  participants  were  rural citizens  while  9  were  local  government  leaders  (village-subcounty).  The  majority  of the  interviews  were  conducted  in  the  participants'  native  Runyankole  language  because most  of  the  participants  would  not  understand  or  speak  English.  The  audio  recording was  transcribed  and  translated  into  English  for  analysis.

The  participants  from  the  leader  and  citizen  categories  were  purposively  selected using  the  following  criteria:  gender  (male- and  female),  marital  status  (unmarried  and married),  Age  Groups  (18-27,  28-37,  38-47,  48-57,  58-67),  economic  status  (lowincome  earners  and  medium  income  earners)  and  level  of  education.  For  example,  age groups  18-27,  28-37,  38-47,  48-57  and  58-67  was  represented  by  5,  12,  17,  6,  and 3  participants  respectively  while  males  were  23  and  females  were  20.  The  uneducated, primary  level,  lower  secondary,  higher  secondary,  college  certificate,  Diploma  and  bachelor's  degree  levels  of  education  was  represented  by  4,  27,  5,  2,  1,  2,  and  2  participants respectively.  This  ensured  that  different  categories  of  participants  are  recruited  to  obtain diverse  perspectives.  Snowball  was  used  to  complement  the  selection  method.  The  starting  point  was  the  researchers  collaborating  with  the  Local  Council  1  (LC1)  leaders  and the  leaders  of  the  community  social  groups  in  Kajaho  and  Kamubeizi  parishes  to  identify the  participants  of  the  desired  categories.  Once  the  participants  were  recruited,  they  were asked  to  recommend  other  participants  with  similar  characteristics.

We  provided  all  participants  with  the  participant  information  sheet  and  informed  consent  forms  to  ensure  voluntary  participation.  Research  ethical  approvals  were  obtained from  Brunel  University  London-36322-MHR-Jan/2023-430440-3,  Mbarara  University of Science and Technology-MUST-2022-712  and  the Uganda National Council of Science  and  Technology-SS1621ES.

The  data  scripts  were  translated  from  Runyankole  to  English  for  analysis.  The  data was  anonymised  and  analysed.  Analysis  followed  [49]  thematic  analytical  approach where  we  inductively  generated  codes,  identified  patterns,  and  analysed  themes  within the data. During  the analysis stage, 23 codes were  generated  and  grouped  into four themes.  The  first  theme  (Individual hindering  factors) was  derived from  the  following codes:  limited  ICT  Skills, illiteracy,  poverty,  mistrust  of  technology  and  leaders,

lack  of  citizens'  confidence  and  citizens  lack  of  interest.  The  second  theme  (Limited infrastructure)  was  emerged  from  the  following  codes:  limited  telecommunication  network,  limited  internet  access,  limited  electricity  and  limited  access  to  devices.  The  third theme;  Society  and  leaders  hindering  culture  merged  from  the  following  codes:  hindering  cultural  beliefs,  gender-based  discrimination,  leaders'  non-inclusiveness  and  leaders not  implementing  meeting  outcomes.  Lastly,  the  enabling  factors  theme  emerged  from these  codes;  existence  of  local  government  structures,  infrastructure  availability,  awareness  of  benefits  of  using  ICTs  and  belief  in  illiterate  making  contributions.  The  details are  presented  in  the  results  section  below.

## 4 Results

The  focus  of the research  is to identify socio-technical  factors  that inhibit or  enable e-participation  in  rural  Uganda.  The  factors  are  presented  in  detailed  under  four  themes including  individual  factors,  technology  infrastructure,  society  and  leadership  culture and  supporting  factors.

## 4.1 Individual  Factors

Analysis  of the data shows  that several factors that hinder the use of e-participation arise  at  the  individual  level.  The  factors  identified  include  illiteracy,  limited  ICT  skills, poverty,  mistrust  of  technology  and  leaders,  citizens'  lack  of  interest  and  confidence.  The participants  highlight  that  the  majority  of  the  rural  population  are  either  illiterate  or  have low  level  of  education,  mostly  at  the  primary  level  education.  As  a  result,  the  majority cannot  read  and  understand  the  language  of  the  interface  of  the  devices  used,  messages sent  to  their  phones  or  any  information  on  e-participation  systems  in  English. 'Their education levels are low and in most cases the technologies used are in English language and require a translator' P22 . ' Illiteracy is a problem with most villagers, if you send a message on phone but out of 10 people only 2 can read it '  P08.  These  quotes  reaffirm the  challenges  associated  with  illiteracy.

Along  with  the  problem  of  illiteracy,  some  participants  express  concerns  about  citizens'  limited  skills  to  operate  mobile  phones  or  social  media.  Such  digital  illiteracy is reported to limit their usage of phones  and  other ICTs  used to facilitate political participation  in  the  rural  areas.  Further  analysis  of  the  data  demonstrates  a  clear  link between  illiteracy and citizens' limited ICT  skills, as both reinforce each  other.  The limited  knowledge  of  English  results  in  the  difficulty  of  affected  participants  to  interact with  the  ICTs  used  to  facilitate  e-participation.  As  some  participants  put  it:  '… I am not educated and have no idea on how to send a message .'  P05.  'I cannot use social media or media because it is in English '  P14.

Poverty  emerges  as  another major  hindrance  to the use of ICTs  in political  participation.  Participants  explain  that  rural  populations  have  limited  income  streams  and as  a  result  lack  the  financial  capacity  to  acquire  ICT  devices  like  mobile  phones  and radios  and  to  maintain  the  usage  of  the  devices.  ' Yes, someone might not have the money to buy it (phone, radio) for themselves but most of us struggle to afford it '  P04.  Data indicates  that  often  the  costs  involved  owning  and  maintaining  digital  devices  such  as

mobile  phones  compete  with  limited  financial  capital  needed  to  sustain  their  livelihood. This  results  in  some  individuals  prioritising  sustenance,  which  in  turn  contributes  to  the limited  use  of  e-participation.

Other  factors  that  contribute  to  the  limited  use  of  participation  include  citizens'  fear of  ICTs  use  and  mistrust  in  their  leaders'  ability  to  target  them  for  providing  negative feedback.  Participants  mention  that  citizens  fear  to  use  ICTs  because  they  believe  the devices  can  be  used  to  steal  from  them  while  others  fear  that  the  technologies  are  not secure. They  also  fear that  citizens  voices  can  be  recorded  while  providing  negative feedback  through  e-participation  systems,  and  that  the  government  leaders  could  use the  recordings  against  them.  Due  to  these  fears,  some  citizens  are  not  able  to  actively participate  or  give  negative  feedback.  ' Fear of ICTs not being secure. I could be recorded, and the audio recording can be used against me by government leaders '  P01.  ' I don't like giving negative reports because of the fear of being recorded. The recordings can be used against me' P01 . Participants  also  fear  that  devices  such  as  mobile  phones  can  be used  to  spread  false  information,  as  one  participant  echoes,  ' some are using the phones to spread lies' P09.

According  to  the  data,  citizens'  lack  of  interest  to  attend  meetings  organised  by  their leaders  emerged  as  another  factor  that  can  influence  the  use  of  e-participation.  Attending meetings  is  one  of  the  participatory  processes  through  which  citizens  engage  in  decisionmaking  that  affects  them.  Some  participants  felt  that  attending  meetings  is  a  waste  of time,  as  they  have  a  very  limited  role  to  play,  and  their  voices  are  often  not  recognised in  the  meetings.  One  participant  mentions 'They miss the meeting because it is just a waste of time' P13.  Another  clearly  articulates  for  not  attending  meetings  ' Because I don't play any role in those meetings so I don't care… '  P11.

Furthermore,  while  some  citizens  lack  interest,  others  do  not  attend  the  meetings  due to  lack  of  confidence.  They  mention  that  some  citizens  lack  confidence  and  the  ability  to articulate  their  ideas  and  express  themselves  during  meetings.  ' …It is because of lack of confidence for some not to attend meetings … and for those who are not eloquent doubt themselves if there is a need for them to attend meetings and talk ' P17.  In  sum,  the result  implies  that  even  when  e-participatory  systems  are  deployed,  citizens'  refusal  to attend  meetings  can  influence  the  effective  use  of  the  systems  to  leverage  participatory democratic  processes.

## 4.2 Limited  Technology  Infrastructure

This theme  deals with limited infrastructure in terms of devices, electricity, internet networks  and  telecommunication  networks.  Participants  mention  that  there  is  limited access to  devices like  phones,  radios,  televisions,  computers,  and  smartphones.  This results  in  some  individuals  excluded  from  receiving  information  and  communicating, and  leaders  unable  to  exchange  information  amongst  themselves.

'What can hinder me is when you find that you have no phone, no radio or you rarely interact with community members so they can easily reach you through them. There is no way in such instances how such a person can be reached.' P04.

Analysis  reveals  that  some  areas  do  not  have  internet  while  others  experience  unstable internet  connectivity.  ' Some areas do not have internet '  P07.  ' The internet network is off to post certain information for him .'  P07.  In  addition,  a  majority  of  the  participants

explained  the  lack of electricity as one of the  major  hindrances  to  usage  of ICTs  in political  participation  among  the  rural  population.  The  use  of  ICTs  to  support  public participation  depends  on  the  devices  being  charged,  yet  the  electricity  grid  is  limited  in the  rural  areas. '…Wedon'thaveelectricityinthiscommunityandthetechnologydevices always  work  with  electricity' P09. Participants note that alternative energy sources like  solar  have  been  used,  but  only  a  few  individuals  can  afford  it. 'People use solar for charging' P10.  ' The phones are not charged because many people don't have the capacity to buy solar' P18.

Regarding  limited  telecommunication  networks,  participants  mention  that  the  services  especially  from  MTN  are  either  unreliable  or  usually  off  in  hard-to-reach  rural areas.  One  participant  mentions,  ' …MTN network is unreliable' P10.  This  limitation impacts  on  the  leaders'  ability  to  use  phones  to  communicate  or  receive  information from  citizens.  ' Some don't have good telecommunication networks. You can call the LC1 and other people and you find out that the call is not going through' P07.  Participants  also  mention  that  because  the  areas  are  close  to  the  Tanzania  border,  the  Ugandan  telecommunication  network  is  usually  interfered  with  or  disrupted  by  the  Tanzania telecommunication  networks.  This  is  clearly  articulated  by  this  participant,  ' There is also an issue of poor network because we are very close to Tanzania so the Vodacom masts from Tanzania normally disrupt our network .'  P26.  In  sum,  the  results  reinforce the  perennial  digital  infrastructural  problems  that  hinder  the  effective  and  efficient  use of e-participation in Uganda,  given  its reliant on internet connective  and  accessible, functional  devices  to  the  rural  population.

## 4.3 Society  and  Leadership  Culture

The  society  and  leadership  culture  emerge  as  other  critical  factors  that  the  participants reported  to  influence  e-participation.  The  factors  include  gender-based  discrimination, cultural  beliefs,  leaders'  non-inclusiveness  and  leaders  not  implementing  meeting  outcomes.  Like  many  African  countries,  Uganda  practices  a  dominant  patriarchal  culture where  women,  particularly  in  the  rural  areas,  occupy  subordinate  roles  in  society  such as  cooking  and  looking  after  children  while  men  make  livelihood  decisions.  Participants affirm  this  deep-seated  cultural  practice  by  explaining  that  the  women's  role  is  relegated to  household  chores  like  taking  care  of  the  children,  leaving  them  no  time  to  take  part in  decision-making  processes.  ' I think as a woman, I might not attend these meetings since I have to take care of my children … '  P05.  Regarding  digital  technology  use,  the results  of  this  study  show  that  the  dominant  patriarchal  practice  reinforces  gender-based discrimination  by  limiting  women's  access  to  digital  devices  such  as  mobile  phones. In  particular,  married  women  are  seen  to  be  disadvantaged  as  most  husbands  do  not permit  them  to  own  mobile  phones  or  even  participate  in  decision-making  processes. One  participant  succinctly  puts  it  ' Most men do not want their wives to hold phones' P04 .  Clearly,  not  having  ownership  or  access  to  digital  devices  meant  that  women's  use of  e-participation  could  be  limited,  and  thus  impact  on  how  collective  political  decisions are  made  if  the  goal  is  to  implement  e-participatory  systems  in  rural  Uganda.

Furthermore,  cultural  practice  can  be  seen  to  marginalise  young  people's  inclusion in  decision-making  processes  that  affect  them,  which  forms  the  foundation  of  deliberative  democratic  processes.  According  to  the  result,  it  is  common  for  young  people  to  be

excluded  from  decision-making  during  political  meetings.  Young  participants  felt  that even  when  they  are  invited  to  attend  political  meetings,  only  married  people  mostly  deliberate  and  make  key  decisions.  ' In most cases those meetings are attended by old people so they feel that us youngsters shouldn't attend or make any contribution' P09. Considering  the  importance  of  inclusivity  in  deliberative  political  decision-making,  the  results suggest  that  any  e-participatory  systems  developed  should  consider  women  and  young people's  involvement .

At  a  higher  level,  we  also  found  a  dominant  power  relational  gap  between  community  stakeholders  and  political leaders in  terms  of  information  dissemination  and political  decision-making.  Several  participants  felt  that  leaders  often  exclude  citizens from  decision-making  processes  or  citizens  consultations  on  critical  political  and  social issues in  their  communities.  Some  also  report  that  even  when  citizens  are  invited  or consulted  for  deliberations,  the  leaders  seem  to  discriminate  against  some  during  the deliberations  or  information  dissemination. 'Our leaders here never consult the local people. I think they hold their discussions and decide on their own . ' P05. ' They use phone calls because in cases of consultations our leaders do not invite everyone, they select a few community members' P25. 'Sometimes, some leaders invite people based on their political affiliation or support' P07.  In  addition,  the  participants  highlight  that the  leaders  do  often  not  implement  resolutions  agreed  on  during  the  citizens  and  leaders'  deliberation.  ' And in most cases the matters we discuss are never implemented and that doesn't make us happy '  P12.  In  hindsight,  these  findings  also  highlight  factors  that could  hinder  active  citizens'  engagement  in  e-participatory  systems  when  designed  to facilitate  political  deliberations  between  citizens  and  political  elites.

## 4.4 Enabling  Factors

This  theme  includes  factors  such  as  the  existence  of  local  government  structures  that enable  interactions  between  leaders  and  citizens,  infrastructure  availability,  awareness of the benefits of using ICTs and belief in illiterates making  contributions. Participants  highlight  the  existence  of  Ugandan  hierarchical  local  government  structures  that enable  interaction  of  citizens  and  leaders  from  the  village  level  (Local  Council  1-LC1) to  the  higher-level  leaders.  These  structures  are  believed  to  bridge  the  communication and  information  gaps  between  citizens,  local  and  regional  political  leaders  using  ICTs. Indeed,  the  participants  mention  that  their  leaders  utilise  ICTs,  such  as  market  radios  and mobile  phones,  to  facilitate  the  citizen-leader  interactions  and  information  dissemination.

'… If Local Council 2 - (LC2) wants to disseminate information to LC1, we use LC1 leaders who are made up of 11 committee members. To disseminate the information, they sometimes use mobile phones to call (phone) people including citizens. For the case of LC1, we normally use a market radio or sometimes move door to door to ensure that the information is delivered' P22.

Availability  of  infrastructure  such  as  alternative  solar  energy  sources,  telecommunication  masts,  basic  mobile  phones  and  other  devices  like  smartphones,  radios,  market radios  and  mobile  trumpets  have  made  it  possible  for  the  rural  population  to  own  phones and  the  leaders  to  disseminate  information  to  citizens.  '… sometimes if the leader is not around, I can call or message him on WhatsApp '  P01.  ' In most of those parish development models, I see people collecting data using phones (smartphones)' P25.  Another

participant  comments,  ' Before they told us about it (Parish Development Model), we first heard about it over the radio.' P01.  Further  analysis  shows  the  usefulness  of  the market  radios  in  reaching  out  to  the  wider  community.  As  one  of  the  participants  summarises  ' The Market radios are very good because if someone speaks from it the whole community can hear '  P09.

Another  enabling  factor  revealed  in  the  data  is  the  awareness  of  the  benefits  of  using mobiles  in  political  participation.  Participants  highlight  that  the  use  of  mobile  phones supports  mobility,  receives  first-hand  information  faster  and  protects  users'  privacy.  ' If I have a phone, people can reach out to me from anywhere and at any time '  P24.  ' When they call you, you get first-hand information .'  P23. '…you can convey information to the chairman without other people listening by just giving him a phone call' P05. These findings  reinforce  the  mobility  characteristic  of  mobile  phones  as  well  as  maintaining  privacy,  which  are  critical  for  effective  use  of  e-participation  in  countries  where  patriarchal culture  is  dominant.

## 5 Discussion

The  aim  of  this  research  is  to  analyse  and  understand  the  socio-technical  factors  that inhibit or enable e-participation in rural Uganda. The discussion in this section is presented  under  three  headings:  (1)  the  inhibiting  factors  and  (2)  the  enabling  factors.

## 5.1 The  Inhibiting  Factors

The  results of the inhibiting factors align with  the findings  of [20, 25, 51] and  [28]. Like  our  findings,  these  authors  show  that  citizens'  limited  ICTs  skills,  illiteracy,  limited English  proficiency,  inability  to afford devices,  fear, lack  of  trust  in  government  and e-participation, citizens' lack of confidence  and  interest  hinder  e-participation  adoption and  use. Although  the  contexts  of  these  studies  differ, the factors that  influence e-participation  uptake  and  use  in  Uganda  appear  to  be  generally  consistent.  However, when  a  further  comparison  is  made  across  the  three  studies  in  developed  Germany  [28], semi-developed  Iran  [25]  and  developing  Uganda  [20],  much  of  our  results  support  the work  of  [20]  in  Uganda  although  with  some  differences.  Unlike  [20]  study  that  focuses primarily  on  citizens'  perspective,  our  research  explores  not  only  citizens-related  factors,  but  also  contextual  and  infrastructural  barriers  to  e-participation.  Additionally,  it identifies  enabling  factors,  providing  a  more  holistic  understanding  of  the  elements  that influence  the  effective  use  of  e-participation.  Essentially,  the  study  extends  the  research into  the  importance  of  understanding  specific  users'  settings  and  contexts  when  designing or  customising  e-participation  initiatives  [31].

On  the  infrastructure  side,  the  research  reveals  how  limited  infrastructure,  such  as the  internet,  telecommunication  networks,  ICT  devices  including  mobile  phones  and radios, electricity grid and public participation structures form essential barriers to e-participation adoption. This finding is  important in the  Uganda  context  where  the application of e-participation systems  particularly in the urban areas have struggled to make  a  significant impact  on  inclusive democratic  processes  [50].  It is  envisaged that  our  study  could  provide  the  much-needed  evidence-based  data  for  policymakers  to

develop  contextually  relevant  policies  and  create  the  enabling  environment  for  developing  e-participation  systems  that  reflect  the  contexts  of  the  rural  areas  where  most  of  the Ugandan  population  resides.

The  research  further  demonstrates  the  impact  of  culture  on  e-participation,  which has  also  received  limited  attention  in  literature  [23].  It  highlights  the  dominant  genderpower  relations  that  contribute  to  the  marginalisation  of  women  from  the  ownership and use of digital devices. The reinforcement  of this cultural-enabled digital divide implies  that  women  in  rural  Uganda  have  limited  ability  to  leverage  digital  devices  to participate  in  mediated  decision-making.  The  implication  of  this  finding  suggests  that effective  implementation  of  e-participation  in  rural  Uganda  requires  lowering  barriers to  women's  access  to  digital  devices  considering  that  they  constitute  critical  elements  of the  family  and  community  social  structure  in  Uganda.

Similarly,  the  culture  of  silence  perpetuated  in  the  societal  norms  and  belief  systems in  rural  Uganda  affects  young  people  to  take  part  in  public  participation.  It  creates  a  negative  impact  on  current  and  future  efforts  to  engage  young  people  to  use  e-participation, as  the  majority  may  perceive  it  as  a  replication  of  the  traditional  political  participation [20]. Concerns  about  marginalisation  extends  to  the citizens-leaders power  relations where  most  citizens  felt  excluded  from  critical  political  consultative  meetings  because of  their  political  affiliations.  These  findings  indicate  that  such  practices  play  a  critical role  in  reinforcing  inequalities  and  limiting  citizens'  participation,  and  consequently  the effective  use  of  e-participation  [6,  20,  53].  In  all,  our  findings  suggest  that  strengthening citizens'  capabilities  and  improving  ICT  infrastructure  and  cultural  practice  are  essential for  achieving  e-participation  uptake.  To  achieve  this,  the  study  has  identified  the  specific factors  that  should  be  explored  and  addressed  when  planning,  designing  and  implementing  e-participation  models  and  systems.  The  emphasis  on  identifying  and  improving these  factors  corroborates  with  the  earlier  research  by  [13,  20,  25].

## 5.2 The  Inhibiting  Factors

The  findings  on  enabling  factors  as  earlier  reiterate  the  works  of  [5,  25]  and  [28],  who identified  enabling  factors  to  those  analysed  in  the  result  section.  It  highlights  the  role  of structural  transformation  to  shape  political  participation  at  the  local  level  when  mediated through  ICTs.  This  result  aligns  with  [52]  study  where  political  efficacy  combined  with citizens'  trust  in  the  political  structures  emerged  as  key  enablers  of  e-participation  use. However,  the  Uganda  finding  provides  an  interesting  dichotomy.  On  the  one  hand,  the political  culture  practice  perpetuates  unequal  power  relations  and  limits  some  groups of citizens to participate equally in traditional deliberative  political  decision-making (see above).  On  the  other hand,  the  introduction  of ICTs  is perceived  to serve as an enabler  for  citizens'  participation.  Further  analysis  of  the  results  reveals  that  awareness of  the  benefits  of  ICTs  is  a  key  factor  underpinning  their  effectiveness  as  an  enabler for  political  participation.  This  is  shaped  by  the  belief  that  ICTs  such  as  mobile  phones offer  features  that  protect  their  privacy  and  replicate  traditional  forms  of  face-to-face  oral communication. Additionally,  the  participants  mentioned  that  the  mobility  and  timeliness of  mobile  devices  characterise  their  perceived  usefulness  in  facilitating  the  interactions between  citizens  and  political  leaders.

Additionally, participants highlighted that the mobility and timeliness of  mobile devices  enhance  their  perceived  usefulness  in  facilitating  interactions  between  citizens and  political  leaders.  Although  there  is  no  specific  e-participation  system  deployed  in rural  Uganda,  the  perceived  advantages  of  mobile  devices  for  facilitating  political  participation  offers  useful  insights  for  mobile  phone-enabled  e-participation.  In  general, the  findings  corroborate  with  [36]  study  where  time  savings,  location  independence  and cost  reduction  emerged  as  the  advantages  for  e-participation.

Our  study  further  found  that  the  motivation  of  rural  citizens  to  use  ICTs  for  political engagement  is  a  key  factor  in  shaping  the  development  of  e-participation.  However,  considering  that  a  majority  of  the  rural  citizens  are  both  digitally  and  functionally  illiterate, it  is  important  to  recognise  that  harnessing  their  motivations  and  enhancing  their  active engagement  in  e-participation  requires  targeted  training  [21].  In  all,  this  finding  extends the work by [39]  that  a  lack of understanding  of  citizens' motivations  to participate hinders  the  progress  of  e-participation.

## 6 Conclusion  and  Future  Work

In  general,  the  study  contributes  to  the  limited  empirical  research  on  the  usage  of  information  communication  technologies  in  political  participation  in  rural  areas  [28] by presenting  the  factors  that  influence  e-participation  in  rural  Uganda.  This  research  provides both  technical  and  non-technical  (social,  political)  factors.  It  aims  to  provide  a  holistic  approach  for  establishing  factors  that  influence  e-participation  use,  which  has  been reported  to  be  limited  in  existing  research  [52].  By  drawing  on  citizens  and  government  leaders'  experience  and  socio-technical  context  data,  we  analysed  and  discussed both  the  factors  that  enhance  and  inhibit  the  adoption  and  use  of  e-participation  in  rural Uganda.  The  study  shows  that  a  wide  range  of  individual  factors  and  institutional  and socio-cultural  practices  seem  to  play  a  limited  role  for  the  update  of  ICTs  to  mediate political  participation.  Beyond  the  factors  related  to  the  limited  use  of  e-participation, factors  such  as  local  government  structures,  telecommunication  infrastructure  availability  and  awareness  benefits  of  ICTs  can  be  seen  to  play  an  important  role  in  observed  use of  ICTs  for  political  participation.

In  addition,  as  there  is  limited  research  on  various  stakeholders'  perspectives  on  factors  that  influence  e-participation  [21,  23],  this  research  makes  a  significant  contribution by  providing  technical  and  non-technical  factors  that  are  informed  by  rural  citizens  and local  government  leaders  in  rural  Isingiro,  Uganda,  Africa.  The  study  further  extends research  by  [20]  who  recommended  the  need  to  establish  factors  based  on  local  government  leaders'  perspectives.  Moreover,  the  findings  identify inhibiting factors that contribute  to  advancing  research  on  the  limited  knowledge  of  barriers  to  e-participation implementation  in  developing  countries  [25].  Furthermore,  the  factors  identified  can guide  e-participation  designers  and  implementers  to  consider  different  aspects  like  social, political,  economic  and  technology  during  the  designing  and  implementation  of  effective e-participation systems  and  models  that  align with the users' context [12].Also, the  inhibiting  and  enabling  factors  identified  can  guide  researchers,  designers,  policymakers,  and  governments  to  establish  strategies  to  address  contextual  challenges  during the  planning,  designing,  implementation  and  evaluation  of  e-participation  models  and systems  particularly  in  similar  settings  with  similar  features  and  characteristics.

Overall, the findings provide researchers, governments, policymakers, and eparticipation  designers  evidence-based  information  to  determine  necessary  conditions for  e-participation  models  and  systems  design  and  implementation  in  settings  similar  to rural  Uganda.  However,  the  research  was  based  on  a  case  study  of  only  two  parishes  in a  district  in  Uganda  and  was  carried  out  in  a  limited  time.  This  limits  generalisation  and the  findings  transferability  could  only  be  applicable  to  settings  with  similar  characteristics.  Future  work  will  focus  on  using  these  socio-technical  contextual  factors  to  elicit e-participation  model  and  system  requirements.

Abstract. Digitalization  is  transforming  democracy  by  enabling  new  forms  of political  participation  through  e-participation  and  e-democracy.  While  these  concepts  use  ICT  to  engage  citizens  in  democratic  decision-making,  trust  remains  a key  challenge.  In  this  study,  we  investigate  citizens'  awareness,  knowledge,  and use  of  e-participation  in  the  metropolitan  area  of  Koblenz  in  Germany.  Along  a literature  review,  we  first  identified  key  influencing  factors.  Subsequently,  a  survey was  conducted  with  217  respondents  from  one  city  and  five  administrative  districts. The  results  from  the  survey  indicate  low  awareness,  with  citizens  recognizing  basic forms  like  e-information,  while  largely  being  unfamiliar  with  interactive  methods such  as  e-consultation  and  e-collaboration.  Many  citizens  are  unaware  of,  or  do  not engage  with  local  e-participation  opportunities,  limiting  their  involvement  to  passive  information  access.  Trust  in  e-participation  is  shaped  by  factors  such  as  data protection,  IT  security,  transparency,  and  perceived  political  impact.  The  findings highlight  the  need  for  improved  communication  strategies  and  targeted  initiatives to  enhance  awareness  and  promote  active  citizen  engagement.

## 1 Introduction

Digitalization  is  fundamentally  transforming  democracy,  offering  new  opportunities  for political  participation  and  strengthening  democratic  processes  [1,  2].  E-participation  and e-democracy  are  key  concepts  to  involve  citizens  as  key  stakeholders  in  public  policy processes.  E-democracy  uses  ICT  to  foster  democratic  motivation  and  innovation,  connecting  politicians  and  citizens  through  information,  voting,  elections,  and  discussions through  e-participation  [3].  E-democracy  aims  to  enhance  democratic  systems  and  citizen  engagement  by  empowering  individuals  through  digital  offerings.  Thereby,  ICT  is expected  to  improving  democracy  and  overcoming  physical  barriers  [4-7].

E-participation,  a  form  of  digital  civic  engagement,  involves  citizens  in  political  processes  through  digital  media  [8,  9].  Its  broad  definition  includes  citizen  participation  at various  stages  of  public  engagement.  The  objective  is  to  enhance  citizens'  voices  in  political  processes  through  ICT,  ensuring  transparent  and  accountable  governance  [10].  By promoting  dialogue  between  governments  and  citizens,  e-participation  has  the  potential

to  expand  democratic  dialogue  and  foster  more  inclusive  governance  [11].  In  the  literature,  e-participation  is  characterized  by  different  levels  of  engagement:  e-informing (digital  provision  of  information  without  active  citizen  participation),  e-consulting  (gathering  opinions  through,  for  example,  surveys  or  forums  without  direct  involvement),  ecollaborating  (active  citizen  participation  in  political  processes),  and  e-empowering  (the highest  level  of  participation  through,  for  example,  binding  referendums  and  citizens deciding  on  policy  matters)  illustrate  the  degree  of  citizen  involvement  in  digital  participation  processes  [8,  12].  Some  publications  mention  a  further  level  of  e-participation: E-Involvement,  which  refers  to  active  participation  and  online  work  with  citizen  [13]. However,  a  key  challenge  is  building  and  maintaining  citizens'  trust  in  the  political  system,  which  is  crucial  for  the  use  of  e-participation  projects  [14,  15].  Factors  influencing trust  have  been  studied  extensively  [14-16].  This  research  extends  that  work  by  investigating  general  knowledge,  awareness  and  use  of  e-participation  in  the  German  regional context  of  the  metropolitan  area  of  Koblenz,  Rhineland-Palatinate.

The  objective  of  our  study  is  to  examine  citizens'  knowledge  of  e-participation  and their  awareness  as  well  as  their  use  of  available  e-participation  offerings  in  their  region. Based  on a literature analysis, we execute a standardized survey to assess citizens' awareness  and  knowledge  of  e-participation  in  the  metropolitan  region.  The  following two  research  questions  guide  our  study:

- RQ1:  What  factors  influence  the  use  and  awareness  of  e-participation  endeavors?
- RQ2: What is the level of knowledge about e-participation initiatives in the metropolitan  area  of  Koblenz,  Germany?

The  paper  is  structured  as  follows:  Sect.  2  reviews  existing  literature  along  [17]  and [18]  to  ground  the  empirical  research  and  to  identify  factors  influencing  awareness  and use  of  e-participation.  Section  3  outlines  the  methodological  approach  for  the  qualitative study. Section 4 presents the findings from the empirical research, introducing into contextual  factors  of  the  metropolitan  region  of  Koblenz,  Germany,  and  to  the  analysis of  the  survey  results.  Section  5  discusses  and  reflects  the  findings  gathered,  while  Sect.  6 concludes  the  study  and  provides  an  outlook  for  future  research.

## 2 Factors  Influencing  E-Participation  Usage  and  Awareness Identified  in  Scientific  Literature

Through  e-participation  initiatives,  citizens  gain  access  to  additional  ICT-based  participation  opportunities.  However,  the  mere  existence  of  digital  tools  does  not  necessarily guarantee  their  adoption  and  recognition  of  potentials  for  active  citizen  participation. This  section  examines  the  factors  influencing  the  use  and  awareness  of  e-participation as discussed  in scientific literature, thereby focusing on factors that enhance  citizen awareness,  and  that  encourage  their  use  of  existing  e-participation  initiatives.

Santamaría-Philco  and  Wimmer  reviewed  a  number  of  factors  that  directly  influence trust  in  e-participation  initiatives,  such  as  the  'quality  of  information',  'trust  in  technology',  'trust  in  the  process/transparency  of  the  process',  'trust  in  contributions/quality of  contribution',  'trust  in  conditions  of  participation',  'trust  in  data  security/protection'

and  'influence  on  decision-making'  [15].  Other  studies  indicate  that,  in  particular,  transparency  of  participation  initiatives  and  their  actual  impact  on  decision-making  processes significantly  affect  the  perceived  benefits  of  and  trust  in  e-participation  [14].  On  the  one hand, e-participation can  provide  transparent  insights  into  political  decision-making; on  the  other  hand,  it  requires  digital  tools  that  facilitate  dialogue  between  citizens  and government  [15,  19].  Furthermore,  research  by  Kim  and  Lee  as  well  as  Choi  and  Song found  that  a  higher  level  of  trust  in  the  government  or  institutions  positively  influences the  use  of  e-participation  channels  [20,  21]-an  observation  also  confirmed  by  Abdulkareem  et  al.  [22].  Their  findings  suggest  that  high-quality  and  user-friendly  digital  public services  have  a  positive  effect  on  participation  levels.  However,  in  countries  with  underdeveloped  digital  administrative  infrastructures,  trust  and  engagement  in  e-participation tend  to  be  lower  [22].  Based  on  the  trust  model  by  Mayer,  Davis  and  Schoorman  [24], Scherer  and  Wimmer  argue  that  people  will  refrain  from  using  e-participation  services if  they  are  uncertain  about  the  risks  associated  with  data  protection  or  IT  security.  Furthermore,  obvious  vulnerabilities  in  ICT  applications  also  lead  to  a  loss  of  trust  on  the part  of  political  actors  and  the  government  as  a  whole  [23].  Considering  user  needs  and inclusivity  is  also  crucial  for  the  acceptance  and  usage  of  digital  participation  platforms. Targeted  functionalities tailored to  specific  user  groups  enhance  citizens'  motivation to  engage  [25,  26].  Different  demographics  require  distinct  approaches:  while  younger users  favor  gamified  applications,  older  citizens  often  require  training  to  participate  in online  formats  [27,  28].  In  general,  the  more  familiar  citizens  are  with  an  application, the  more  likely  they  are  to  engage  with  it.

Technological  advancements  also  play  a  key  role  in  increasing  the  adoption  of  eparticipation  platforms  [25].  Additionally,  the  habitual  use  of  such  applications  fosters a  sense  of  belonging  within  communities,  further  encouraging  consistent  participation [11].  Finally,  studies  have  compared  digital  participation  with  traditional  methods.  A  key insight  is  that  time  efficiency  in  e-participation  encourages  greater  involvement.  Additionally,  the  digital  presence  and  visibility  of  participation  opportunities  significantly influence  their  adoption  [29,  30].

The  literature  review  indicates  that  existing  research  predominantly  focuses  on  the implementation  of  e-participation  across  various  contexts,  the  development  of  theoretical frameworks,  and  their  application  in  different  countries,  cities,  and  regions  [16,  31-34]. However,  the identification of factors that influence the actual  usage  and  awareness of  e-participation  offerings  remains  an  underexplored  area.  There  is  a  notable  lack  of comprehensive  datasets  and  empirical  studies  that  provide  a  realistic  assessment  of  the extent  to  which  existing  e-participation  services  are  known  and  regularly  utilized.  In particular,  no  direct  results  were  found  in  the  search  for  contributions  to  citizen  awareness in  the  context  of  e-participation  offerings.

## 3 Survey  Design  and  Execution

Quantitative social research collects and analyzes numerical data to describe social phenomena,  test  hypotheses,  and  draw  generalizable  conclusions  [35].  It  uses  methods like surveys  and  statistical analysis to  make  inferences  about  larger  populations  and to identify correlations. A key tool is  the  standardized  questionnaire,  which  ensures

comparability  by  asking  the  same  questions  in  the  same  order.  In  our  study,  we  use  a standardized  survey,  following  a  linear  process  from  theory  to  data  analysis  [36].

A  key  element  of  any  scientific  study  is  the  formulation  of  the  research  problem, which  guides  the  research  design.  Our  research  problem  is  defined  through  literature review  and  theoretical  considerations  [17,  18].  Based  on  the  research  questions  of  this paper, the study aims to assess i) the level of knowledge,  awareness  and use of eparticipation  among  citizens  in  the  German  metropolitan  area  of  Koblenz,  and  ii)  what factors  influence  trust  of  citizens  in  e-participation  initiatives  positively  or  negatively.

The  study  adopts  a  cross-sectional  design,  which  analyzes  relevant  variables  at  a single point in time. A  longitudinal  design  is  not used, as the study  does  not aim  to examine  changes  over  time.  Simple  random  sampling  is  employed  to  select  the  study sample,  ensuring  all  population  elements  have  an  equal  chance  of  inclusion.  The  population  consists  of  residents  of  five  administrative  districts  (Landkreise)  and  one  large  city within  the  Koblenz  metropolitan  area  (see  Table  1).  The  sample  reflects  the  proportional distribution  of  inhabitants  across  the  area.  A  minimum  of  200  respondents  is  targeted  to ensure  result  validity.  Table  1  therefore  also  outlines  the  required  number  of  participants per  district/city.

Data  is  collected  through  a  partially  standardized  survey  using  a  questionnaire  as  the primary  instrument.  The  questionnaire  includes  17  closed  questions,  enabling  the  collection  of  standardized  quantitative  data,  which  allows  for  easy  comparison  and  statistical analysis  of  correlations.  Questions  q1  to  q11  target  the  below  program  questions,  while q14  to  q19  are  demographics  questions.  Two  open-ended  questions  explore  additional influencing  factors  relevant  to  the  study  (q12  assessing  own  media  competency  and  q13 assessing  own  trust  in  local  government  structures).  The  survey  is  internet-based  using

UmfrageOnline 1  .  As  not  all  respondents  can  be  reached  digitally,  paper  versions  are collected  at  public  events  and  highly  frequented  locations.

The  empirical  study  is  framed  by  the  following  five  program  questions:

1. General Awareness: What do citizens in the region know  about e-participation? (belonging  to  part  i)  above,  and  covering  questions  q1  and  q2).
2. Local  Awareness:  How  familiar  are  citizens  with  online  participation  opportunities in  their  district  or  city?  (belonging  to  part  i)  above,  and  covering  q3  to  q5).
3. Positive  Influences:  To  what  extent  do  certain  factors  enhance  citizens'  trust  in  eparticipation  initiatives?  (belonging  to  part  ii)  above,  and  covering  q6  and  a7).
4. Negative  Influences:  To  what  extent  do  certain  factors  undermine  citizens'  trust  in e-participation  initiatives?  (belonging  to  part  ii)  above,  covering  q9 - q10).
5. Additional Factors: Are there other factors that impact citizens' trust in eparticipation?  (belonging  to  part  ii)  above,  and  covering  q8  and  q11).

The  survey  was  conducted  from  16/09/2024  to  30/10/2024.  It  faced  the  challenge of  reaching  a  representative  sample.  To  meet  the  target  figures  indicated  in  Table  1, we distributed  the  survey  via  university  members,  sports  and  cultural  associations,  voluntary organizations,  and  political  parties.  QR-coded  posters  in  government  offices  and  public events  in  each  district  further  boosted  participation.  Paper  questionnaires  were  collected and  digitized  for  analysis.

## 4 Findings  from  the  Empirical  Research

The  survey  results  are  analyzed  based  on  responses  to  the  five  program  questions  indicated  in  the  previous  section.  A  total  of  248  responses  were  collected  (online  submissions and  paper  questionnaires  combined),  with  217  fully  completed  questionnaires.  To  ensure data  quality  and  avoid  distortions,  only  completed  responses  are  considered  in  this  study.

## 4.1 Socio-demographic  Description  of  the  Participants  (Q14  to  Q19)

The  socio-demographic  data  covers  216  respondents'  regional  distribution.  The  City of  Koblenz  (A)  had  the  highest  share  (29.17%,  63  people),  followed  by  the  Administrative  District  Neuwied  (B)  (24.54%,  53  people).  The  Administrative  District  Mayen Koblenz  (F)  had  a  share  of  11.57%,  closely  followed  by  the  Administrative  Districts Rhein-Hunsrück  (D)  and  Westerwald  (E)  who  had  a  share  of  10.65%  each,  and  finally Administrative  District Rhein-Lahn  (C)  with  a share  of  9.72%.  Additionally,  3.24% (7  people)  lived  elsewhere,  and  one  respondent  did  not  specify  the  place  of  residence. While  the  City  of  Koblenz  (A)  and  the  Administrative  District  Neuwied  (B)  are  overrepresented,  the  Administrative  Districts  Rhein-Hunsrück  (D)  and  Westerwald  (F)  are underrepresented  regarding  the  overall  population  share.

Among  215  respondents,  gender  distribution  was  with  54.42%  male  and  44.19% female,  while  1.40%  was  unspecified.  The  largest  age  group  (37.76%)  was  18-29  years, followed  by the  age  groups  30-44  (31.63%),  45-59  (19.39%),  and  60 + (10.20%).

One  respondent was under 18. Educational levels varied: 30.70%  held a university degree, 29.77%  a vocational baccalaureate or graduation from high  school,  19.07% vocational  training,  9.30%  a  secondary  school  certificate,  1.86%  a  lower  secondary  certificate,  and  6.51%  a  doctorate.  Employment  status  also  varied:  46.76%  were  employed, 32.87%  students,  7.87%  self-employed,  6.94%  pensioners,  and  4.63%  unemployed.  Two respondents  did  not  specify  their  employment  status.

## 4.2 Knowledge  of  E-Participation  by  Citizens  in  General  (Q1  and  Q2)

To  assess  awareness,  respondents  were  first  asked  whether  they  had  heard  of  the  term 'e-participation'  already.  Of  the  217  respondents,  60.83%  (132  people)  were  unfamiliar with  the  term  before  the  survey,  while  38.71%  (84  people)  recognized  it.  One  person did  not  respond  (see  Fig.  1).  These  findings  suggest  that  e-participation  remains  largely unknown  among  the  population, highlighting the need for educational initiatives to increase  awareness  and  promote  digital  citizen  participation.

Fig.  1. General  knowledge  of  e-participation  (q1)

<!-- image -->

Awareness  of  'e-participation'  varies  by  age.  Among  those  under  45,  55.47%  were unfamiliar  with  the  term,  compared  to  70.69%  of  those  over  45.  This  suggests  younger participants are more  aware  of e-participation. University graduates were  also  more familiar  with  the  term,  while  other  factors  like  gender,  employment,  nationality,  and  residence  had  no  significant  impact.  Regarding  specific  e-participation  levels  (and  exemplary areas)  (q2),  e-information  (e.g.,  official  websites)  was  the  most  recognized  (70.51%,  153 respondents).  E-consultation  (e.g.,  urban  planning  platforms)  was  known  by  41.94% (91  respondents),  e-collaboration  (e.g.,  participatory  budgeting)  by  21.20%  (46  respondents),  and  e-empowerment  (e.g.,  binding  referendums)  by  just  11.98%  (26  respondents). Notably,  29.03%  (63  respondents)  were  unfamiliar  with  any  of  the  levels  of  engagement and  exemplary  applications.  The  results  indicate  that,  while  basic  e-information  services are  widely  known,  more  interactive  forms  and  levels  of  engagement  such  as  consultation, collaboration,  and  empowerment  require  greater  awareness  and  promotion  (see  Fig.  2).

The  response  patterns  across  the  City  of  Koblenz  and  the  Administrative  Districts in  the  metropolitan  area  are  similar,  with e-information and e-consultation being  the most  recognized  levels  of  e-participation.  However,  a  significant  number  of  respondents

Fig.  2. Levels  of  e-participation  offerings  familiar  to  use  (q2,  multiple  answers).

<!-- image -->

remain  unfamiliar  with  any  application  level.  This  suggests  that  knowledge  of  more interactive and participatory e-participation remains low, regardless of location.  We conclude  that,  while  basic,  passive  forms  of  e-participation  are  relatively  well-known, awareness  of  advanced,  interactive  levels  of  engagement  is  limited.

## 4.3 Knowledge  of  E-Participation  Availability  (Q3  and  Q4)

On  the  respondents'  awareness  of  local  e-participation  services  (q3,  n = 217),  64.06% (139  people)  were  familiar  with  e-information,  but  awareness  of  interactive  participation was  significantly  lower.  E-consultation  (e.g.,  urban  planning  platforms)  was  known  by 27.19%  (59  people),  while  e-collaboration  (e.g.,  participatory  budgeting)  was  recognized by  just  2.76%  (6  people).  Only  one  respondent  (0.46%)  was  aware  of  e-empowerment initiatives  like  binding  referendums.  Notably,  32.72%  (71  respondents)  were  unfamiliar with  any  local  e-participation  application.  This  suggests  that,  despite  available  digital participation,  many  residents  remain  unaware  of  such  offerings.

When  analyzing  e-participation  initiatives,  the  frequency,  with  which  citizens  take part  in  e-participation,  is  a  decisive  factor  in  the  response  (q4).  Of  the  217  respondents, 39.63%  (86  people)  had  never  used  an  e-participation  application.  A  further  33.64% (73  people)  participated  infrequently  (less  than  three  times  a  year),  indicating  sporadic engagement  even  among  those  who  were  familiar  with  these  tools.  A  smaller  group  used e-participation  occasionally  (20.74%,  45  people)  or  frequently  (3.69%,  8  people),  while only  5  people  (2.30%)  said  they  used  it  very  frequently  (more  than  ten  times  a  year). These  results  show  that  although  awareness  exists,  regular  and  active  participation  is still  low  (see  Fig.  3).

Question  5  goes  on  to  analyze,  which  specific  applications  these  users  have  engaged with. This question identifies the most used forms of digital civic participation and highlights  usage  gaps.  Among  132  respondents,  94.70%  (125  people)  engaged  with  einformation  services  (e.g.,  official  websites),  confirming  that  passive  information  access is the most widespread  form  of e-participation. In contrast, interactive participation remains  low:  38.64%  (51  people)  used  e-consultation  (e.g.,  participation  platforms),

Fig.  3. Frequency  of  use  of  e-participation  offerings  (q4)

<!-- image -->

while  only  9.09%  (12  people)  engaged  in  e-collaboration  (e.g.,  participatory  budgeting). E-empowerment,  the  most  participatory  form  and  highest  level  of  engagement  (e.g., binding  referendums),  was  used  by  just  1.52%  (2  people).  These  findings  highlight  a strong  preference  for  information  access  over  active  digital  participation.

The  survey  found  that  younger  respondents,  particularly  those  under  45,  are  more aware  of local e-participation opportunities. While  32.72%  of  the  respondents  were unfamiliar  with  any  applications,  this  drops  to  27.01%  among  those  under  45,  indicating  greater  familiarity  within  this  age  group.  Younger  respondents  also  reported  higher usage:  32.85%  had  never  engaged  with  e-participation,  compared  to  39.63%  of  the  total sample.  This  suggests  that  younger  citizens  are  not  only  better  informed  but  also  more active  in  digital  participation.  Regional  differences  had  no  significant  impact  on  awareness  or  usage,  as  response  patterns  were  consistent  across  all  Administrative  Districts and  the  City.  In  summary,  knowledge  of  online  participation  remains  limited.  While passive e-information  services  are  recognized  and  occasionally  used,  interactive  and co-determining  forms  are  less  known  and  utilized.  Younger  citizens  are  slightly  more engaged  than  older  ones,  but  overall  participation  remains  low.

## 4.4 Factors  Influencing  Trust  in  the  E-Participation  Initiatives  (Questions  6-13)

To  address  the  third  program  question  on  positive  influencing  factors,  we  analyze  questions  six  and  seven.  Q6  asks  respondents  to  rate  the  positive  influence  of  factors  on  their trust  in  e-participation:  a)  user  friendliness,  b)  compliance  to  data  protection  regulations, c) securing  the  technical  system,  d)  seamless  technical  availability  of  e-participation tools,  and  e)  guaranteeing  protection  against  malicious  usage  by  the  users.  The  rating scale  ranges  from  1  (no  positive  influence)  to  5  (very  strong  positive  influence),  with  an option  for  'No  answer.'

The  user-friendliness  of  e-participation  tools  received  a  mean  score  of  3.28  and  a standard  deviation  of  1.2,  indicating  some  variability  in  responses.  While  48.35%  of respondents  (65  rated  'high'  and  37  'very  high')  believe  that usability has a strong positive  influence  on  trust,  30.33%  (64  people)  rated  it  low  or  very  low.  About  7%  of respondents  felt  that  usability  had  no  positive  impact  on  their  trust,  suggesting  that  while important,  usability  is  not  the  primary  factor  for  everyone.

In  contrast,  privacy  emerged  as  a  more  consistent  and  influential  factor,  with  a  mean score of 3.89 and a low standard deviation of 0.97, indicating broad agreement  on its  importance.  Nearly  74%  of  participants  (47.39%  rated  'high'  and  27.01%  'very high')  believe  that  strong  data  protection  regulations  significantly  enhance  their  trust  in e-participation  applications  (see  Fig.  4).

The  security  of  technical  systems  (IT  security)  received  a  high  mean  score  of  3.97 with  a  standard  deviation  of  1.0,  indicating  strong  and  consistent  agreement  on  its  positive influence  on  trust.  71.7%  of  respondents  rated  IT  security  as  having  either  a  high  or  very high  impact  on  trust,  highlighting  its  central  role  in  fostering  trust.  IT  security  is  therefore seen as a fundamental  element  for trust in e-participation applications and is a key prerequisite  for  many  citizens'  engagement.  The  technical  availability  of  applications scored  a  mean  of  3.02  with  a  relatively  high  standard  deviation  of  1.35,  reflecting  a  wider spread  in  responses.  While  27.36%  rated  availability  as  high  and  15.57%  as  very  high, 18.87%  felt  it  had  no  positive  impact  on  trust  in  using  the  e-participation  application. These  mixed  responses  suggest  that  while  reliable  availability  is  important,  it is less critical  for  trust  compared  to  factors  like  security  and  privacy.  Protection  against  misuse received one of the highest scores, 4.0, with a standard  deviation  of 0.97, reflecting strong  consensus  on  its  importance.  78.26%  of  respondents  rated  it  as  having  a  high or  very  high  impact  on  trust,  emphasizing  the  importance  of  integrity  and  fairness  in e-participation.  Citizens  are  more  likely  to  trust  e-participation  applications,  when  there is  strong  protection  against  misuse.

Q7  quested  on  non-technical  factors  influencing  trust  positively  (see  Fig.  4).  While 140  people  reported  high  or  very  high  positive  assessment  on  granting  political  impact, 29  argued  no  or  very  low  positive  impact,  the  mean  value  being  7,3.  6  persons  did  not respond  to  this  question.  The  second  aspect,  ensuring  trust  in  the  participation  process, received  a  mean  score  of  3,91,  with  a  standard  deviation  of  1,1.  155  people  reported  a  high

or  very  high  positive  influence  on  trust.  The  third  aspect,  granting  own  anonymity  was assessed  with  higher  importance,  with  a  mean  score  of  4,11  and  a  standard  deviation  of 0,99.  Finally,  protection  against  malicious  use  of  recorded  data  was  rated  as  the  highest important  aspect,  with  4,16  mean  score  and  0,99  standard  deviation.  The  number  of respondents  assessing  a  high  or  very  high  positive  impact  on  trust  is  166  (Fig.  5).

For the fourth program  question, q9 and q10 explored possible negative factors affecting  trust  in  the  use  of  e-participation  initiatives.  Respondents  rated  the  same  factors as  in  questions  six  and  seven,  but  this  time  on  the  negative  impact  of  their  presence  or absence,  using  a  scale  from  1  (no  negative  impact)  to  5  (very  strong  negative  impact). The  means  and  standard  deviations  reveal  the  most  significant  barriers  to  trust  in  digital participation:  The  lack  of  user-friendliness  of  e-participation  tools  received  a  mean  score of 3.02 with a high standard  deviation  of  1.41, indicating  considerable  variability  in responses. 29.58%  of  respondents (63 people) rated the lack of user-friendliness as having  a  very  negative  impact,  while  16.43%  (35  people)  rated  it  as  very  high.  However, 21.13%  (45  people)  felt  it  had  no  negative  impact,  and  17.84%  (38  people)  viewed  it as  having  a  very  low  negative  impact.  These  mixed  ratings  suggest  that,  while  a  lack  of usability  can  negatively  affect  trust,  it  is  not  seen  as  a  critical  factor  by  other  respondents. Non-compliance  with  data  protection  laws  is  seen  as  one  of  the  most  serious  barriers  to trust  in  the  use,  with  a  mean  score  of  3.72  and  a  standard  deviation  of  1.08.  38.5%  of respondents  (82  people)  rated  this  factor  as  having  a  high  negative  impact,  and  26.29% (56  people)  rated  it  as  very  high.  These  results  highlight  that  citizens  develop  significant mistrust towards e-participation initiatives if data protection laws are not respected, making  this  a  critical  barrier  to  trust  in  using  the  offering.  IT  security  vulnerabilities  are also  perceived  as  a  major  negative  factor,  with  a  high  mean  score  of  4.03  and  a  standard deviation  of  0.98.  39.15%  of  respondents  (83  people)  rated  security  flaws  as  having  a very  negative  impact,  and  33.49%  (71  people)  rated  them  as  highly  negative.  Only  1.42% (3  people)  did  not  perceive  IT  security  vulnerabilities  as  having  a  negative  impact.  These

findings  underscore  that  security  flaws  are  a  significant  barrier  to  trust,  likely  deterring potential  users  from  engaging  with  e-participation.  Application  failures  scored  a  mean of  3.08  with  a  standard  deviation  of  1.22,  indicating  a  moderate  negative  impact.  29.86% (63  people)  felt  that  failures  had  a  high  negative  impact,  while  12.32%  (26  people)  rated them  as  very  high.  However,  12.32%  (26  people)  reported  no  negative  impact,  and  21.8% (46  people)  rated  the  impact  as  very  low.  This  suggests  that  while  failures  can  negatively influence  trust,  their  impact  is  seen  as  less  critical  compared  to  factors  like  privacy  and IT  security.  Finally,  the  lack  of  protection  against  misuse  achieved  a  mean  of  3.89  and a  low  standard  deviation  of  0.97,  indicating  a  high  level  of  agreement  on  its  negative impact.  45.75%  of  respondents  (97  people)  rated  the  lack  of  protection  against  misuse  as highly  negative,  and  27.83%  (59  people)  rated  it  as  very  high.  Only  1.89%  (4  people)  felt that  this  factor  did  not  negatively  affect  their  trust.  This  strong  response  highlights  that citizens  place  great  importance  on  the  integrity  and  fairness  of  e-participation  processes, and  a  lack  of  protection  against  misuse  can  severely  damage  trust.

On  the  negative  impact  q10  assessed  the  following  four  aspects:  no  clear  indication on political impact  of initiative (with a mean  score  of  3,3 and standard  deviation  of 1,06  -  93  respondents  assessed  high  or  very  high  negative  impact,  while  44  persons report  very  low  or  no  negative  impact),  intransparency  on  the  participation  process  (with a  mean  score  of  3,73  and  standard  deviation  of  1,18  -  144  persons  assessed  high  or very  high  negative  impact,  while  35  persons  report  very  low  or  no  negative  impact),  no anonymity  (mean  score  3,84,  standard  deviation  of  1,05  -  148  persons  assessed  high  or very  high  negative  impact,  while  26  persons  report  very  low  or  no  negative  impact),  and lack  of  protection  against  misuse  of  recorded  data  (mean  score  3,93,  standard  deviation of  1,04  -  137  persons  assessed  high  or  very  high  negative  impact,  while  24  persons report  very  low  or  no  negative  impact).  The  findings  indicate  that  the  most  influential negative  impact  factors  are  lack  of  transparency,  lack  of  anonymity  and  low  protection against  misuse  of  recorded  data.

The  open  questions  eight  and  eleven  queried  additional  factors  influencing  trust  in e-participation  to  address  the  fifth  program  question.  In  contrast  to  the  closed  questions, the  willingness  to  answer  these  questions  was  significantly  lower,  with  only  24  people answering  question  eight  and  15  people  answering  question  eleven  on  the  influence  of positive  or  negative  factors.  While  on  q8,  8  people  reported  again  user-friendliness,  7 people  reported  again  transparency  of  the  participation  process,  and  one  the  political impact  of  the  initiative,  four  new  aspects  were  reported,  i.e.  personal  benefit  of  the  user (1  mention),  more  awareness  (2),  trust  in  institutions  (4)  and  possibility  of  participating in  planning  processes  (1).  Similarly,  on  q11  (negative  impact  factors),  3  respondents reported  again  lack  of  user  friendliness  of  tools,  3  respondents  reported  again  weaknesses  in  IT  security,  and  5  respondents  reported  again  lack  of  clarity  about  political impact. The  three new  items  reported  were  a) personal  disadvantages  of  the user in participating  (1  -  the  participant  worries  that  e-participation  outcomes  may  negatively affect  him  or  her,  such  as  political  decisions  against  their  interests);  b)  lack  of  awareness, where  2 respondents  feel uninformed  about  the existence and functionality of e-participation  tools,  which  undermines  trust  and  engagement;  and  c)  distrust  in  institutions,  with  1  respondent  indicating  that  credibility  and  transparency  of  the  implementing organizations  are  essential  to  maintaining  trust  in  e-participation  tools.

## 4.5 Assessment  of  Own  Media  Literacy  and  Trust  in  Local  Administration

Question  12  of  the  survey  measures  participants'  self-rated  competence  in  using  digital media,  covering  areas  like  information  search,  device  handling,  critical  evaluation  of digital  content,  and  safe  internet  use.  Respondents  rate  their  skills  on  a  scale  from  1  (very low)  to  5  (very  high).  The  results  help  assess  whether  their  digital  literacy  is  sufficient for  engaging  with  e-participation  initiatives  and  may  uncover  correlations  between  their digital  skills  and  their  views  on  the  factors  influencing  trust  in  e-participation  (Fig.  6).

Fig.  6. Self-assessment  of  digital  media  competencies  by  respondents.

<!-- image -->

The  survey  results  show  that  most  participants  positively  assess  their  digital  media competencies.  A  total  of  38.89%  (84  people)  rated  their  skills  as high  (level 4),  and 18.98%  (41  people)  rated them  as very high (level 5).  Another  20.37%  (44  people) considered  their  skills  average  (level  3),  while  17.59%  (38  people)  rated  their  competence as  low  (level  2),  and  4.17%  (9  people)  rated  it  as  very  low  (level  1).  The  mean  score  of  3.51 (standard  deviation:  1.11)  indicates  that  digital  literacy  is  slightly  above  average  overall. Nearly  58%  of  respondents  rated  their  competence  as  high  (levels  4  or  5),  indicating they  are  well  equipped  to  participate  in  e-participation  initiatives.  However,  nearly  22% of  respondents  rated  their  skills  as  low  (levels  1  and  2),  suggesting  that  this  group  may need  additional  support,  such  as  more  user-friendly  interfaces  and  clearer  instructions. Age  differences  are  notable:  67.89%  of  respondents  under  45  rated  their  skills  as  high  or very  high,  while  50%  of  those  45  and  older  reported  low  or  very  low  skills.  This  indicates that  younger  individuals  are  more  confident  with  digital  tools,  while  older  users  may need  more  support  to  engage  effectively  with  e-participation.

Question  13  of  the  survey  assessed  citizens'  trust  in  their  local  government,  which plays  a  key  role  in  the  adoption  of  e-participation  applications.  The  results  show  a  moderate  level  of  trust.  While  43.52%  (94  people)  rated  their  trust  as  high  (level  4),  31.02%  (67 people)  gave  a  neutral  response  (level  3).  Only  9.26%  (20  people)  expressed  very  strong trust  (level  5).  Also,  12.5%  (27  people)  rated  their  trust  as  low  (level  2),  and  3.7%  (8 people)  reported  no  trust  (level  1).  The  average  trust  score  was  3.42  (standard  deviation: 0.95),  indicating  a  slightly  above-average  level  of  trust  but  with  diverse  opinions.  This suggests  that  while  many  citizens  trust  their  local  government,  there  is  still  skepticism

with  some  of  them,  which  may  influence  their  willingness  to  engage  in  e-participation initiatives.  Strengthening  trust  can  encourage  more  citizens  to  participate.

## 5 Discussion  of  Findings  and  Limitations  of  the  Research

The  survey  results  provide  valuable  insights  into  the  knowledge  and  attitudes  of  citizens in  the  metropolitan  region  of  Koblenz  toward  e-participation.  These  contribute  to  answer the five central program  questions  of the survey. The  analysis of questions 1 and 2 reveals that  general  knowledge  of  e-participation  is  limited.  While  the  basic  level  of e-participation, e-information, is recognized, there is a lack of  awareness regarding more  interactive  levels  of  participation,  such  as  e-consultation  and  e-collaboration.  This highlights the need for increased efforts to raise  awareness  and  understanding  of  eparticipation.  Questions  3  to  5  demonstrate  that  many  citizens  are  either  unaware  of  local online  participation  opportunities  or  do  not  utilize  them.  Usage  is  typically  confined  to passive  information  offerings,  with  interactive  participation  forms  being  less  well  known. This  indicates  the  potential  for  more  targeted  information  about  local  e-participation opportunities.

Questions  6  and  7  identified  key  technical  and  organizational  factors  that  enhance trust in e-participation applications, particularly data protection, IT security, transparency,  and  anonymity.  Additionally,  the  political  effectiveness  of  participation  was viewed  as  crucial,  as  citizens  are  more  motivated  when  their  participation  has  tangible  influence  on  decisions.  These  findings  underscore  the  importance  of  ensuring  that e-participation  initiatives  are  secure  and  transparent.  Questions  9  and  10  highlight  that insufficient  IT  security,  lack  of  data  protection,  and  opacity  significantly  undermine  trust. In  particular,  the  absence  of  clear  political  impact  and  inadequate  data  protection  lead to  mistrust.  These  factors  emphasize  the  importance  of  safeguarding  data  and  ensuring transparency  for  fostering  acceptance.

Further  factors  were  identified  in  open  questions  q8  and  q11.  Positive  influences include  personal  benefits,  trust  in  institutions,  and  a  desire  for  more  information  and involvement,  while  negative  factors  include  personal  disadvantages,  mistrust  of  institutions,  and  insufficient  information.  These  results  suggest  that,  alongside  technical  and legal  aspects,  the  personal  relevance  and  credibility  of  institutions  play  a  critical  role.

The  factors  identified  in  literature  in  Sect.  2  were  largely  confirmed  by  the  survey. The  findings  also  confirm  that  well-established  factors  such  as  trust,  user-friendliness, and  transparency  continue  to  significantly  influence  awareness  and  engagement  in  eparticipation  initiatives.  However,  the  empirical  survey  primarily  serves  as  a  snapshot of  awareness  and  benefits  regarding  e-participation  in  the  metropolitan  region.  Since  we did  not  explore  potential  solutions,  no  concrete  recommendations  can  be  made  here.

## 6 Conclusion

This study examined  the awareness  and benefits of e-participation initiatives in the metropolitan  area  of  Koblenz,  Germany.  First,  the  concept  of  e-participation  was  introduced,  and  relevant  factors  influencing  the  awareness,  trust  and  benefits  of  such  initiatives

were  explored  through  a  review  of  scientific  literature.  Factors  such  as  trust  in  participation  platforms,  trust  in  institutions,  transparency,  user-friendliness,  and  digital  skills were  identified.  Empirical  research  using  a  questionnaire,  which  was  distributed  in  the city  and  five  administrative  districts  within  the  metropolitan  area  of  Koblenz,  revealed insights  into  the  perception  and  positive  or  negative  influence  of  relevant  trust  factors. A  total  of  217  respondents  completed  the  questionnaire.  The  survey  aimed  to  assess  the actual  awareness  of  the  term  'e-participation'  and  the  utilization  of  related  offerings  in the  region.  The  findings  largely  confirmed  the  factors  identified  in  the  literature  review, with  additional  insights  emerging,  such  as  the  importance  of  increasing  awareness  and promoting  the  use  of  e-participation  applications.  However,  this  also  means  that  greater focus  needs  to  be  put  on  raising  awareness  of  the  benefits  of  participation  opportunities  in  policy-making  [37].  Different  stakeholder  groups  have  different  requirements  for participation  offerings,  and  these  must  be  considered  in  their  design  and  dissemination [38].

Further  exploration  of  the  findings  in  future  studies  would  benefit  from  an  examination  of  factors  influencing  the  use  of  both  e-participation  initiatives  and  trust  in  egovernment  service  provisioning.  For  example,  future  studies  could  explore  similarities and  differences  in  awareness,  perceived  benefits,  and  trust  in  institutions.  The  literature review  could  also  be  expanded  to  include  a  broader  range  of  influencing  factors  related to  e-participation,  covering  as  many  relevant  aspects  as  possible.  These  factors  could then  be  incorporated  into  future  empirical  research.  Since  the  data  was  primarily  collected  through  quantitative  methods,  deeper  understanding  regarding  the  reasons  why e-participation  offerings  are  often  unknown  or  underused  should  complement  the  quantitative  study.  To  address  this  gap,  additional  qualitative  interviews  should  be  conducted in  the  region  based  on  the  results  of  this  study.  This  would  allow  more  precise  criteria for  awareness  and  usefulness  to  be  identified,  including  those  from  different  cities  and regions,  as  well  as  best  practices.  On  this  basis,  it  would  then  be  possible  to  develop  a framework  for  enhancing  the  visibility  and  effectiveness  of  participation  opportunities (physical,  digital  and  hybrid).

Abstract. Social media has become a central platform for political communication, enabling parties to engage directly with voters, influence public discourse, and mobilize support. This study examines the relationship between political topics and user engagement on Instagram during the 2024 state elections in Germany. Applying a quantitative content analysis, we systematically analyzed posts from 41 official party and candidate accounts using a hierarchical topic classification model. Engagement metrics, including likes and comments, were analyzed to assess how different political topics, visual elements, and textual features influence interaction rates. Our findings reveal that emotionally charged content, particularly on topics such as immigration policy, security issues, and climate change, generated higher engagement levels compared to neutral policy discussions. Visual elements played a crucial role, with posts featuring human faces receiving significantly more likes than those without. Platform-specific dynamics influenced engagement, with Instagram favoring visually driven narratives and key textual elements embedded within images. The study also highlights platform-specific dynamics that shape political communication on Instagram, revealing structural patterns in content creation and interaction. By providing empirical insights into the effectiveness of political topics in driving engagement, this research contributes to the field of e-democracy and offers practical implications for campaign strategists aiming to optimize digital outreach.

## 1 Introduction

Social media has transformed political communication, enabling parties to interact directly with their audiences, receive feedback, and disseminate campaign messages. In Germany, where voter turnout and political engagement have fluctuated over the years [ 11], social media has become a critical success factor for parties aiming to connect with voters in an increasingly digitalized landscape

IFIP  International  Federation  for  Information  Processing  2026

[ 21]. Instagram has gained increasing relevance in social and political communication. As of 2024, 31% of Germans actively use the platform, while the share of Germans consuming political news via social media has risen from 18% in 2013 to 34% [ 13]. This underscores Instagram's rising influence, among younger voters, a demographic often underrepresented in traditional campaign strategies [ 12]. During elections, digital platforms shape public discourse and provide lowcost opportunities for visibility among the electorate and fundraising [ 8]. Given the growing reliance on social media as a primary source of news and political information, political parties must carefully select and frame their content to maximize engagement and mobilization [ 13]. Existing research has examined the role of social media in shaping political discourse, particularly its influence on voter mobilization and campaign strategies [ 20]. Studies indicate that thematic focus significantly influences engagement. Right-wing populist parties, such as the AfD, effectively leverage divisive issues, particularly Euroscepticism and antiimmigration narratives, to maximize online interaction [ 18]. Similarly, emotionally charged content, including negative portrayals of political opponents and crisis-driven messaging, tends to generate higher engagement than neutral policy discussions [ 7]. Additionally, prior research has explored platform-specific engagement behaviors, demonstrating how organizations adapt content strategies to leverage platform-native features [ 19]. However, the dynamics of social media engagement are evolving. Changes in media consumption habits, evolving platform algorithms, and stricter content moderation policies have altered the dynamics of media [ 13]. While earlier studies established that emotionally charged content drives engagement, recent findings suggest that audience fatigue from repetitive negative messaging may reduce its long-term effectiveness [ 9]. While research in marketing and influencer communication has provided valuable insights into social media engagement strategies [ 9], yet their applicability to political communication in electoral contexts remains underexplored. Despite these advancements, a critical gap remains in identifying which political topics drive the highest engagement across different social media platforms. In particular, Instagram remains understudied in the field of political communication [ 16]. To address this gap, this study investigates which political topics are most effective in driving social media engagement for German political parties. This question is explored by analyzing Instagram posts from German political parties in the three months leading up to the 2024 state elections in Saxony, Thuringia, and Brandenburg. Posts are systematically categorized based on their primary topics and engagement metrics, including likes and comments, are evaluated. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of political communication in the digital sphere and provides practical insights for campaign strategists and researchers. By analyzing the interplay between content topics, engagement patterns, and platform-specific characteristics, the findings offer data-driven insights for optimizing social media strategies in political campaigns.

## 2 Research  Background

The digitization of political communication has reshaped the electoral landscape, positioning social media as a crucial tool for shaping public opinion and mobilizing voters. Political parties increasingly utilize platforms such as Facebook, X (previously known as Twitter), Instagram, and YouTube to engage with their constituencies, bypass traditional media gatekeepers, and disseminate tailored campaign messages. This shift has facilitated more interactive, transparent, and personalized political communication, particularly among younger and more digitally active demographics [ 20]. Research has shown that social media fosters political engagement among young voters by providing a platform that aligns with their digital habits and allows for interactive participation [ 6]. While the accessibility and reach of social media offer significant advantages to political actors, the question of which topics generate the highest engagement remains underexplored [ 20].

Empirical studies highlight that engagement levels on social media are influenced by multiple factors, which can be broadly categorized into creator-related, contextual, and content-specific features [ 9]. Among these, content characteristics, particularly emotional intensity and controversy texts, have been shown to drive higher engagement [ 7]. Topics that evoke strong emotional reactions, such as immigration policy, security issues, and climate change, are more likely to generate discussion and interaction [ 23]. Political parties strategically frame their content to leverage these dynamics. For instance, the AfD has effectively leveraged social media by emphasizing controversial issues such as anti-immigration and Euroscepticism, outperforming other parties in terms of likes, comments, and shares [ 18]. Furthermore, studies indicate that the salience of a topic strongly influences its engagement potential, as content related to economic policy and administrative issues tends to receive significantly lower interaction rates in comparison to more emotionally charged topics [ 18].

Beyond thematic considerations, visual and textual elements further contribute to engagement outcomes. Bakhshi, Shamma, and Gilbert [ 2] have found that posts featuring human faces receive 38% more likes than those without, while content that incorporates textual elements, such as quotes and infographics, can enhance interaction rates. The format and structure of content also play a role in its effectiveness. Simplified, high-contrast images and positive emotional framing have been shown to increase engagement, particularly on visually oriented platforms such as Instagram [ 9]. These insights suggest that engagement is not solely determined by topic selection but also by how political content is visually and textually presented. Platform-specific dynamics further shape engagement levels, as each social media platform rewards different types of content. X, for example, serves as a space for real-time discussions, making it particu-

larly effective for political debates and immediate reactions to current events. Facebook, in contrast, supports long-form discussions and community-building, making it an ideal medium for in-depth policy communication [ 4]. Instagram prioritizes visually driven narratives over text-heavy discourse [ 16]. The posts typically feature an image that contains key textual elements, while additional details are provided in the caption. Since the platform is highly visual, the most critical information is embedded within the image itself to attract attention. [ 21]. YouTube, by contrast, primarily accommodates long-form political speeches and campaign videos, which typically generate lower interaction rates compared to platform-specific viral content [ 18]. Given these distinct engagement mechanisms, political actors must tailor their content strategies to the affordances of each platform to maximize interaction with voters. Audience segmentation further contributes to variations in engagement levels, as demographic factors influence users' interaction patterns with political content. Studies indicate that younger voters, particularly those under the age of 35, engage more frequently with political content on social media due to the interactive and participatory nature of these platforms [ 12]. Politically engaged users are also more likely to interact with highly polarized content, contributing to ideological reinforcement and the formation of echo chambers [ 18]. Differences in engagement behavior have also been observed across demographic groups, with younger users responding more favorably to visually engaging content, particularly on platforms such as Instagram, where aesthetic appeal plays a crucial role in interaction rates [ 9]. By contrast, older users are more likely to engage with policy-driven discussions that provide substantive political analysis, favoring platforms such as Facebook, where long-form content fosters deeper engagement with complex topics [ 12]. These findings highlight the importance of understanding how different audience segments interact with political content and tailoring engagement strategies accordingly. While social media facilitates greater voter engagement, it also presents challenges that may limit its effectiveness as a political communication tool. Not all topics perform equally well in generating interaction, with issues such as security and climate policy consistently attracting higher engagement, while topics such as education policy and agricultural reform often fail to elicit significant public response [ 20]. Moreover, the capacity of social media to amplify political messaging is accompanied by risks related to disinformation, echo chambers, and automated accounts, all of which can distort democratic discourse [ 18]. Another challenge is the saturation effect in digital engagement strategies. Research suggests that while emotionally charged content initially generates high interaction rates, repeated exposure to similar engagement tactics can lead to audience fatigue, ultimately diminishing their effectiveness over time [ 9]. This highlights the need for a balanced approach in political social media strategies, where emotionally compelling narratives are complemented by substantive political messaging to maintain sustained voter interest.

## 3 Research  Method

This study employs the Social media analytics framework in political context proposed by Stieglitz and Dang-Xuan (2013) [ 20] to systematically analyze political communication on social media. This framework provides a structured yet exploratory approach to identifying engagement patterns, combining topic and trend-engagement analysis with content, image, and network metadata analysis. By focusing on emerging political topics and engagement patterns, this study aims to develop a comprehensive understanding of the discourse driving social media interactions in Germany.

## 3.1 Data  Collection  and  Scope

The analysis focuses on the six major political parties that received the highest vote shares in the 2024 German state elections in Thuringia, Brandenburg, and Saxony. These parties have been characterized by Serrano et al. (2019) [ 18] as follows: The AfD (right-wing populist, anti-immigration), CDU (Christian conservative), Die Grünen (green party), Die Linke (socialist left), SPD (socialdemocratic), and BSW (new left-wing populist party) [ 22]. To ensure a comprehensive dataset, three types of Instagram accounts were included: (1) National party accounts (6 accounts, one per party), (2) State party accounts (18 accounts, one per party per state), and (3) Lead candidates' accounts (17 accounts, with one exclusion due to the absence of an Instagram account). In total, 41 Instagram accounts were analyzed. Content that exclusively reposted material from other accounts or contained duplicate posts was excluded to ensure unique data representation. The dataset includes textual and visual data (excluding videos), allowing for an in-depth analysis of engagement trends. The timeframe covers the period from June 1st to October 1st, 2024, capturing political communication during the peak election campaign period. This includes candidate announcements, major debates, party rallies, and voter mobilization efforts, all of which significantly influence engagement levels.

## 3.2 Engagement  Measurement  and  Data  Processing

Engagement was measured as the sum of likes and comments per post, representing active user interactions with content. While shares and reposts could have provided additional insights, they were inaccessible due to Instagram's API restrictions. To mitigate potential distortions in engagement metrics, average engagement was also calculated. This aligns with prior research, which highlights that summing likes and comments might not be the most accurate proxy for engagement, as the ratio and weight between these metrics are unbalanced [ 9]. Future studies should explore alternative measures for engagement that better capture audience interaction [ 9]. Data was collected using Apify Instagram Scraper [ 1], extracting the following key features:

- -Post  content : alt-text (alternative text used for accessibility) and captions

- -Engagement  metrics : number of comments and likes
- -Post  metadata : timestamp, content type, URL, and sponsorship status
- -Owner  information :account username, full name, and profile type
- -Media  features : detected objects and embedded text in images

To ensure data consistency, all textual data was preprocessed using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) [ 3], a suite of libraries and tools for symbolic and statistical natural language processing, and Scikit-learn [ 14], a Python library for machine learning. The steps included:

- -Cleaning  and  filtering : Removing irrelevant terms (e.g., dates, politician and party names) to prevent bias in topic classification.
- -Stop-word  removal : Eliminating standard and German-specific stop words.
- -Tokenization : Splitting text into individual words.
- -Text-image  integration : Merging detected text from images with captions for a holistic content representation.

## 3.3 Topic  Classification  and  Engagement  Analysis

To determine which political topics drive engagement, a topic-based analysis approach was applied, integrating dictionary-based keyword matching with statistical text analysis methods. A Political Topic Dictionary was developed by combining dictionaries from the Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung (bpb) [ 5] to categorize posts. This dictionary was structured hierarchically, consisting of 13 superordinate topics and corresponding subordinate topics to allow for granular classification of political content. The superordinate categories included: Security Policy, Party Politics (including election topics), Social Policy, Environmental and Climate Policy, Financial and Tax Policy, Foreign Policy, Economic Policy, Government Policy, Digitalization and Technology Policy, Regional Policy, Education and Science Policy, Cultural and Media Policy, Agricultural Policy, Transport and Infrastructure Policy, an 'Uncategorized' group for unmatched posts. The dictionary-based classification process matched extracted keywords from the posts against dictionary terms. For example, posts mentioning 'climate change' were categorized under 'Environmental and Climate Policy,' while those with terms like 'tax reduction' were assigned to 'Financial and Tax Policy.' To improve accuracy, Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) [ 17] measured word relevance, and stemming via the Snowball algorithm [ 15] standardized word forms. Each post was assigned a dominant superordinate topic, ensuring multi-topic posts were classified under their primary theme. Engagement metrics (likes and comments) were then linked to these categories, enabling a quantitative analysis of voter engagement trends across different policy areas. This method highlights which political issues resonate most on social media platforms.

## 4 Results

This section presents the findings of the study on social media engagement patterns of German political parties during the 2024 state elections in Saxony, Thuringia, and Brandenburg. Using data from Instagram, the analysis categorized content by political topics and engagement metrics such as post frequency, likes, and comments. The results provide insights into the effectiveness of various topics and strategies in engaging the electorate. The data reveals significant variation in the posting behavior of political parties. The CDU was the most active, with 816 posts, followed by the AfD and SPD, which posted 525 and 474 times, respectively. On the other hand, BSW and Die Grünen were less active, contributing 240 and 253 posts, respectively. These results suggest differences in communication strategies, with the CDU emphasizing frequent content delivery to dominate the online discourse(Fig.1)..

| Uncategorized                            | 19,43% | 11,25% | 17,52% | 20,16%  | 27,60%  | 19,83% | 19,43%  |

The analysis of topic-specific engagement revealed distinct patterns: The most frequently posted topics include Party Policy (444 posts, including election policy), Security Policy (353 posts), and Social Policy (332 posts), which have the highest number of posts among all categorized policy areas. Additionally, Regional Policy (230 posts) and Environmental and Climate Policy (170 posts) also received a notable amount of attention, indicating a moderate level of discussion. In contrast, the least posted topics include Foreign Policy (68 posts) and Government Policy (64 posts), followed by Cultural and Media Policy (23 posts), Agricultural Policy (19 posts), and Transportation and Infrastructure Policy (7 posts). These topics have the lowest representation in the dataset, with significantly fewer posts compared to the top-ranked categories.

Approximately 19% of the posts were classified as uncategorized, indicating gaps in content alignment with predefined thematic dictionary. These included generic posts such as birthday wishes, announcements or updates that lacked clear political context. The analysis of engagement across different account types reveals notable variations in posting activity. State accounts were the most active, contributing a total of 1,411 posts, highlighting their crucial role in state-level political communication during election campaigns. Lead candidate accounts followed with 810 posts, emphasizing a more personalized approach aimed at fostering direct connections with voters. In contrast, federal government accounts were the least active, with 471 posts, primarily focusing on overarching campaign themes rather than frequent engagement. However, it is important to consider that the dataset includes three state accounts per party, compared to only one federal government account per party. This structural difference in account representation naturally influences the overall post volume, as statelevel communication benefits from a higher number of contributing accounts, which should be taken into account when interpreting the results. The number of subscribers varies significantly among political parties, reflecting differences in audience reach and online presence. The AfD has the highest number of subscribers, with 404,411, followed by the Grüne with 316,578 and Linke with 250,560. The CDU ranks fourth with 220,631 subscribers, while the SPD has a notably lower count at 156,945. The BSW has the smallest subscriber base among the listed parties, with 60,968. This distribution shows a clear variation in audience reach across the parties, with the AfD having more than double the number of subscribers compared to the SPD and significantly more than the BSW. The CDU, SPD, and BSW trailed significantly, indicating differing levels of reach and influence.

Similarly, Fig. 3 highlights that topics with high like counts also tend to receive a greater number of comments. Security Policy, Foreign Policy, and Financial and Tax Policy attract the most discussions, while Agricultural Policy and Cultural and Media Policy see minimal interaction. This correlation suggests that highly liked topics are also those that provoke discussion and user engagement. An analysis was conducted to assess how the presence of text and persons in images affects social media engagement. The results indicate substantial differences in engagement metrics across different image types. Images containing only text recorded the highest interaction levels, with an average of 1,503.91 likes and 76.93 comments per post. This suggests that text-based visuals play a significant role in drawing user engagement. Images featuring both text and persons followed closely, averaging 1,106.76 likes and 62.72 comments, making this the most frequently used format in the dataset. In contrast, images containing only persons had lower engagement levels (902.82 likes, 56.32 comments), but still performed significantly better than images without text or persons (299.89 likes, 6.00 comments). Distinct topic preferences among German political parties

reflected their ideologies and strategic priorities. The AfD emphasized Security and Foreign Policy, aligning with its anti-immigration stance and leveraging public anxieties. Die Grünen focused on Environmental Policy but also engaged strongly in Economic and Foreign Policy, likely due to ministerial roles. The CDU targeted Party, Regional, and Social Policy to appeal broadly, while the SPD balanced Social, Party, and Security Policy but underperformed in engagement despite leading the government. Die Linke prioritized Social and Education Policy, resonating with their base, while the newer BSW concentrated on Party and Financial Policy to establish their identity. The analysis underscores the importance of tailoring content to voter interests. Topics such as Security Policy and Social Policy demonstrated strong engagement potential, while less prominent areas, including Education and Agricultural Policy, suggest room for improvement in communication strategies. The findings also highlight significant differences in posting behavior and topic prioritization across parties, offering valuable insights into the evolving landscape of political communication in the digital age.

## 5 Discussion

The findings of this study provide valuable insights into the dynamics of social media engagement in the context of German state elections. By analyzing Instagram content from 41 political accounts, we identified patterns in audience interactions and assessed the effectiveness of various political topics in generating engagement. This section discusses the implications of the results, methodological limitations, and potential directions for future research.

## 5.1 Implications  of  Findings

Previous research suggests that emotionally charged and polarizing topics drive higher engagement on social media, particularly for populist parties like the AfD, which strategically employ divisive narratives such as Euroscepticism and anti-immigration discourse to mobilize support [ 18]. Our results confirm this, as foreign policy, security policy, and government policy emerged as the most engaging topics across parties, reinforcing the notion that voters are more likely to interact with issues that evoke strong emotions or directly impact their lives.

Prior studies have highlighted that economic topics generally receive lower engagement compared to security and migration-related issues [ 18]. Our results extend this finding by revealing that economic policy discussions generated moderate engagement, suggesting that while economic stability remains a public concern, it lacks the emotional immediacy of security-related discussions. However, economic topics saw higher engagement when framed around taxation and financial policies, indicating that specific economic subtopics resonate more strongly with voters. A novel contribution of this study is the differential engagement patterns observed across policy areas. While previous research noted that education and agriculture often receive lower interaction rates [ 20], our findings

provide further granularity. Environmental and climate policy received significantly higher engagement than education and agriculture, suggesting a growing public interest in sustainability issues. Regional and social policies also generated notable engagement, indicating that voters are drawn to topics that have a direct, tangible impact on their communities. Cultural and media policy, as well as transportation and infrastructure, saw the lowest engagement, reinforcing past findings that not all policy areas attract equal attention on social media. Thus, highlighting the challenge of promoting lower-engagement topics in digital political campaigns.

Instagram's engagement model prioritizes visually compelling and concise content, with text embedded in images emerging as the strongest driver of engagement. While prior research found that posts featuring human faces receive 38% more likes than those without [ 2], our findings reveal that political posts with embedded text consistently outperformed those with a person in the image. Further, the combination of embedded text and a person in the image outperformed general images without both types of elements. This suggests that in the political context, text integration, e.g. slogans within images enhances audience interaction, making it a more effective engagement tool than facial imagery alone. These results align with research indicating that Instagram users respond favorably to visually embedded information rather than relying solely on captions [ 21]. Furthermore, content with an emotional framing proved more effective than neutral policy discussions. Previous research indicates that negatively framed messages drive higher engagement [ 7], a trend that our findings confirm. Posts highlighting crises, conflicts, or pressing issues received the most interaction, whereas neutral policy explanations failed to generate comparable levels of engagement. Normalizing engagement by follower count revealed nuanced insights. While the AfD's raw engagement in their key topics was high, normalization suggested the influence of their large follower base. Conversely, smaller parties like the Grüne and BSW showed higher normalized engagement in their respective focus areas, demonstrating strong resonance within their core audiences. This highlights the importance of considering follower count for accurate engagement interpretation.

## 5.2 Methodological  Limitations

While the social media analytics framework provided a structured and systematic approach to our analysis, several methodological limitations should be acknowledged. First, the coverage of the Political Topic Dictionary was limited. Approximately 80% of the analyzed posts could be categorized based on the predefined keyword set, leaving 20% of the content uncategorized. The implementation of stemming, along with keyword optimization and the removal of irrelevant terms, significantly enhanced the classification process, reducing the proportion of uncategorized posts from an initial 48% to 36% with stemming alone and further to 20% after keyword refinement. However, many of the remaining uncategorized posts were generic or lacked a clear thematic context. For instance, posts such as congratulation wishes or natural landscape images of a location

illustrate content that, while relevant for engagement, cannot be directly associated with a political topic. This underscores the need for improved keyword mapping and contextual analysis to enhance classification accuracy. Second, the study exhibits platform-specific bias, as the analysis was restricted to Instagram. The dynamics of political communication vary across platforms, such as Facebook and X, which attract different demographic segments and foster distinct interaction patterns. A cross-platform analysis would be necessary to provide a more comprehensive understanding of digital political engagement across different digital ecosystems. Third, the study's temporal scope was limited to the four-month period between June 1st and October 1st. While this timeframe was sufficient to capture election-related topic trends, it does not allow for an examination of longer-term engagement patterns, such as shifts in audience behavior outside the immediate electoral cycle. Extending the analysis beyond this period could offer deeper insights into shifts in engagement over time. Another limitation pertains to the influence of bots on engagement metrics. Since bot detection was not part of the preprocessing workflow, it was not possible to systematically identify and exclude automated accounts or coordinated campaigns from the dataset. As a result, engagement metrics may have been artificially inflated, potentially distorting the analysis. This issue is particularly relevant for parties with high online mobilization efforts, where engagement metrics may not solely reflect organic interactions. Furthermore, the study did not account for indirect social media amplification, such as content resharing by influential users or broader online discussions. Consequently, the full extent of content virality and its impact on political discourse remains unexplored. While prior research suggests that younger audiences engage more frequently with visually compelling and emotionally framed content, whereas older demographics prefer policy-driven discussions with substantive analysis [ 12], our study does not differentiate engagement patterns by age group. Without user-specific data, it is difficult to determine whether engagement trends are driven by specific voter demographics or broader content appeal. These limitations highlight avenues for future research, including improved keyword classification, cross-platform analyses, extended temporal studies, bot detection, and audience segmentation, to deepen the understanding of digital political engagement.

## 5.3 Future  Research  Directions

Future research should refine the understanding of social media engagement in political communication by exploring key areas. Expanding keyword dictionaries could enhance topic classification accuracy, especially for complex narratives. Cross-platform comparisons would offer insights into engagement dynamics across Facebook, X, and TikTok, considering their unique demographics, content formats, and algorithms. Analyzing these variations would clarify which political topics and strategies are most effective in different digital ecosystems.

Additionally, sentiment analysis, longitudinal studies, and network amplification analysis could further enhance the understanding of political engagement on social media. Sentiment analysis would clarify whether engagement reflects

support, criticism, or polarization, providing deeper insights beyond quantitative metrics such as likes and comments [ 7]. Longitudinal studies tracking engagement trends across multiple election cycles can provide valuable insights into how voter interactions evolve over time, revealing whether specific topics consistently drive engagement or fluctuate [ 10]. Lastly, network amplification analysis would examine how political content spreads beyond initial interactions, distinguishing between organic reach and coordinated digital mobilization through mechanisms such as resharing, influencer reposts, and automated accounts [ 18].

Addressing these research areas can deepen our understanding of political engagement on social media and yield insights of theoretical and practical value for digital campaign strategies.

## 6 Conclusion  and  Outlook

This study examined the effectiveness of different political topics in driving engagement on Instagram during the 2024 German state elections, providing new insights into topic selection, platform-specific engagement, and audience interaction patterns. By analyzing the content strategies of six major political parties, the findings confirm that emotionally charged and policy-relevant topics, such as security and government policy, drive the highest engagement, while issues like education, culture, and infrastructure receive comparatively lower interaction. Furthermore, the study highlights the critical role of text-embedded visuals, which emerged as the most effective engagement enabler, reinforcing prior research on Instagram's preference for visually compelling content.

Beyond topic effectiveness, the study underscores the importance of platformspecific adaptation. Political actors must tailor their content strategies to align with Instagram's engagement dynamics, prioritizing concise messaging, highimpact visuals, and emotionally resonant narratives. Despite these insights, several open questions remain. The study did not account for demographic segmentation in engagement behavior, limiting the ability to determine whether certain topics resonate differently across age groups or voter ideologies. Additionally, longitudinal trends in engagement could not be analyzed, making it unclear whether certain topics maintain their influence over multiple election cycles or if political engagement on social media is highly event-driven. Moreover, cross-platform comparisons were beyond the study's scope, leaving open the question of how engagement patterns differ on Facebook, X, or TikTok, where user behaviors and content formats vary significantly. Looking forward, future research should address these gaps by incorporating demographic insights, expanding the analysis to additional platforms, and tracking engagement patterns over multiple election cycles. Additionally, integrating sentiment analysis and network amplification studies could provide a more comprehensive view of public reactions and content spread in digital political communication. As social media continues to shape electoral strategies, understanding how to optimize engagement through topic selection and content presentation will be crucial for political actors aiming to connect effectively with voters in the digital age.

Abstract. The  rise  of  generative  artificial  intelligence  (GenAI)  is  bringing  in  a new  era of technological  advancement  in  the  public sector, with sophisticated GenAI  tools  now  readily  accessible  to  all  public  servants  for  a  wide  array  of  applications.  Public  servants  use  GenAI  tools  to  draft  reports,  refine  policy  proposals and  generate  content,  often  without  explicit  approval  or  institutional  policies  governing  their  use.  This  informal  and  independent  adoption  of  AI,  which  is  referred to  as  the  'shadow  use'  of  GenAI,  represents  a  significant  but  largely  unregulated shift  in  how  AI  is  integrated  into  public-sector  work.  While  the  benefits  are  substantial,  the  challenges  are  equally  significant.  The  literature  on  this  topic  is  still in  its  early  stages,  emphasising  the  need  to  clearly  define  the  research  area,  outline the  main  characteristics  of  the  phenomenon  and  establish  terminology  relevant  to the  current  debate,  particularly  concerning  the  unique  features  that  GenAI  introduces  to  the  public  sector.  This  study  addresses  this  gap  by  surveying  576  public managers  from  seven  EU  Member  States,  aiming  to  shed  light on the current state  of  practice  and  stimulate  discussion  about  the  ongoing  transformations.  It offers  insights  into  the  shifting  dynamics  and  emerging  perspectives  that  GenAI is  bringing  to  the  public  sector.

## 1 Introduction

Generative  artificial  intelligence  (GenAI)  is  now  readily  and  freely  accessible  online, enabling  anyone  with  internet  access  to  interact  with  tools  that  utilise  it.  Public  servants are  part  of  this  wave  of  enthusiasm  and  opportunity,  increasingly  experimenting  with GenAI  for  tasks  such  as  text  enhancement,  image  creation  and  information  retrieval [1,  2].  These  tools  offer  new  forms  of  interaction,  often  perceived  as  collaborative  or conversational,  that  are  different  from  those  offered  by  earlier  automation  technologies. Platforms  such  as  ChatGPT  introduce  novel  user  experiences  that  can  often  evoke  a sense  of  incredulity  and  amazement  similar  to  the  feeling  of  encountering  a  new  form of  intelligence  [3].

While  GenAI  continues  to  develop  in line with broader trends in AI and -  previously  -  digital  government,  it  also  presents  new  dynamics,  particularly  in  terms  of informal,  individual-driven  use.  In  some  cases,  public  administrations  are  piloting  or adopting  GenAI-based  applications,  such  as  Bürokratt  in Estonia and UrbanistAI  in Helsinki,  Finland  [4].  However,  many  public  servants  are  also  using  GenAI  tools  independently,  without  formal  institutional  frameworks,  oversight  or  guidance.  This  kind  of autonomous  and  often  undocumented  use-which  is  referred  to  as  the  'shadow  use'  of GenAI  [5]  -  is  already  widespread  and  raises  important  questions  for  public  administration.  In  this  paper,  we  focus  on  this  emerging  phenomenon.  Specifically,  we  explore how  public  managers  across  seven  EU  Member  States  engage  with  GenAI  in  practice, what  motivates  or  limits  its  use  and  what  this  means  for  governance,  capacity  building and  future  research.

The  literature  on  GenAI  in  public  administration  is  still  nascent,  with  rather  fragmented  and  scattered  research  [2].  Much  of  the  current  debate  is  primarily  risk  oriented, focusing  on  potential  misuse,  ethical  concerns  and  the  need  for  mitigation  measures, often  articulated  through  common-sense  guidelines  or  high-level  governance  principles [3].  While  these  concerns  are  valid,  the  discussion  tends  to  prioritise  formal  adoption and  top-down  control  mechanisms.  This  overlooks  how  GenAI  is  being  adopted  and implemented  into  public-administration  workflows.

As  Janssen  [6] notes, the  increasing  ease  of  AI  access  and  deployment  does  not automatically  translate  into  higher-quality  outcomes  or  alignment  with  public  values. The  more  accessible  these  tools  become,  the  greater  the  need  for  governance  frameworks that  ensure  their  responsible  use  while  addressing  unintended  consequences.  Rather  than assuming  that  accessibility  alone  drives  impact,  there  is  a  need  to  empirically  investigate how  GenAI  tools  are  being  used  in  real-world  administrative  contexts,  by  whom  and  for what  kinds  of  tasks.

This  paper  aims  to  contribute  to  that  effort  by  offering  insights  based  on  an  original dataset  on  the  use  of  GenAI  compiled  through  a  survey  of  576  public  managers  across seven  Member  States.  Through  an  exploratory  approach,  it  examines  the  current  landscape  of  GenAI  use  within  the  public  sector.  The  findings  offer  practical  evidence  to inform  future  governance  discussions  and  guide  future  research  in  this  area.

## 2 Generative  Artificial  Intelligence  and  Its  Use  in  the  Public  Sector

The  adoption  of  GenAI  in  public  administrations  has  accelerated  rapidly  [2].  The  broad online availability of tools such as ChatGPT  has  enabled  public  servants to  experiment  with  GenAI  directly,  without  relying  on  institutional  procurement  or  integration processes.  While  comprehensive  data  remain  limited,  initial  studies  suggest  growing engagement.  For  instance,  Apolitical  reported that,  by  September  2023,  more  than  50% of  the  public  servants  surveyed  had  used  GenAI  tools.  As  regards  the  Canadian  federal public  service,  one  study  found  that  11.2%  of  public  servants  had  applied  generative systems  for  work-related  purposes  [2].

What  distinguishes  GenAI  from  previous  waves  of  digital  innovation  is  not  only  its accessibility,  but  also  the  degree  of  autonomy  it  affords  to  users.  Traditional  technology implementation  in  government  typically  involves  managed  and  controlled  processes,

including  deployment  plans  and  integration  into  existing  systems  as  part  of  a  digital transformation  strategy  [7].  However,  GenAI  can  be  adopted  informally,  without  topdown  approval,  training  or  oversight.  This  contrasts  with  many  technologies,  especially other  AI  solutions,  that  remain  confined  to  pilot  phases  due  to  complexity,  cost  or  risk aversion  [8].

GenAI  bypasses  many  of  these  barriers,  as  it  is  founded  on  individualised  and  independent  integration  into  workloads,  which  can  vary  even  among  individuals  with  identical  responsibilities  [3].  Therefore,  the  potentially  large  breadth  of  public-servant  users and  the  simplicity  of  deployment  make  the  use  of  GenAI  by  administrations  distinctly different  from  the  use  of  earlier  technologies.

On  the  other  hand,  this  new  approach  to  technology  introduces  challenges  in  tracking and  managing  its  use  by  public  servants.  Since  individuals  can  easily  access  these  tools online  and  incorporate  them  into  daily  tasks,  such  as  drafting  emails,  revising  text  or answering  work-related  questions,  their  use  is  neither  embedded  in  nor  traceable  through formal  organisational  processes.  This  phenomenon  can  be  described  as  'shadow  use'  [5]. The  risk  with  this  type  of  use  is  that  it  can  easily  go  unnoticed  and  may  not  comply  with professional  guidelines  at  work  [2].  Moreover,  even  individuals  with  identical  roles  may adopt  GenAI  in  different  ways,  resulting  in  a  fragmented  usage  landscape  that  is  difficult to  track  and  monitor  effectively.

While  the  potential  benefits  of  GenAI  technology  are  often  emphasised,  scholars  and practitioners  have  also  begun  to  explore  its  possible  drawbacks.  Although  a  comprehensive  list  of  risks  has  yet  to  be  established,  several  recurring  concerns  are  emerging  in  the literature  [9].  Notably,  the  Council  of  the  European  Union  published  a  report  in  April 2023  [10]  outlining  the  key  risks  associated  with  the  use  of  GenAI  in  public  administration.  These  include  challenges  linked  to  accountability,  equality  and  impartiality, efficiency, data security, reliability, citizen involvement  and  trust, serving the public interest,  and  quality  [6].

Scholars  also  stress  data  leakage  as  a  persistent  concern,  because  most  of  these  tools are  managed  by  external  providers  that  often  give  unclear  information  about  how  user data  are  stored,  processed  or  reused  [9].  Public  administrations  must  navigate  the  tension between  the  commercial  opacity  of  GenAI  providers,  the  need  to  foster  innovation  and  the impossibility  of  fully  controlling  how  these  tools  are  used  across  organisations  [3].  Other frequently  cited  issues  include  hallucinations  and  bias,  especially  the  risk  of  over-reliance on  machine-generated  content  or  uncritical  acceptance  of  discriminatory  behaviours. The core concern  is not merely  the errors themselves, but also the  confidence with which  they  are  presented.  These  errors  challenge  the  mechanistic  view  of  machines,  as GenAI's  probabilistic  nature  does  not  produce  systematic  errors.  Consequently,  GenAI's errors,  akin  to  human  mistakes,  bring  it  closer  to  human-like  behaviour.  If  not  properly understood  and  managed,  this  characteristic  could  lead  to  inappropriate  and  potentially harmful  technology  use  [3].

These drawbacks  are amplified by the fact that GenAI  tools are often not used to  meet  operational  needs.  For  many  public  servants  involved  in  policy  formulation, communication  or  advisory  roles,  interacting  with  GenAI  is  less  about  task  automation and  more  about  cognitive  support  [3,  5].  In  this  context,  GenAI  becomes  embedded  in knowledge  work,  supporting  idea  generation,  drafting  and  reflection.

This  situation  represents  a  new  and  still  evolving  challenge  for  public  administrations,  governments  and  individual  public  servants.  The  widespread  yet  informal  nature  of GenAI  use  creates  a  context  marked  by  experimentation,  learning  by  doing  and  varying levels  of  institutional  oversight.  However,  this  does  not  preclude  public  administrations from  implementing  measures  to  guide  and  shape  the  fair  use  of  GenAI.  Training  sessions and  guidelines  are  already  being  established  to  facilitate  and  regulate  the  use  of  GenAI, aiming  to  enhance  efficiency  and  effectiveness  while  also  addressing  potential  risks  [5].

In  this  complex  and  evolving  landscape,  a  clear  narrative  has  yet  to  take  shape.  The existing  literature  remains  fragmented,  drawing  attention  to  various  technical,  ethical and  organisational  aspects,  but  offering  limited  insights  into  how  these  elements  interact in  practice.  Fundamental  questions  remain  open:  'What  is  currently  happening?',  'What are  the  implications?'  and  'How  do  we  tackle  them?'.  While  such  uncertainty  is  expected, given  the  novelty  of  the  technology,  there  is  a  clear  need  to  begin  systematically  framing the  discourse,  understanding  the  phenomenon  and  identifying  the  key  aspects  that  require further  exploration.

In  summary,  the  implications  of  GenAI  for  public  administrations  are  extensive  and far-reaching,  and  research  in  this  area  remains  limited.  In  particular,  the  independent  -  or shadow  -  use  of  GenAI  in  government  settings  opens  up  avenues  for  deeper  empirical and  conceptual  exploration.

## 3 Methodology

## 3.1 Sample  and  Data  Collection

We  conducted  a  cross-national  survey  to  explore  public  managers'  use  of  GenAI  tools. The  survey  was  part  of a  larger  survey  on  AI  adoption  [11].  The  survey  specifically targeted  individuals  holding  management  roles  within  local  or  national  governments, with  an  additional  screening  question  to  confirm  their  employment  in  the  public  sector.

To  ensure  a  broad  perspective,  we  purposely  selected  seven  Member  States,  namely Germany,  Spain,  France,  the  Netherlands,  Austria,  Poland  and  Sweden.  This  selection includes  both  larger  and  smaller  Member  States,  covering  diverse  geographical  regions within the EU  and  capturing  a  range  of administrative  traditions,  digital  governance maturity  levels  and  AI  adoption  trends  within  the  EU.

Data  collection  took  place  in  March  2024,  with  the  support  of  an  external  company (for  details,  please  refer  to  [11]).  The  survey  was  conducted  online.  Responses  were screened  for  completeness  to  ensure  data  quality.  Given  the  specific focus  on public managers,  the  survey  yielded  576  complete  responses,  including  53  from  Austria,  110 from  France,  112  from  Germany,  65  from  the  Netherlands,  64  from  Poland,  112  from Spain  and  60  from  Sweden.  The  dataset  has  been  published  as  open  data  in  the  Joint Research  Centre  data  catalogue.

Our  focus  on  the  EU  allowed  an  analysis  to  be  undertaken  within  the  context  of  a shared  regulatory  and  strategic  framework  [5].  Since  2021,  the  EU  has  prioritised  the integration  of  digital  technologies,  including  AI,  into  the  public  sector  [12].  The  recently adopted  AI  Actaims  to  establish  a  common  foundation  for  AI  governance  across  Member States,  emphasising  transparency,  explainability  and  fairness  while  addressing  potential risks. By concentrating on the EU, we aimed to explore the factors influencing  AI

adoption  within  a  structured  policy  environment,  enabling  a  more  nuanced  understanding of  adoption  dynamics.

## 3.2 Survey  Design  and  Analysis

The  survey  was  initially  developed  in  English  as  a  master  version.  To  ensure  linguistic accuracy  and  accessibility,  it  was  professionally  translated  into  the  local  languages  of the selected countries -Dutch, French, German,  Polish, Spanish  and Swedish  -  by the  Directorate-General  for  Translation.  In  addition,  researchers  with  native  proficiency reviewed  the  translations  to  refine  wording  and  address  any  ambiguities.

The  questionnaire  covered  key  aspects  of  AI  adoption  in  the  public  sector,  including awareness,  perceived  benefits  and  risks,  barriers  to  adoption,  and  actual  use  of  GenAI tools.  Moreover,  the  questionnaire  included  some  demographic  questions  on  the  individual  (e.g.  age  and  seniority)  and  questions  on  the  public  organisation  (e.g.  the  area  of the  public  sector  and  size  of  the  organisation)  The  survey  structure  and  the  distribution of  respondents  are  detailed  in  the  annex.

The  survey  was  designed  based  on  established  categorisations,  primarily  those  from the  European  Commission's  Public  Sector  Tech  Watch,  which  monitors  AI  adoption, including  GenAI,  across  EU  public  administrations.  More  information  about  the  methodology  for the survey  design  and the categories can be found  in the dedicated  report [13].

As  this  study  aims  to  initiate  discussion  rather  than  provide  a  comprehensive  quantitative  statistical  analysis,  the  results  section  focuses  on  descriptive  statistics  and  preliminary  trends.  This  approach  enables  an  initial  understanding  to  be  gained  of  the  patterns in  GenAI  adoption  among  public  managers.

## 4 Results

This  section  presents  the  descriptive  statistics  derived  from  the  survey.  Detailed  statistics for  each  question  are  available  in  the  annex,  and  the  corresponding  question  numbers  are given  in  brackets  in  the  text.  The  results  outlined  in  this  section  cross-analyse  responses to  illustrate  key  patterns  in  the  data.

## 4.1 Adoption  Trends

First  and  foremost,  this  exploratory  approach  aims  to  understand  the  extent  of  GenAI  use and  the  characteristics  of  its  users.  A  key  finding  from  the  survey  is  that  30%  of  public managers  actively  use  GenAI  in  their  daily  work  (Q3.2).  While  this  figure  is  considerable, it  is  equally  notable  that  a  further  44%  of  respondents  (255  out  of  576)  reported  plans to  adopt  these  tools  in  the  future.  This  indicates  that  adoption  is  already  under  way  and likely  to  expand  further  as  awareness  and  familiarity  with  these  technologies  increase.

An  analysis  by  age  group  (Q1.1)  reveals  a  clear  trend  in  anticipated  GenAI  adoption (Fig.  1).  As  expected,  younger  civil  servants  are  at  the  forefront;  however,  a  substantial share of respondents  across  other age brackets also express interest,  suggesting  that

Fig.  1. Use  (%)  of  GenAI  tools  for  work  by  age  group  ( n = 576)

<!-- image -->

GenAI adoption  in  the  public  sector  is  not  limited  to  the  youngest  cohort.  This  emphasises that  interest  in  GenAI  tools  spans  multiple  generations.

When  the  data  are  cross-referenced  with  the  public  manager's  awareness  of  GenAI tools  (Q3.1),  it  becomes  evident  that  those  who  do  not  use  the  tools  are  often  less  informed (Fig.  2).

<!-- image -->

Finally,  adoption  rates  vary  considerably  across  sectors  (Q2.1),  potentially  reflecting differences  in  operational  needs,  regulatory  constraints  and  levels  of  digital  readiness (Fig.  3).  The  data  show  that  certain  governmental  functions,  such  as  defence  and  economic  affairs,  already  report  comparatively  higher  adoption  rates  than  other  sectors.  In contrast,  sectors  such  as  education  and  housing  show  lower  current  usage,  although  a substantial  number  of  respondents  from  these  areas  indicated  a  strong  willingness  to adopt  GenAI  in  the  future.  However,  given  the  low  number  of  responses  in  some  sectors, further  research  is  needed  to  confirm  these  findings.

It  is  worth  noting  that  no  clear  differences  in  adoption  rates  were  observed  among government  levels  or  administration  sizes.

## 4.2 How  Public  Managers  Use  Generative  Artificial  Intelligence

An  intriguing  aspect  of  the  data  concerns  how  public  managers  access  GenAI  platforms (Q3.4).  Unsurprisingly,  most  report  using  freely  available  web-based  versions.  However, a  notable  proportion  use  internal  tools  provided  by  their  administration.  Further  research is  needed  to  better  understand  these  responses.  It  would  be  valuable  to  explore  what types  of  tools  administrations  are  providing,  whether  they  have  begun  integrating  GenAI through application programming  interfaces, whether they are paying for  employee subscriptions and whether there is confusion among  public managers  regarding the distinction  between  internal  and  publicly  accessible  tools.

When  examining  the  tasks  for  which  GenAI  is  used  (Q3.5),  the data reveal that GenAI  is  used  to  support  a  wide  range  of  activities  (Fig.  4).  A  considerable  share  of public  managers  reported  using  GenAI  for  most  of  the  tasks  listed  several  times  per week.  However,  a  notable  number  also  reported 'never' using  GenAI  for  each task. This  suggests  that  usage  varies  widely  and  may  depend  on  several  factors,  such  as  job responsibilities,  individual  skills  and  personal  preferences.  For  example,  depending  on a  manager's  writing  proficiency,  GenAI  may  be  used  regularly  for  text  enhancement  or not  at  all.

<!-- image -->

Regarding  the  perceived  benefits  among  current  users  (Q3.6),  the  data  clearly  show that  the  narrative  around  GenAI  extends  beyond  mere  efficiency  gains  (Fig.  5).  While efficiency  remains  one  of  the  most  frequently  cited  advantages,  many  public  managers also  recognise  GenAI's  potential  to  enhance  creativity  and  support  learning.  As  GenAI tools  are  still  emerging  and  not  yet  fully  integrated  into  most  public-sector  workflows, some  of  the  reported  benefits  may  be  based  on  first  impressions  rather  than  on  sustained use.  Nonetheless,  this  finding  highlights  a  growing  interest  in  how  GenAI  might  augment, not  just  automate,  human  capabilities.

## 4.3 Potential  Barriers  to  Adoption

The  primary  reason  cited  for  not  adopting  or  for  lacking  interest  in  adopting  GenAI  tools (Q3.3)  is  insufficient  knowledge  about  how  to  use  these  tools,  or  even  an  unawareness  of their  existence,  rather  than  data-sharing  concerns  or  a  lack  of  trust.  In  addition,  environmental  issues  are  considered  of  little  importance.  This  finding  suggests  that  the  barriers to  GenAI  adoption  may  stem  not  from  resistance  to  the  technology  itself  but  rather  from the  absence  of  formal  capacity-building  initiatives  within  public  administrations.

Some  differences  emerge  when  examining  the  potential  barriers  by  awareness  level (Q3.1)  (divided  into four classes for clarity) (Fig. 6).  Respondents  with  a  high  level of  awareness  primarily  refrain  from  using  GenAI  due  to  concerns  about  not  sharing data with providers. Although  this data-sharing concern spans all  awareness levels, respondents  with  lower  levels  of  awareness  are  more  affected  by  a  lack  of  knowledge and  confidence.  Interestingly,  a  lack  of  confidence  in  using  GenAI  tools  is  much  less common  among  those  with  a  high  level  of  awareness,  suggesting  that  there  is  a  potential link  between  trust  in  these  systems  and  an  understanding  of  how  they  function.

## 4.4 Overall  Opinion  on  Generative  Artificial  Intelligence

The  final  data  point  concerns  the  survey  respondents'  overall  opinion  on  GenAI  (Q3.7). The  results  can  be  interpreted  in  two  ways  (Fig.  7).  On  the  one  hand,  a  considerable proportion  of  the  respondents  did  not  express  a  clear  opinion,  with  over  25%  selecting  a neutral  response  ('neither  disagree  nor  agree')  for  each  statement.  On  the  other  hand,  the remaining  respondents  appear  polarised  between  positive  and  negative  views.  While  an

overall  optimistic  stance  slightly  prevails,  a  noteworthy  share  of  respondents  expressed a  negative  perspective.

The  data  reveal  some  differences  when  responses  are  compared  across  awareness levels  (Fig.  8).  Specifically,  in  terms  of  perceived  usefulness,  the  results  show  that  the more  aware  public  managers  are  of  GenAI  tools,  the  more  likely  they  are  to  find  them helpful.  This  stresses  the  relevance  of  knowledge  and  skills  in  enabling  effective  use. In  contrast,  among  those  with  very  low  awareness,  there  is  a  tendency  towards  more negative  perceptions,  including  stronger  agreement  with  statements  such  as  'it  is  not trustworthy'  or  'it  is  dangerous'.

When  comparing  responses  between  users  and  non-users  (Q3.2)  some  differences emerge  (Fig.  9).  First,  a  clear  difference  emerges  in  the  intention  to  use  GenAI  extensively  (Q3.2  -  second  response):  non-users  tend  to  disagree  with  this  statement,  whereas public  managers  who  are  using  GenAI  or  plan  to  use  it  in  the  future  are  more  likely  to agree.  Conversely,  agreement  with  negative  statements,  such  as  concerns  about  danger or  discrimination  or  a  lack  of  trust,  is  slightly  lower  among  users  than  non-users.

## 5 Discussion

This  section  reflects  on  how  GenAI  tools  may  be  reshaping  technology  adoption  and  use in  the  public  sector,  potentially  challenging  established  assumptions  in  both  research  and practice.  Given  the  preliminary  and  exploratory  nature  of  this  study,  the  discussion  does not  aim  to  provide  an  exhaustive  analysis  but  instead  draws  attention  to  a  set  of  intriguing insights that may  inform  future  research.  In particular, it seeks to  identify  emerging themes  in  how  public  managers  perceive  and  engage  with  GenAI  and  to  consider  what these  patterns  might  suggest  for  broader  debates  around  digital  transformation  in  the public  sector.

## 5.1 From  Working  with  to  Thinking  with

The  literature  on  AI  has  already  pointed  to  a  shift  from  machines  simply  supporting human  tasks  to  more  collaborative  interactions  between  humans  and  machines  (see,  for example,  [12,  13]).  This  is  often  captured  by  the  concept  of  'augmentation',  in  which AI  enhances  human  capabilities.  Traditionally,  augmentation  has  involved  AI  assisting humans  in  completing  specific  tasks  [14],  for  instance  by  providing  recommendations

or  explanations  to  support  decision-making.  In  such  cases,  humans  might  also  fine-tune the  system  to  observe  changes  in  output,  using  AI  to  improve  efficiency  or  quality.

With  the  advent  of  GenAI,  this  understanding  of  augmentation  warrants  rethinking. While  AI  still  supports  task  completion,  GenAI  increasingly  augments  cognitive  processes.  Findings  from  our  sample  suggest  that  public  managers  experience  GenAI  not only  as a tool for efficiency, but also as a catalyst for  creativity  and  learning.  While efficiency  remains  a  core  perceived  benefit  (consistent  with  dominant  narratives  around digitalisation  in  government),  61%  of  GenAI  users  reported  using  it  weekly  for  learning purposes  and  52%  reported  using  it  weekly  for  creative  tasks.  These  patterns  suggest  a shift  away  from  purely  instrumental  uses  towards  more  intellectual  and  exploratory  interactions  with  AI  (i.e.  AI  enhances  speed  and  quality).  In  light  of  this,  GenAI  becomes  not only  a  tool  for working  with ,  but  also  a  partner  for thinking  with .  As  Cantens  [3]  suggests,  there  is  a  need  to  move  towards  'in-intellectualisation',  which  involves  integrating machines  into  the  cognitive  processes  of  public  servants.

The  implications  of  this  shift  for  public  administration  are  still  unfolding.  On  the one  hand,  innovation  in  the  public  sector  is  often  driven  by  the  individual  creativity  of public  servants,  who  must  navigate  rigid  structures  and  regulatory  constraints.  GenAI has  the  potential  to  support  and  amplify  this  creativity  by  offering  new  perspectives, accelerating  ideation  or  reducing  cognitive  load.  On  the  other  hand,  because  GenAI  is trained  on  historical  data,  it  may  reinforce  dominant  patterns  and  limit  the  emergence  of genuinely  novel  ideas.  This  underscores  the  continued  importance  of  maintaining  space for  unconventional,  human-driven  thinking  to  prevent  the  stagnation  of  the  innovation cycle.

## 5.2 From  Ensuring  Use  to  Ensuring  Fair  Use

Discussions  on  AI  adoption  in  the  public  sector  often  focus  on  how  to  move  beyond pilot  programmes  and  achieve  sustained  use  by  public  servants.  Scholars  have  noted  that many  AI  solutions  remain  confined  to  the  laboratory  due  to  constraints  such  as  limited funding,  technical  complexity  and  the  need  for  ongoing  training  and  maintenance  [8, 15].  However,  the  scenario  considerably  shifts  when  it  comes  to  GenAI.  These  tools are widely  available and can  be  used  without  specialised  implementation  processes, making  them  readily  available  for  public  servants.  Our  data  support  this  shift:  30%  of respondents  already  report  using  GenAI  tools,  and  adoption  is  likely  to  grow,  as  41%  of non-users  cite  a  lack  of  knowledge  as  the  main  barrier.

These  findings  suggest  that  the  main  challenge  is  no  longer  ensuring  adoption  but rather  understanding  the  diversity  of  use.  In  contrast  with  more  traditional  IT  systems, GenAI  does  not  have  fixed  usage  paths  or  standardised  workflows.  Its  open-ended  and general-purpose  nature  enables  a  high  degree  of  individual  interpretation  and  improvisation.  Two  public  servants  may  approach  the  same  task  with  the  same  tool  and  apply it  in  entirely  different  ways  or  not  at  all.  Moreover,  if  one  public  servant  leaves  and  is replaced,  the  way  they  perform  their  duties  may  be  different  due  to  a  different  use  of GenAI  tools.  There  is  no  one-size-fits-all  instruction  manual.

Moreover,  the  use  of  GenAI  raises  new  concerns.  For  instance,  22%  of  respondents reported  avoiding  these  tools  due  to  data-sharing  concerns,  and,  while  less  prominent in  our  sample,  environmental  impact  was  also  noted.  In  this  context,  the  question  is  no

longer  only  about whether public  servants  use  GenAI,  but how it  is  being  used  and  how to  ensure  that  this  use  is  equitable  and  responsible.

Therefore,  there  is  a  need  to  shift  the  focus  from  ensuring  use  to  ensuring  fair  use. 'Fair'  in  this  context  refers  to  both  procedural  equity,  acknowledging  that  individuals may  engage  with  GenAI  differently  or  not  at  all,  and  the  need  to  anticipate  and  mitigate well-known  risks  associated  with  its  use.  This  might  include  addressing  data-protection concerns,  ensuring  equal  access  to  tools  and  guidance  and  recognising  the  variability  in how  technologies  are  enacted  in  practice.

## 5.3 From  Technical  to  Cultural  Transformation

Digital  government  transformation  is  primarily  a  technical  process:  public  servants  learn to  use  the  software,  comprehend  its  advantages  and  limitations  and  apply  it  in  their  work. Public  servants  are  expected  to  transition  and  adapt  their  workflows  to  new  systems  and understand  how  their  roles  will  evolve  with  the  introduction  of  such  technology  [7].

GenAI,  however,  appears  to  introduce  a  cultural  and  affective  dimension  into  digital transformation.  Similar  to  past  disruptions  such  as  the  rise  of  social  media,  although different  in  its  use  and  workplace  implications,  GenAI  elicits  strong  individual  reactions. Our  data  reflect  this  dynamic.  While  approximately  one  quarter  of  respondents  selected a  neutral  stance  ('neither  disagree  nor  agree')  regarding  their  overall  opinion  of  GenAI, the  rest  were  polarised  between  enthusiasm  and  concern.  Notably,  43%  of  respondents agreed  (responding  'somewhat  agree',  'agree'  or  'strongly  agree')  with  the  statement that  'GenAI  must  not  be  used',  a  figure  that  is  higher  among  those  with  lower  awareness levels.

These  findings  suggest  that the initial impact  is not only technical or  procedural but also cultural, marking  a more  significant cultural transition than in the past and drawing  attention  to  the  need  to  engage  with  individual  perceptions  and  promote  critical understanding  [3].  This  means  equipping  public  servants  with  the  skills  to  grasp  how GenAI  functions,  where  its  limitations  lie  and  how  to  make  informed  decisions  about the  use  of  this  tool.  Such  efforts  may  help  to  alleviate  public  anxieties  while  reinforcing the  idea  that  GenAI  remains  a  tool  to  be  adopted  or  rejected,  depending  on  the  context and  specific  needs  and  responsibilities.

## 5.4 From  Mapped  Software  to  Shadow  Partner

The  implementation  of  new  software,  whether  AI  based  or  not,  has  traditionally  been transparent  or  often  formally  codified  within  public  administrations.  With  codification and  mapping,  monitoring  and  accountability  have  been  relatively  straightforward.  When a  tool  is  intended  for  a  specific  task  and  used  in  a  predefined  way,  its  deployment  can  be mapped,  audited  and  assessed  for  compliance.

This  logic,  however,  is  evolving.  First,  the  question  of what GenAI  should  be  used for is now  difficult to define. In our survey, we  provided  a  non-exhaustive  list  of  10 potential  tasks,  and  a  considerable  share  of  respondents  reported  using  GenAI  for  all of  them.  Second,  defining  -  and  therefore  monitoring  -  correct  usage  is  challenging. GenAI  is  emerging  as  a  silent  or  shadow  partner  [5],  often  operating  under  the  radar, and  thus  is  largely  invisible  to  traditional  forms  of  monitoring  and  evaluation.

Its  use  is  shaped  by  individual  preferences,  skills,  levels  of  digital  literacy  and,  as discussed  earlier,  personal  attitudes.  For  instance,  a  public  servant  who  is  confident  in writing  may  never  use  GenAI  for  drafting  or  editing,  while  others  may  rely  on  it  heavily for  the  same  tasks.  This  results  in  widespread  variation  in  use  that  is  neither  standardised nor  easily  trackable.

Therefore,  this  raises  new  governance  questions.  To  what  extent  should  GenAI  use be  monitored,  documented  or  even  regulated?  The  decision  to  facilitate  or  prohibit  its use  varies  considerably  across  different  administrations  and  countries,  as  shown  in  prior studies  [5].  Moreover,  in  many  cases,  use  goes  undeclared,  making  transparency  difficult to  enforce.  Whether  and  how  GenAI  use  should  be  declared,  at  least  in  principle,  remains an  open  issue,  and  practical  results  are  even  more  varied  [5].

## 6 Conclusions

GenAI  is  already  being  used  by  public  servants  in  their  daily  work,  marking  a  notable shift  in  the  digital  transformation  of  the  public  sector.  This  technological  shift  introduces characteristics  that  challenge  existing  assumptions  and  call  for  a  renewed  perspective and  research  framing.  As  with  any  emerging  technology,  it  is  essential  to  understand both  its  underlying  logic  and  its  practical  implications,  recognising  where  it  aligns  with past  innovations  and  where  it  introduces  new  dynamics.

This  paper  offers  an  initial  empirical  contribution  by  analysing  survey  data  from  576 public  managers  across  seven  Member  States.  The  distinctiveness  of  this  dataset  helps shed  light  on  how  GenAI  is  currently  being  used,  perceived  and  understood  by  public servants.  Through  its  exploratory  approach,  the  study  draws  attention  to  early  trends in  GenAI  adoption,  the  diversity  of  usage  patterns  and  the  evolving  challenges.  While the  findings  are  preliminary,  this  study  lays  the  groundwork  for  a  rapidly  developing research  agenda  (Table  1).

Abstract. The  EU  AI  Act  is  set  to  become  a  landmark  regulatory  framework for  the  ethical  and  responsible  use  of  artificial  intelligence  across  the  European Union,  presenting  both  opportunities  and  challenges  for  public  sector  institutions. This  paper  examines  how  public  institutions  in  Germany  perceive  and  respond  to the  Act's  requirements,  focusing  on  their  preparedness,  operational  adaptations, and  the  challenges  they  face.  The  paper  uses  qualitative  data  from  semi-structured interviews  with  representatives  of  federal  agencies  and  smaller  municipalities.  The findings  reveal  significant  differences  between  larger  and  smaller  institutions,  with larger  institutions  demonstrating  greater  readiness  due  to  established  resources  and expertise,  while  smaller  municipalities  struggle  with  regulatory  uncertainty  and resource  constraints.  The  paper  highlights  that  without  targeted  interventions  and improved  guidance,  smaller  entities  may  fall  behind  in  AI  innovation  and  adoption.  These  findings  have  implications  for  policymakers,  suggesting  the  need  for centralized  support  mechanisms,  resource-sharing  programs,  and  tiered  compliance  strategies  to  ensure  equitable  and  effective  implementation  of  the  EU  AI Act.

Artificial  Intelligence  (AI)  holds  massive  potential  to  transform  and  potentially  replace human  tasks  in  a  wide  range  of  applications  including  commercial,  scholarly  and  societal applications  [1].  The  use  of  AI  has  moved  beyond  academic  boundaries  and  because of  its  potential,  is  quickly  expanding  into  other  domains  such  as  public  management [2].  Many  organizations  in  the  public  sector  are  becoming  more  interested  in  utilizing the  capabilities  of  AI  and  data  science  to  implement  policies  and  to  optimize  public management  processes  [3].  Previous  research  states  that  AI  can  benefit  in  the  public sector  by  releasing  human  resources,  supporting  service  delivery,  supporting  decision

making  and  encouraging  the  reformation  of  public  sector  [4].  However,  this  potential must  be  balanced  with  ethical  and  regulatory  concerns,  especially  regarding  the  safety, transparency,  traceability  and  non-discriminatory  nature  of  AI  [5,  6].  To  address  these issues,  the  European  Union  (EU)  has  introduced  the  European  Union  AI  Act  (AIA), which  is  designed  to  regulate  AI  use,  particularly  in  high-stakes  areas  such  as  the  public sector  [7].  The  AIA  introduces  a  fresh  approach  to  assess  AI  solutions  by  focusing  on the  possible  risks  that  are  posed  by  AI  systems,  specifically  for  high-risk  systems  by mandating  stringent  compliance  measures  for  public-sector  use  [8].

Germany's  public  sector  presents  an  interesting  case  study  for  examining  the  implications  of  the  AIA.  The  country  is  one  of  the  first  in  the  EU  to  implement  a  national AI  strategy  in  2018  and  the  German  Federal  Government  has  committed  to  spending a substantial  amount  of e 5 billion on  AI  promotion  by  2025  [9].  Germany  aims  to position  itself  as  a  pioneer  in  AI  research,  development,  and  application,  with  a  particular focus  on  leveraging  AI  in  the  public  sector  to  improve  efficiency  and  service  quality [10].  The  German  AI  strategy  also  specifically  highlights  the  potential  of  AI  to  make 'public  services  more  targeted,  tailored  and  accessible  to  citizens'  [11].  However,  despite having  such  initiatives,  Germany  also  has  limited  digital  infrastructure  [12]  and  highly fragmented  standalone  solutions  used  in  the  public  sector  [13]  which  hinders  the  full potential  of  AI  implementation  in  Germany.

While  showing  so  much  potential  in  AI  implementation  in  the  public  sector,  research also  shows  that  there  is  a  unique  set  of  challenges  that  are  faced  by  Germany  in  digitization  efforts.  These  observations  raise  the  question  whether  the  implementation  of  the AIA  brought  by  the  EU  can  hinder  or  enable  the  AI  adoption  in  German  public  sector.

However,  empirical  data  on  the  potential  effects  of  this  legislation  on  AI  adoption  in Germany  remains  limited,  especially  in  terms  of  how  these  regulations  may  impact  the willingness  and  capacity  of  public  institutions  to  integrate  AI  solutions.  While  a  growing body  of  literature  explores  AI  adoption  in  the  public  sector  in  Germany,  research  examining  the  specific  impact  of  the  AIA  remains  limited.  Studies  have  typically  focused  on either  the  technological  challenges  associated  with  AI  deployment  such  as  interoperability  and  data  quality  issues,  or  the  ethical  concerns  raised  by  algorithmic  transparency and  bias  [6,  14].  This  gap  leaves  limited  insights  into  whether  and  how  regulatory  compliance  such  as  the  AIA  may  affect  the  scope,  pace,  and  effectiveness  of  AI  integration in  public  institutions  in  Germany.

To  bridge  this  gap,  this  paper  addresses  the  central  research  question,  ' How  will  the EU  AI  Act  impact  the  adoption  and  the  use  of  AI  in  the  public  sector  in  Germany? '. By  answering  this  question,  we  aim  to  provide  a  clear  understanding  on  how  the  public institutions  in  Germany  perceive  the  impact  of  the  AI  Act,  and  we  will  also  highlight the  potential  challenges  and  opportunities  that  arise  when  the  institutions  try  to  align  the goals  of  the  public  sector  with  the  provisions  of  the  AIA.

In this paper, Sect. 2 provides an overview  of the AIA  and  the AI landscape  in the German  public  sector.  Section  3 explains the research methodology  used  in  this study.  In  Sect.  4,  we  present  key  findings  from  our  semi-structured  interviews.  Section  5 discusses  the  implications  of  the  AI  Act  for  public  sector  institutions  in  Germany,  and Sect.  6  concludes  with  a  summary  of  insights  and  an  outlook  on  future  developments.

## 2 Research  Background

This  literature  review  aims  to  provide  a  critical  analysis  of  the  existing  literature  on  the implementation  of  the  AIA,  its  impact  on  AI  adoption  in  public  sector,  with  particular focus  of  the  public  sector  in  Germany.  By  building  a  solid  understanding  in  these  areas, we  aim  to  explore  the  potential  impact  of  the  AI  Act  on  AI  implementation  within  the German  public  administration.  This  foundation  will  help  the  authors  develop  a  more nuanced  understanding  of  the  possible  effects  of  the  AIA  on  the  deployment  of  AI  in German  public  institutions  and  will  guide  the  primary  study  of  using  semi-structured interviews.

## 2.1 EU  AI  Act:  Overview

The  regulatory  framework  for  artificial  intelligence  proposed  by  the  European  Commission  in  April  2021  is  the  world's  first  comprehensive  law  on  AI  [7].  This  act,  named the  Artificial  Intelligence  Act,  was  approved  by  the  European  Parliament  on  13 th March 2024  [15]. During  the initial discussion, the European  council, 2020  stated that the motive  behind  this  law  is  for  the  EU  to  become  a  'global  leader  in  the  development  of secure,  trustworthy  and  ethical  Artificial  Intelligence'  [16].  To  understand  the  term  AI systems  which  are  used  throughout  this  paper  we  use  the  definition  used  in  Article  3 (1)  of  the  AI  Act.  Article  3  (1)  defines  AI  systems  as  'a  machine-based  system  that  is designed  to  operate  with  varying  levels  of  autonomy  and  that  may  exhibit  adaptiveness after  deployment,  and  that,  for  explicit  or  implicit  objectives,  infers,  from  the  input  it receives,  how  to  generate  outputs  such  as  predictions,  content,  recommendations,  or decisions  that  can  influence  physical  or  virtual  environments'  [17].

The  AI  Act  aims  to  ensure  a high  level of protection  of public  interests, such  as health,  safety,  and  fundamental  rights,  while  fostering  innovation  and  trust  in  AI  systems  (Recitals  1-5). It applies to  providers,  deployers,  importers,  and  distributors  of AI  systems  in  the  EU,  regardless  of  whether  the  actors  are  established  in  the  EU  or  in other  countries  (Article  2).  The  AI  Act  introduces  a  risk-based  approach  and  classifies defined  AI  systems  into  multiple  risk  categories.  Different  legal  obligations  apply  to each  of  these  categories  depending  on  the  risk  level.  Based  on  the  AI  Act  Prohibited  AI Practices,  High-Risk  AI  Systems,  AI  with  transparency  obligations  and  General  Purpose AI  are  the  main  four  categories  of  risk  classification.  Furthermore,  general  purpose  AI category  is  further  categorized  and  has  two  categories  which  are  General  Purpose  AI and  General  Purpose  AI  with  systemic  risk  (Chapter  V)  [17].

The  AI  Act  defines  AI  practices  that  are  considered  a  threat  to  EU  values  as  prohibited  AI  practices,  and  the  AIA  Article  5  specifies  examples  of  these  practices  such as  subliminal  techniques  to  distort  behavior,  Exploitation  of  vulnerabilities  of  specific groups,  social  scoring  by  public  authorities,  real-time  biometric  identification  in  public spaces  for  law  enforcement,  with  limited  exceptions.  These  systems  are  strictly  banned and  cannot  be  deployed  within  the  EU.  However,  it  is  important  to  note  that  Article  2(3) states  that  AI  systems  that  are  used  for  military,  defense  or  national  security  are  exempt from  the  scope  of  the  act  [17].

The  Act  imposes  extensive  requirements  on  high-risk  AI  systems,  which  are  considered  to  pose  a  significant  threat  to  fundamental  rights  or  safety.  High-risk  systems

are  listed  in  Annex  III  and  regulated  in  Articles  6-29.  They  include  AI  used  in  critical infrastructure (e.g.,  transport  safety),  education  and  vocational  training,  employment and  worker  management,  law  enforcement  and  migration  control  and  administration  of justice.  Providers  of  high-risk  AI  systems  must  implement  a  risk  management  system (Article  9),  ensure  data  quality  (Article  10),  provide  technical  documentation  (Article 11),  and  ensure  human  oversight  (Article  14)  [17].

Systems  that  fall  under  limited  risk  AI  systems  only  require  transparency  obligations  and  these  include  chatbots,  AI  that  generates  synthetic  content  (e.g.,  deepfakes), and  systems  using  emotion  recognition.  Based  on  Article  50  of  the  AIA,  users  must  be informed  that  they  are  interacting  with  AI  or  that  content  has  been  artificially  generated. Meanwhile,  AI  systems  that  pose  negligible  risks,  such  as  spam  filters  or  recommendation  engines  are  categorized  as  minimal-risk  AI  systems  and  fall  outside  the  scope  of binding  obligations.  However,  based  on  Articles  95-96  the  AI  Act  encourages  voluntary adoption  of  ethical  codes  of  conduct  for  such  systems  [17].

This  risk-based  approach  ensures  that  the  applications  that  pose  a  higher  risk  undergo strict  oversight,  which  protects  the  fundamental  rights  of  the  users  of  these  AI  systems [18]. However,  the  act has drawn  both  criticism and praise. There  is critique of the provisions  as  well  as  interpretation  of  certain  articles  debating  that  its  effectiveness  will depend  on  how  the  laws  are  enforced  and  whether  it  strikes  the  right  balance  between safety  and  transparency  [19].

Panigutti  et  al.  [20]  and  Li  [21]  convey  in  their  research  that  transparency  is  one  of the  main  rationales  underlying  the  AIA.  Article  13(1)  states  that  high-risk  AI  systems should  be  designed  and  developed  in  a  way  that  is  transparent  for  the  users  to  understand use  the  system  and  outputs  appropriately.  Furthermore,  Article  13(2)  and  (3)  highlight that  there  should  be  clear  instructions  for  the  users,  and  they  should  clearly  communicate characteristics,  capabilities  and  limitations  of  the  AI  system  to  the  end  users.  [17] The legislation  demands  that  AI  developers  disclose  algorithmic  decision-making  processes, which  can  be  technically  challenging  given  the  complexity  of  deep  learning  models [20].  The  authors  argue  that  disclosing  algorithmic  workings  may  not  always  clarify decision-making  for  end-users,  particularly  in  high-stakes  applications  like  healthcare or  finance.  This  could  lead  to  regulatory  compliance  efforts  focusing  on  documentation rather  than  genuine  improvements  in  model  interpretability  and  fairness  [19].

Li  [21]  makes  the  argument  that  generative  AI  tools  can  be  classified  as  high-risk  due to  their  generality  and  at  the  same  time  as  limited  risk  if  a  generative  AI  tool  is  perceived as  a  chatbot.  Users  who  use  these  chatbots  must  not  only  know  they  are  interacting  with AI;  they  also  should  be  able  to  judge  the  reliability  of  answers  since  AI  can  generate false  but  convincing  information.  Therefore,  rather  than  focusing  only  on  transparency, legislators  should  also  consider  the  reliability,  explainability  and  trustworthiness  of  the solutions  [20].  This  specific  example  also  brings  the  concern  of  uncertainty  in  key  terms and definitions within the act. The  results of research done  by Holst et al. [19] has discovered that the transparency requirements of the AIA  necessarily don't  impede patentability  of  AI  innovations,  but  the  uncertainties  in  key  terms  and  definitions  within the  Act  can  affect  these  innovations  [19].  In  addition,  the  AI  Act  does  not  address  the  role, rights  or  responsibilities  of  end  users.  As  a  result,  they  have  no  opportunity  to  contest  or complain  about  LLMs.  Moreover,  the  occurrence  and  spread  of  disinformation  is  largely

due  to  deliberate  misuse  by  users,  but  without  imposing  responsibilities  on  the  user  side, it  is  difficult  to  regulate  their  harmful  use  of  AI  [22].

It  was  stated  initially  that  AIA  attempts  to  ensure  that  AI  technologies  respect  fundamental  rights  and  democratic  values  while  mitigating  risks  such  as  bias,  discrimination, and  privacy  violations  [8].  However,  Sillberg  et  al.  [22]  states  that  the  Act  could  inadvertently  reinforce  existing  biases  in  AI  models,  as  the  risk-based  approach  may  not  fully account  for  discriminatory  outcomes  embedded  in  training  data.  Scholars  have  also  raised concerns  about  the  potential  for  regulatory  overreach,  which  could  stifle  innovation  and create compliance  burdens  for  public  institutions [23]. Holst, Mayer  et al. [19] also highlights  the  concern  of  the  impact  the  AIA  can  have  on  AI  innovation  and  patenting that  these  regulations  can  encourage  and  govern  AI  innovation  but  also  hinder  innovation  in  Europe.  Valae  et  al.  [18]  stated  that  the  AI  Act  establishes  broad  principles  but leaves  many  details  to  be  determined  through  subsequent  guidance  and  self-evaluation, potentially  leading  to  legal  uncertainty.  Businesses  may  struggle  to  assess  compliance risks,  while  courts  may  face  difficulties  in  adjudicating  AI-related  disputes  due  to  vague legal  definitions  [21].  However,  the  AIA  represents  a  significant  step  in  AI  regulation, aiming  to  create  a  safer  and  more  ethical  AI  landscape  while  promoting  innovation.  Its implementation  and  impact  will  be  closely  watched  by  policymakers,  businesses,  and researchers  worldwide.

## 2.2 AI  Landscape  in  Germany  and  Use  of  AI  in  German  Public  Institutions

Germany's  National  AI  Strategy,  launched  in  2018,  aims  to  position  Germany  as  a  leader in  AI  innovation  while  ensuring  ethical  and  societal  considerations  [9].This  initiative focuses  on  the  twelve  fields  of  action  including  strengthening  research,  strengthening small  and  medium  sized  businesses  as  well  as  using  AI  for  sovereign  tasks  and  adapt administration  skills  [24].  The  German  AI  strategy  specifically  highlights  the  potential  of  AI  to  make  public  services  'more  targeted,  tailored  and  accessible  to  citizens' [11].  Public  sector  AI  applications  in  Germany  include  smart  city  initiatives,  automated administrative  processes,  and  AI-driven  healthcare  solutions  [10].  However,  the  adoption of  AI  in  the  public  sector  also  faces  unique  challenges  in  Germany.

Based  on  a  detailed  review  of  AI  adoption  in  Germany  released  by  the  Organization for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development  (OECD)  in  2024  [12],  the  limited  digital  infrastructure  in  the  public  sector  hinders  the  full  potential  of  AI  implementation in  Germany.  Despite  having  a  highly  structured  public  administration,  digitalization  is fragmented  with  organizations  using  standalone  digital  solutions  [13].  This  limits  the potential  of  implementing  AI  solutions  across  different  levels.  There  are  also  coordination  issues  since  many  AI  initiatives  in  the  public  sector  are  standalone  and  lack  cohesive integration  across  different  levels  of  public  administration.  The  OECD  report  also  mentions  the  skill  gap  and  the  need  for  more  civil  servants  with  the  knowledge  and  skillset  to implement  and  maintain  AI  systems  [12].  According  to  Djeffal  [25]  Germany  also  faces unique  challenges  in  aligning  its  public  sector  AI  initiatives  with  the  requirements  of  the AI  Act.  Djeffal's  study  also  highlights  a  lack  of  standardized  governance  frameworks and  the  need  for  greater  investment  in  technical  infrastructure  and  human  capital  [25], which  was  also  highlighted  in  the  OECD  report.

Despite these challenges, there are strengths in German  infrastructure found by the  researchers  that  can  encourage  and  accommodate  the  adoption  of  AI  in  the  public sector.  German  government  actively  promotes  the  opening  of  public  sector  data  and these  open  data  initiatives  can  be  crucial  in  AI  development,  especially  in  government services  [12].  Furthermore,  German  government  is  providing  financial  support  for  data management  in  federal  public  authorities  and  supporting  AI  startups  and  SMEs  through public  contracts  [11].  In  a  report  released  by  the  European  Parliament  in  2021,  it  was stated  that  the  German  government  will  invest  approximately e 5  billion  in  AI  by  2025 [9].  Moreover,  The  government  also  emphasizes  the  importance  of  ethical  standards in  AI  implementation,  ensuring  non-discrimination,  transparency,  and  compliance  with data  protection  and  cybersecurity  rules  [10].

## 3 Methodology

This  chapter  outlines  the  methodology  employed  to  investigate  how  the  AIA  will  affect the  adoption  and  use  of  AI  in  the  public  sector  in  Germany.  Our  research  focuses  on understanding  how  public  institutions  are  responding  to  the  requirements  of  the  AI  Act, especially  concerning  compliance  and  risks,  transparency  and  accountability.  In  order to  gather  comprehensive  insights,  a  qualitative  research  design  was  used  by  conducting semi-structured  interviews  with  AI  experts  of  public  institutions  in  Germany.

## 3.1 Interviews  and  Analysis

Qualitative  interviews  allow  a  deeper  understanding  of  the  experiences  and  challenges faced  by  the  public  institutions.  In  this  case,  semi-structured  interviews  are  conducted  as they  provide  flexibility,  while  still  having  an  interview  guide  to  not  stray  too  far  from  the main  topic.  This  way,  the  participants'  views  can  be  explored  in  more  detail,  especially on  issues  that  arise  spontaneously  from  the  conversation  [26].

Firstly,  in  preparation  for  the  interviews,  an  interview  guideline  was  created.  This involves collecting open-ended  questions  [26]  that  explore the use of AI systems  in public  institutions  and  how  the  AIA  will  affect  it.  The  general  topics  of  our  questions cover  the  awareness  and  understanding  of  the  EU  AI  Act  (e.g., Are  you  familiar  with the  EU  AI  Act  and  its  requirements? ),  the  use  of  AI  systems  (e.g., Which  AI  system  is currently  used  in  your  institution? )  and  the  perceived  impact  of  the  AI  Act  (e.g., What impact  do  you  expect  the  EU  AI  Act  to  have  on  your  institution? ),  the  strategies  adopted by  public  institutions  to  meet  the  requirements  of  the  AI  Act  (e.g., What  steps  does  your institution  plan  to  take  to  meet  the  requirements  of  the  EU  AI  Act? )  and  the  anticipated benefits  and  challenges  (e.g., What  are  the  expected  advantages  and  potential  difficulties associated  with  the  implementation  of  the  EU  AI  Act?).

The  interviews  were  conducted  in  German  in  order  to  make  the  participants  feel more  comfortable  talking  about  their  experiences.  They  lasted  around  30  min  and  were recorded  with  the  consent  of  the  participants  as  well  as  transcribed  for  further  analysis.

The public institutions were already informed about the topic beforehand. This ensured  that  the  selected  participant  possessed  the  relevant  knowledge  and  expertise

for  the  interview.  Thus,  the  sample  consists  of  AI  experts  from  different  public  institutions  across  Germany.  We  identified  relevant  public  institutions  through  their  public participation  in  AI  projects.  This  resulted  in  a  total  of  15  interviews  with  AI-experts and  IT-experts  from  several  public  administration  IT-departments  and  private  research institutions.

After conducting  the interviews, the data analysis followed. We  applied the linear  process  of  qualitative  research  proposed  by  Williams  and  Moser  [27]  in  order  to generate  theory  and  create  meaning  out  of  the  collected  data  from  the  interviews  (  \* MERGEFORMAT  Fig.  1).  The  coding  process  starts  with  open  coding,  where  the  different  concepts  and  themes  are  identified  in  order  to  categorize  the  collected  data.  For this,  the  participants'  responses  were  categorized  based  on  similar  words  or  phrases  to identify  broad  themes  that  were  covered  in  the  interviews.  During  the  second  level  of coding,  the  axial  coding,  the  identified  themes  were  further  refined  by  relating  the  open codes  to  one  another.  Selective  coding  is  the  last  step  before  the  theory  development  and the  constructing  of  meaning.  Here,  the  main  thematic  category  was  selected  by  further refining  the  collected  data  and  identified  codes  and  categories  [27].

## 4 Results

This  chapter  presents  findings  from  interviews  conducted  with  representatives  of  public sector  institutions  in  Germany,  focusing  on  their  experiences  with  the  AIA.  It  provides an overview  of how  the Act has impacted  AI  adoption, use, and operational strategies  by  exploring  key  themes  such  as  institutional  awareness,  operational  adaptations, challenges,  and  public  trust.  The  structure  of  the  results  section  follows  the  key  codes identified  during  the  coding  process.

## 4.1 Awareness  and  Understanding  of  the  EU  AI  Act

The interviews revealed varying levels of awareness and understanding of the  AIA among  public  sector  representatives.  Larger  institutions  generally  showed  greater  familiarity  with  the  Act's  requirements.  They  often  pointed  to  specific  efforts  to  prepare  for compliance.  For  example,  one  respondent  from  a  federal  agency  stated,  ' We  are  currently collecting  all  AI  use  cases  to  classify  them  into  risk  categories  as  required  by  the  EU AI  Act. '  Conversely,  many  smaller  municipalities  expressed  uncertainty  and  described their  approach  as  reactive  rather  than  proactive.  One  respondent  noted,  ' We  have  it  on our  radar,  but  it's  too  early  to  act  without  clearer  guidelines. '  Another  respondent  highlighted  the  challenge  of  integrating  the  AI  Act's  requirements  into  existing  workflows, explaining,  ' Our  IT  team  is  aware  of  the  law,  but  without  clear  templates,  we're  reluctant

to  proceed. '  However,  some  municipalities  demonstrated  awareness  of  specific  compliance  requirements,  such  as  training  requirements  for  personnel  working  with  AI  systems. One  respondent  said,  ' We  have  already  trained  our  colleagues.  But  I  know  many  other municipalities  are  hearing  about  this  for  the  first  time. '  Another  respondent  noted  that this  last-minute  approach  to  compliance  felt  familiar,  commenting,  ' It feels a bit like GDPR,  where  we  had  to  start  training  people  three  days  before  the  deadline. '

The  gap  between  municipalities  and  larger  institutions  was  also  evident  in  the  level  of detail  with  which  they  discussed  the  Act's  provisions.  While  federal  agencies  and  larger cities  frequently  mentioned  efforts  to  align  their  processes  with  the  risk  classification system  outlined  in  the  Act,  smaller  municipalities  were  often  still  in  the  information gathering  stage.  As  one  representative  of  a  smaller  city  explained,  ' We  rely  heavily  on our  regional  IT  center  to  guide  us  through  the  compliance  requirements. '  This  reliance echoes  the  challenges  cited  by  smaller  municipalities  interviewed,  who  said  they  often lack  the  resources  to  navigate  such  complex  regulatory  frameworks  on  their  own.

## 4.2 Transparency,  Accountability,  and  Ethical  Concerns

Transparency  and  accountability  were  recurring  themes  in  the  interviews,  with  institutions across the board emphasizing  their  importance.  Larger  institutions  described specific  measures  they  had  implemented,  such  as  AI  registries  and  audit  processes.  One federal  respondent  shared,  ' We  have  implemented  confidence  indicators  to  help  users understand  the reliability of AI results. ' Similarly, a city  government  representative noted,  ' We  use  visual  indicators  to  show  how  confident  the  AI  is  in  its  recommendations. '  These  tools  were  seen  as  essential  not  only  for  compliance  with  the  AIA,  but  also for  fostering  public  trust  in  AI  applications.

Ethical  concerns  were  particularly  pronounced  in  applications  involving  sensitive data  or  decisions.  One  participant  commented,  ' Ethical  concerns  about  bias  and  societal  impact  need  to  be  addressed,  especially  in  applications  such  as  asylum  processing. ' Another  stated,  ' The  risk  of  unintentional  bias  in  algorithmic  decision-making  is  something  we  need  to  be  vigilant  about. '  Municipalities  expressed  similar  concerns,  but  with a  focus  on  public  facing  applications.  One  city  representative  commented,  ' We  are  cautious  about  using  generative  AI  tools  as  they  often  rely  on  data  processed  outside  the EU. '  The  ethical  implications  of  AI  use  were  further  complicated  by  privacy  issues, as  participants  discussed  the  challenges  of  balancing  technological  advances  with  strict privacy  requirements.  For  example,  one  participant  noted,  ' Data  often  goes  to  the  U.S., and  we  don't  know  how  it's  being  handled;  that's  a  big  concern. '  Another  participant explained  how  his  institution  manages  this  tension,  stating,  ' All  data  used  in  AI  systems is  anonymized  and  segregated  from  operational  databases  to  comply  with  privacy  regulations. '  Larger  institutions  described  well-established  data  handling  processes,  while smaller  municipalities  often  relied  on  external  systems  and  vendors  to  ensure  compliance.

## 4.3 Public  Trust  and  Citizen  Engagement

Interviewees  emphasized  the  importance  of  building  public  trust  to  ensure  the  successful adoption  of  AI  technologies.  Several  institutions  have  made  efforts  to  make  their  AI systems  more  transparent  and  accessible  to  citizens.  As  one  participant  said,  ' It's  not

enough  for  systems  to  comply  with  the  Act;  they  also  need  to  be  understandable  to  the public  to  avoid  mistrust. '  Another  explained  how  their  institutions  use  citizen  feedback to refine AI applications, stating,  ' We  have held public forums  to  demonstrate  how our  AI  systems  work  and  address  concerns  directly. '  These  initiatives  aim  to  foster  a collaborative relationship between  institutions and citizens, reducing  skepticism  and increasing  acceptance  of  AI  tools.

Public  trust  was  also  discussed  in  the  context  of  improving  citizen  confidence  in  AI systems.  Institutions  emphasized  the  need  for  transparency  tools  tailored  to  explain  AI operations  in  a  way  that  is  understandable  to  non-expert  users.  One  respondent  highlighted  initiatives  to  ensure  clarity,  stating,  ' We  make  sure  that  whenever  citizens  interact with  an  AI  system,  they  understand  how  it  reaches  conclusions  through  simple,  visual explanations. '  Additionally,  efforts  to  proactively  engage  citizens  in  AI-related  decisions  were  noted.  One  respondent  described  their  engagement  efforts  by  stating,  ' We've organized  open  door  events  where  citizens  can  observe  AI  in  action  and  provide  feedback on  its  usage  in  real-time  services. '  These  efforts  also  aim  to  increase  public  understanding  and  foster  a  sense  of  shared  responsibility  in  the  adoption  of  AI.  The  discussions  also highlighted  the  importance  of  feedback  loops  between  institutions  and  citizens.  Several institutions  noted  that  they  regularly  collect  feedback  from  citizens  and  incorporate  it into  the  refinement  of  AI  tools.  For  example,  one  participant  shared,  ' After  implementing an  AI-based  chatbot,  we  conducted  surveys  to  understand  how  users  perceived  its  accuracy  and  accessibility,  which  helped  us  make  targeted  improvements. '  These  ongoing feedback  mechanisms  were  seen  as  critical  to  building  trust  and  ensuring  that  AI  systems meet  public  expectations.

## 4.4 Operational  and  Organizational  Adjustments

Institutions  have  made  various  operational  and  organizational  adjustments  to  comply with  the  AIA.  A  representative  of  a  federal  agency  stated,  ' We  are  developing  internal  policies  and  conducting  training  programs  to  ensure  compliance  across  departments. '  These  efforts  often  involved  interdisciplinary  collaboration,  with  IT,  legal  and policy  experts  working  together.  As  one  interviewee  described,  ' Having  diverse  expertise  ensures  that  our  AI  systems  are  both  compliant  and  operationally  effective. '  Pilot programs  emerged  as  a  key  strategy  for  refining  AI  applications.  As  one  respondent  from a  larger  institution  explained,  ' Pilot  institutions  tested  our  AI  system,  and  their  feedback was  incorporated  iteratively  during  development. '  These  programs  were  described  as helpful  in  identifying  potential  problems  early  and  ensuring  alignment  with  the  requirements  of  the  AI  Act.  In  contrast,  smaller  municipalities  reported  fewer  pilot  initiatives, often  citing  resource  constraints  as  a  limiting  factor.

Some  institutions  highlighted  their  efforts  to  develop  flexibility  in  their  AI  strategies to  adapt  to  new  technologies  and  regulations.  For  example,  one  municipality  shared,  ' We are  built  to  be  language  model  neutral  and  can  switch  to  open  source  systems  such  as Llama  as  needed.  This  approach  minimizes  risk. '  Such  measures  aim  to  reduce  reliance on  a  single  vendor,  while  maintaining  compliance  with  evolving  standards.  In  general, municipalities  described  a  more  limited  range  of  operational  adaptations,  largely  due to  financial  and  staffing  challenges.  As  one  respondent  from  a  smaller  city  shared,  ' We rely  on  external  guidance  because  we  don't  have  the  capacity  to  handle  it  internally. '

Despite  these  limitations,  some  local  governments  have  made  notable  efforts,  particularly in  implementing  AI  for  specific  use  cases,  such  as  citizen  service  chatbots  and  document classification.

## 4.5 Adoption  of  AI  for  Routine  Tasks

Despite  the  challenges  posed  by  the  AIA,  many  institutions  are  actively  using  AI  to improve  the  efficiency  of  routine  tasks.  Larger  institutions  reported  extensive  use  of  AI for  tasks  such  as  document  classification,  data  extraction,  and  citizen  service  chatbots. As  one  federal  respondent  shared,  ' We  have  developed  AI  tools  to  extract  attributes  in job  descriptions  to  save  significant  time  for  our  staff. '  Local  governments  also  described smaller  scale  deployments.  As  one  city  representative  explained,  ' We  use  AI  to  automate answers  to  frequently  asked  questions,  which  has  significantly  reduced  response  times. ' Some  municipalities  are also exploring more  advanced  applications  of AI,  although these  efforts  are  often  limited  by  privacy  and  compliance  concerns.  For  example,  one city official noted,  ' We  are cautious  about  adopting  generative  AI  tools, but we  see potential  in  using  them  for  tasks  such  as  drafting  social  media  posts. '  Transparency remains  a  key  concern  for  many  institutions.  As  one  respondent  explained,  ' Our AI tools provide  detailed  output  summaries  that  users  can  quickly  review  to  assess  reliability  and accuracy  before  acting  on  recommendations. '  These  initiatives  reflect  a  broader  trend  of aligning  AI  applications  with  the  principles  of  the  AIA,  while  also  addressing  practical implementation  challenges.

In  addition,  some  participants  mentioned  the  role  of  collaboration  between  public sector  entities.  As  one  interviewee  explained,  ' We  share  best  practices  and  tools  with other  municipalities  to  ensure  that  smaller  cities  can  benefit  from  our  experience. '  Such collaboration  was  seen  as  essential  to  reduce  resource  disparities  and  promote  consistent implementation  of  the  AIA  across  the  public  sector.

## 4.6 Strategic  Use  of  AI  for  Policy  and  Decision-Making

Some  institutions  expressed  a  growing  interest  in  using  AI  for  strategic  decision-making, in  addition  to  its  use  in  routine  administrative  tasks.  While  many  AI  applications  remain focused  on  operational  efficiency,  such  as  document  processing  or  chatbots,  larger  institutions  have  begun  experimenting  with  predictive  analytics  and  other  advanced  tools  to inform  policy  decisions.  One  participant  shared,  ' We  are  piloting  AI  systems  that  can analyze  demographic  trends  to  predict  future  demand  for  public  services  such  as  healthcare  and  education. '  This  reflects  an  emerging  interest  in  using  AI  to  support  long-term planning  efforts.  Several  interviewees  also  mentioned  AI's  role  in  improving  resource allocation,  with  one  respondent  explaining,  ' We've  developed  a  model  that  helps  us  predict  which  neighborhoods  will  have  the  greatest  need  for  social  services  over  the  next five  years,  so  we  can  allocate  resources  more  effectively. '  These  initiatives  are  examples of  how  institutions  are  exploring  the  potential  of  AI  beyond  day-to-day  efficiency.  At the  same  time,  respondents  highlighted  the  challenges  associated  with  implementing  AI in  strategic  contexts.  Concerns  were  raised  about  the  reliability  and  explainability  of  AI models,  particularly  in  high-stakes  decision-making  scenarios.  As  one  participant  noted, ' When  we  use  AI  for  strategic  decisions,  it's  critical  that  the  underlying  assumptions

are  transparent  and  that  decision  makers  can  understand  the  limitations  of  the  data  and models. '  These  challenges  were  highlighted  as  key  considerations  for  ensuring  that  AI systems  are  not  only  effective,  but  also  consistent  with  the  principles  of  accountability and  fairness  outlined  in  AIA.

## 4.7 Challenges  and  Constraints

Legal  uncertainty  was  a  prominent  challenge  identified  by  respondents.  Many  participants  expressed  confusion  about  how  to  interpret  and  implement  certain  provisions  of the  AIA.  One  respondent  noted,  ' The  Act  is  important,  but  it  leaves  a  lot  of  questions unanswered. '  Another  mentioned,  ' We're  trying  to  figure  out  how  this  integrates  with GDPR  and  local  data  protection  laws. '  This  lack  of  clarity  has  led  some  institutions  to take  a  cautious  approach,  delaying  the  implementation  of  new  AI  systems  until  further guidance  is  available.  Participants  also  noted  the  risk  of  fragmented  implementation, particularly  among  smaller  entities.  As  one  city  representative  explained,  ' Without  centralized  guidance,  each  municipality  could  end  up  creating  its  own  interpretation  of  the law,  leading  to  inconsistencies. ' This concern  was  often  raised  in the context  of the lack of  a  clear,  centralized  framework  that  respondents  felt  could  help  address  these inconsistencies.

Resource  disparities between  larger institutions and smaller municipalities were another  recurring  theme.  Smaller  municipalities  often  reported  difficulties  in  allocating the  resources  necessary  to  comply  with  the  AI  Act.  As  one  city  representative  explained, ' We  don't  have  the  financial  capacity  to  hire  specialized  personnel,  which  means  we depend  on  external  consultants  for  key  compliance  tasks. '  In  contrast,  one  federal  agency noted,  ' We  have  a  dedicated  team  that  handles  risk  classification  and  compliance. '  Concerns  about  barriers  to  innovation  were  also  raised.  One  participant  commented,  ' The compliance  process  often  diverts  attention  and  funding  away  from  piloting  new  AI  solutions. '  This  sentiment  was  particularly  prevalent  among  municipalities,  where  budgets are  already  stretched  thin.  Despite  these  challenges,  many  participants  recognized  the importance  of  legislation  in  establishing  a  framework  for  the  responsible  use  of  AI.

## 5 Discussion

This  study  explores  how  the  AIA  impacts  the  adoption  and  use  of  AI  in  public  institutions  in  Germany.  Semi-structured  interviews  were  conducted  with  representatives  from various  public  institutions  to  gain  insight  into  how  they  are  affected  by  the  Act,  especially concerning  compliance  and  risks,  transparency  and  accountability.

## 5.1 Interpretation  of  Key  Findings

Overall,  our  findings  greatly  correspond  with  our  initial  research.  Most  public  institution in  Germany  are  aware  of  the  AIA.  However,  the  level  of  understanding  and  preparedness vary  significantly.  Larger  institutions  are  more  aware  of  the  specific  requirements  of  the Act  and  are  already  in  the  process  of  meeting  those  requirements,  likely  due  to  their established  digital  transformation  teams  and  dedicated  resources.  Smaller  municipalities

on  the  other  hand,  while  aware  of  the  Act  in  general,  rely  heavily  on  external  guidance and  resources  to  adapt  their  processes,  indicating  a  gap  in  internal  expertise  that  could hinder  compliance  efforts.  Thus,  while  the  need  to  adapt  to  the  regulations  applies  to  all institutions,  especially  the  smaller  ones  confirm  that  they  are  mostly  burdened  by  this because  of  the  lack  of  IT  expertise  and  resources.

All  public  institutions  interviewed  agree  that  transparency  and  accountability  are important  aspects  to  be  considered  when  working  with  AI.  While  Li  [21]  sees  a  lack  of focus  in  the  regulation  on  aspects  such  as  reliability,  explainability  and  trustworthiness  of AI  systems,  many  institutions  already  take  measures  to  strengthen  trust  and  confidence  in these  AI  systems  and  their  results.  However,  ethical  considerations  such  as  unintentional bias  are  still  a  major  challenge  as  they  are  more  difficult  to  deal  with.  The  complexity of  deep  learning  models  also  makes  communicating  this  to  the  end  users  challenging.

Another  major  challenge  identified  by  the  public  institutions  is  legal  uncertainty. Since  some  key  terms  and  definitions  of  the  AIA  are  still  confusing  to  most  institutions, they  are  hesitant  to  implement  any  new  AI  systems.  Thus,  this  aligns  with  Holst  et  al. [19]  pointing  out  that  these  uncertainties  can  also  affect  innovation.  Furthermore,  there  is a  fear  of  inconsistency  if  every  institution  interprets,  and  thus  implements,  it  differently. This could lead to coordination  issues across different levels of the public sector in Germany,  which  hinders  the  cohesive  integration  of  AI.  This  is  why  institutions  hope for more  support and guidance  by creating a central  framework.  Moreover,  smaller municipalities  are  facing  additional  issues  due  to  their  lack  of  resources  in  personnel and  budget  as  well  as  technical  expertise.  This  further  fuels  the  concerns  about  innovation as  the  focus  now  lies  on  adapting  current  AI  systems  instead  of  finding  new  solutions.

Despite  the  challenges  that  public  institutions  are  faced  with  when  it  comes  to  adopting  AI,  it  is  commonly  used  to  increase  efficiency  in  routine  tasks  and  reduce  response times  when  interacting  with  citizens.  This  is  also  the  reason  why  most  public  institutions  find  the  AIA  to  be  important.  It  provides  a  framework  for  the  responsible  use  of AI,  which  allows  both  the  institutions  and  the  citizens  to  benefit  from  AI  use  in  public institutions.  Furthermore,  larger  institutions  are  also  considering  going  beyond  everyday  tasks  and  using  AI  in  strategic  decision-making  processes,  although  this  comes  with further  challenges  regarding  transparency  and  accountability.  This  shows  that  the  AIA can  also  promote  innovation,  as  stated  by  Holst  et  al.  [19],  if  enough  necessary  resources are  available.

On  the  other  hand,  there  were  also  discrepancies  between  the  topics  emphasized  in  the literature  and  those  reflected  in  our  interview  findings.  Our  background  research  points out  that  the  AIA  does  not  take  the  role  of  the  end  users  into  consideration,  even  though they  also  take  part  in  the  occurrence  and  spread  of  disinformation  for  example  [22]. While  this  could  pose  an  additional  challenge  in  regulating  the  harmful  use  of  AI,  this was  not  an  aspect  addressed  during  our  interviews,  even  though  AI  is  used  externally (e.g. Chatbots)  as  well  as internally (e.g. AI as  support  systems).  This  indicates  that this  is  not  considered  to  be  one  of  the  major  challenges  that  the  public  institutions  are facing  right  now.  Moreover,  previous  studies  identify  a  back  and  forth  between  the  fear of  regulatory  overreach  [23]  and  the  fear  of  the  regulation  being  too  broad  [18].  Both alternatives  lead  to  issues  for  public  institutions  as  on  the  one  hand  they  could  be  facing compliance  issues  if  the  regulation  is  too  strict,  but  on  the  other  hand,  there  is  the  issue  of

legal  uncertainty  if  it  is  too  broad.  However,  the  regulation  is  likely  formulated  vaguely on  purpose  because  policymakers  would  have  to  be  careful  to  cover  every  existing  case otherwise.  Thus,  the  Act  purposefully  aims  to  regulate  the  use  of  AI  while  still  leaving room  for  interpretation  in  order  to  at  least  cover  the  most  important  aspects.

## 5.2 Impact  of  the  EU  AI  Act  and  Implications  of  This  Study

Based  on  our  findings,  we  can  conclude  that  the  AIA  has  a  mixed  impact  on  the  public institutions  in  Germany.  Overall,  all  institutions  agree  that  the  AIA  will  significantly impact  AI  deployment  within  public  institutions.  However,  they  cannot  agree  on  whether this  impact  is  positive  or  negative.  While  larger  institutions  view  it  as  an  opportunity to  enhance  transparency  and  ethical  practices  to  foster  public  trust  in  AI,  municipalities are  more  concerned  about  potential  delays,  resource  strains,  and  administrative  burdens that  come  with  the  requirements  of  the  AIA.  While  the  Act  is  acknowledged  as  a  needed regulatory framework  for  AI  governance,  the lack of clear guidelines and resources poses  notable  challenges  for  smaller  institutions.  Furthermore,  the  Act  is  perceived  to be  open  to  multiple  interpretations,  thus  hindering  uniform  implementation.  This  mixed perception  reflects  a  tension  between  the  desire  to  ensure  the  responsible  use  of  AI  in the  public  sector  in  Germany  and  the  practical  challenges  associated  with  meeting  these regulatory  requirements.

The  findings  of  this  study  have  several  implications  for  both  policymakers  and  public institutions.  The  challenges  identified  in  our  findings  are  mostly  concerned  with  clarity and  resource  constraints.  This  suggests  that  more  guidance  and  support  is  needed  to help  institutions  of  all  sizes  comply  with  the  AI  Act.  Thus,  policymakers  could  consider providing  more  guidance  on  interpreting  and  implementing  the  requirements  of  the  AI regulations.  Further,  smaller  municipalities  would  benefit  from  policymakers  addressing the  resource  constraints  and  possibly  offering  subsidies,  training  programs  or  a  phased compliance  approach  for  example.

The  public  institutions  themselves  need  to  work  on  broadening  their  IT  expertise and  infrastructure  as  much  as  possible  in  order  to  meet  the  requirements.  Larger  institutions  are  overall  better  prepared,  which  offers  opportunities  for  sharing  knowledge  and collaborating  between  institutions  of  different  sizes  in  order  to  aid  the  public  sector  in Germany  to  comply  with  the  AIA  as  a  whole.

## 6 Conclusion  and  Outlook

Through  semi-structured  interviews  with  representatives  from  various  German  institutions,  ranging  from  federal  agencies  to  smaller  municipalities,  we  found  that  the  AIA  is viewed  as  both  an  opportunity  to  promote  the  ethical  and  transparent  use  of  AI  and  a  significant  challenge.  Our  findings  highlight  the  impact  that  institutional  size,  resources,  and expertise  have  on  the  ability  of  public  institutions  to  comply  with  the  Act.  Generally, larger  institutions  demonstrated  greater  readiness  and  confidence  in  meeting  compliance  requirements  and  using  AI  for  strategic  purposes.  In  contrast,  smaller  institutions faced  resource  constraints,  regulatory  uncertainty,  and  operational  difficulties  that  hindered  their  ability  to  adapt.  The  lack  of  clear,  centralized  guidance,  in  particular,  has

exacerbated disparities between  institutions and created confusion around the interpretation  and  implementation  of  risk  classification  and  privacy  requirements.  Without targeted  interventions,  such  as  centralized  support  frameworks,  resource-sharing  programs,  and  clearer  communication  of  regulatory  expectations,  smaller  institutions  risk falling  behind  in  AI  adoption  and  innovation.  Therefore,  policymakers  should  prioritize addressing  these  disparities  by  providing  targeted  support  and  clear,  actionable  guidance. Collaboration  between  institutions  of  different  sizes,  combined  with  tiered  compliance strategies,  could  help  bridge  resource  gaps  and  encourage  the  sharing  of  best  practices. By  promoting  a  more  inclusive  approach  to  compliance,  the  AIA  can  foster  public  trust and  support  innovation  across  all  levels  of  the  German  public  sector.

However,  several  limitations  must  be  acknowledged.  First,  the  interviews  were  conducted  in  December  2024  and  January  2025,  during  the  early  stages  of  the  AI  Act's  implementation.  The  relatively  small  sample  size,  limited  participant  diversity  and  underrepresentation  of  rural  institutions  may  limit  the  generalizability  of  the  findings.  Although smaller municipalities were included, their challenges may  not accurately represent the specific realities of  rural  institutions.  Additionally,  participants'  varying  levels  of familiarity  and  understanding  of  the  AIA  may  have  influenced  their  responses.

To overcome  these  limitations,  future research should  include  a larger  and  more diverse  sample.  Ideally,  the  sample  would  include  small,  midsize,  and  large  institutions for direct comparison.  A  broader, more  representative dataset could clarify  whether the observed challenges are consistent across different types of public institutions. Additionally,  longitudinal  studies  could  track  how  public  sector  institutions adapt as the  legal  framework  and  AI  technologies  evolve.  Finally,  future  studies  could  examine  how  policymakers,  particularly  at  the  EU  level,  can  better  communicate  regulatory requirements.

Abstract. Digital transformation in public administration requires the development of digital government competences (DGCs) among public servants. Self-reflection, a critical personality-related DGC, fosters adaptability and continuous learning but remains challenging to cultivate through traditional training. Employing a design science research approach, we developed ReflectAI, an LLM-based AI coach designed to support public servants in developing self-reflection competence. The system was evaluated through a two-week user study with seven public servants. Our findings revealed three key benefits: increased awareness of self-reflection opportunities, improved thought structure, and valuable conversation documentation. Implementation challenges included time constraints, technical infrastructure limitations, and organizational support. Our study contributes to research by demonstrating the applicability of AI coaching to personality-related DGC development, thus extending the body of knowledge of both competence development and AI coaching. With regard to practice, we highlight the importance of structured self-reflection processes and the required organizational conditions necessary for successful adoption. The resource-efficient approach to developing self-reflection competence facilitates this adoption through an innovative application of AI in public organizations.

## 1 Introduction

The digitalization of public organizations has long not been a means in itself but an essential necessity in living up to its value propositions, that is, the efficient provision of (digital) public services [ 33] and the generation of public value [ 38]. However, public organizations are lagging behind in digitally transforming, especially compared to their private sector counterparts [ 8]. For successful digital transformation, there is broad academic agreement on the significance of the public servants working inside these organizations [ 15, 28] and their digitalization competences [ 12] - henceforth referred to as digital government competences

(DGCs). Public servants lacking DGCs, in turn, are a barrier to digital government (DG) success [ 40]. Consequently, a substantial research stream has emerged that considers DGC education and development through, i.e., formalized education [ 19], MOOC-based learning [ 9, 22], or using simulation games [ 18].

These publications, however, focus on a rather restricted competence understanding, especially promoting skills and knowledge, for instance, in artificial intelligence (AI), business process management, or general DG knowledge. This narrow understanding neglects modern conceptions of competence , which not only involve skills and knowledge but also personality-related components [ 6]. In fact, these personality-related competence components are fundamental for DGC acquisition, given their importance in yielding the intent to develop knowledge and skills in the first place [ 6]. Chen and Chang (2010) thereby speak of a 'bottom up causal relationship' [ 6, p. 685] between a hidden layer (personality) and visible layer (abilities, i.e., knowledge and skills) of competence. This relevance of personality has also been confirmed for DG by Distel et al. (2019) [ 12].

One such personality-related DGC is self-reflection, which is defined as 'intraindividual processes [...] to capture inter-individual differences in behavior' [ 2, p. 514]. In other words, self-reflection allows public servants to assess their reasoning and behavior with respect to their interactions with others. Based on this systematic assessment, self-reflection has proven essential in adapting to challenges and continuously developing new competences to navigate the complexity of change processes [ 5] like the digital transformation; therefore, we consider self-reflection as a prerequisite for other DGCs [ 5], such as critical thinking, communication, continuous learning, or leadership.

Developing personality-related DGCs is tricky, because they 'cannot be acquired through formal education' [ 12, p. 291]. However, in line with other researchers, we argue that more informal and exchange-oriented approaches like coaching bear significant potential [ 7] for the development of personality-related DGCs. Such formats, however, are scarce in public organizations, which is likely attributable to a lack of awareness, time and financial resources, and a limited number of available coaches. To overcome these bottlenecks, recent developments in generative AI suggest AI coaching , which promises to enhance cost efficiency and flexibility of coaching practices [ 10].

Thus, our article aims to explore the potential of AI coaching for developing personality-related DGCs with a particular focus on self-reflection. We employ a design science research (DSR) approach to achieve the following goal:

Design and evaluation of ReflectAI, an AI coach to support public servants in developing self-reflection competence.

Our results expand the body of knowledge on overcoming digital transformation challenges in public organizations. More specifically, we contribute to the literature on DGCs, with a particular focus on personality-related DGCs and self-reflection. Additionally, we contribute to research on AI applications in the public sector, highlighting their potential for competence development.

The remainder of this article first presents the relevant research background and elaborates on the DSR process, before presenting our artifact and the evaluation results. Afterward, the results are discussed with respect to their contributions before concluding with final remarks.

## 2 Research  Background

## 2.1 Digital  Government  Competence  and  Self-Reflection

Despite its relevance, a unified definition for DGC is still absent. For instance, Distel et al. (2019) [ 12] define competences 'as knowledge, skills, and abilities', Halsbenning et al. (2021) [ 17] as 'abilities to cope with digitalization', and Koddebusch et al. (2024) [ 21] as a 'combination of [...] skills, knowledge, self-concept, and motives', whereby self-concept and motives refer to personality as per Chen and Chang (2010) [ 6], who have also described the competence concept as 'fuzzy'.

For the context of this article, we draw on a combination of the above. Our primary DGC source is Distel et al. (2019) [ 12], as their framework comprehensively incorporates personality-related competences, aligning with our theoretical understanding that personality is an essential dimension of competence. We amend their understanding of competence, however, with the one of Chen and Chang (2010) [ 6], who conceptualize personality as an inseparable component of competence. Our DGC understanding, therefore, comprises both the abilities (skills and knowledge) and the personality of public servants to act in a digitally transforming public sector.

Self-reflection is one of 18 personality-related DGCs Distel et al. (2019) [ 12] identified in their review. As outlined in the introduction, we understand selfreflection as a critical prerequisite to other DGCs, such as critical thinking, communication, continuous learning, or leadership. In digitalized environments, selfreflection fosters learning, adaptability, and a continuous evaluation of the own role and responsibilities [ 32, 34]. Therefore, individuals with high self-reflection proficiency are known to be key drivers of organizational renewal, as their ability to critically assess their own practices and adapt accordingly fosters innovation and continuous improvement within the organization [ 35].

Given this significance, scholars have proposed several models to guide selfreflection competence acquisition, typically in multi-step conceptualizations of competence development [e.g., 13, 23]. Among these, Korthagen's ALACT model [ 24] stands out as the most suitable option for our purposes. The model provides a five-step framework: Action, Looking Back, Awareness of Essential Aspects, Creating Alternative Methods, and Trial. Unlike more general cyclic models such as Kolb's learning cycle, the ALACT model emphasizes systematic learning from action. This focus on continuous self-reflection and improvement makes it particularly well-suited for fostering continuous professional development in practice-oriented settings such as public administration.

## 2.2 AI  Coaching

Coaching is defined as a 'dyadic helping relationship between a professional coach and client who work jointly along a systematic process of collaborative goal setting' [ 14, p. 107]. Such collaborative means of professional development have proven to be effective in developing rather personality-related competence components like the ones discussed above [ 7]. Coaching has long been a widespread tool for HR development [ 10], but as it occurs in face-to-face settings [ 10], it comes with resource constraints resulting in scalability issues.

Addressing these issues, technology-induced digital and AI coaches have emerged [ 10, 11], which employ digital technologies and AI components to substitute a human coach. Consequently, the coaching profession is expected to transform [ 14], although fully matured products and reliable insights are still scarce. Compared to human coaches, AI coaching promotes flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and availability [ 10, 14, 27]. Acknowledging challenges in AI coaching, such as limited trust-building and emotional management [ 10], scholars and practitioners are rapidly progressing in overcoming these. For instance, human coaching practices are increasingly integrated with chatbot design methodologies [ 37], accounting for theoretical foundations, relationship-building, and ethical compliance. A pertinently well-received framework was put forth by Terblanche (2020) [ 37] and will also guide the development of this article's artifact.

## 3 Method

Aiming to develop an innovative artifact, we employ the DSR methodology as per Peffers et al. (2007) [ 30]. The inherent Communication is absent here, given that the project's communication is depicted by this very article. Employing DSR supported our research objectives in two ways. First, it allowed us to gain both literature-based and practice-related insights on how self-reflection is perceived as a practice, enabling us to design our artifact accordingly. Second, it provided us with immediate feedback on the designed artifact, enabling us to collect participants' candid opinions. Figure 1 shows the research process.

Fig.  1. DSR Process

Problem Identification and Motivation: Exchange-oriented professional development means, like coaching, bear the potential to enhance DGC development, especially with regard to personality-related competences and self-reflection. However, such approaches are resource-intensive and challenging to scale.

Define Objectives of a Solution: Design and evaluation an AI coach to support public servants in developing self-reflection competence. Concrete solution objectives are (1) positive perceived or expected helpfulness in self-reflection competence development and (2) positive perceived well-being while interacting with the AI coach in terms of usability and security aspects. The artifact development shall be guided by established self-reflection and AI coaching frameworks.

Design and Development: Guided by Terblanche's AI coaching framework [ 37], we reviewed the literature by means of a Scopus database search 1 . We identified design requirements (DRs) across multiple sources, eliminated duplicates, and adapted them to our specific context. This synthesis resulted in four DRs (see Sect. 4). Building on these DRs, we developed ReflectAI, integrating various AI models (e.g., OpenAI's 4o, 4o-mini, and Whisper) with system prompting to direct the system's responses. For iterative testing, we created LLM-generated personas representing diverse roles, challenges, and reflection needs. This humancentered approach allowed us to test ReflectAI across realistic self-reflection scenarios before proceeding to user evaluation.

Demonstration and Evaluation: The demonstration and evaluation of ReflectAI was conducted with seven public servants (federal and state level) from different administrative areas, such as digital transformation, urban development, and financial administration. The participants were 35 years old on average and volunteered to partake in a 30-minute introductory interview, a two-week test phase, and a 45-minute evaluation interview. We used a convenience sampling strategy for participant selection, approaching familiar public servants from previous projects. Although they were not involved in the current research, we believed they would be open to participating in this innovative endeavor. While we acknowledge the limitations of this approach, such as a pro-digitalization bias, we believe that the insights provided are valuable for future endeavors. During the test phase, the participants could autonomously interact with ReflectAI via a web application available both on desktop computers and mobile devices. The evaluation interviews provided valuable insights with regard to our solution objectives.

We employed an inductive thematic analysis following Braun and Clarke's [ 4] guidelines. This involved transcription and an initial categorization of results. Similar categories were grouped into themes to highlight the relationships between clusters. To summarize the themes, we identified the emerging key findings, each supported by illustrative quotes.

## 4 Artifact  Description

Through a comprehensive synthesis and analysis of existing literature, we developed four key Design Requirements (DRs) for ReflectAI. Our systematic review of current research in AI coaching, human-computer interaction, and ethical AI implementation allowed us to identify critical requirements, which we consolidated into these foundational DRs. These requirements form the theoretical and practical foundation for creating an effective AI coach that meets both technical and user-centric needs.

DR 1: The AI coach should be based on established theoretical models and recognized coaching techniques to provide users with sound and competent support [ 1, 37].

- DR 2: The AI coach should convey a sense of human interaction through the use of social cues, thereby enabling users to determine the degree of humanity themselves by selecting the preferred form of interaction and appearance according to their needs [ 16, 31, 37].

DR 3: The AI coach should proactively direct users through the self-reflection process utilizing multimodal communication channels, respond to their needs, and facilitate a clear, understandable, and flexible conversation to ensure a beneficial and adaptable user experience [ 16, 37, 39].

DR 4: The AI coach and the provider should adhere to data protection regulations, uphold ethical standards, and provide transparent information about the handling of sensitive data to ensure trust, security, and the responsible management of personal information [ 1, 3, 16, 37].

The following sections detail how we systematically implemented these design requirements in ReflectAI, creating a comprehensive system that combines theoretical foundations, user-centered design, and ethical considerations.

ReflectAI employs a modular architecture to ensure flexibility, scalability, and seamless integration of AI-driven coaching functionalities. The developed system is based on a React frontend for user interactions and a Flask backend architecture for AI-supported conversation control. The application is hosted via Amazon Web Service (AWS) EC2 and data storage via Relational Databases for user profiles and conversation histories and AWS S3 buckets for audio files. The core technologies are OpenAI's GPT-4o for response generation as well as AWS Polly for text-to-speech synthesis and OpenAI's Whisper for speechto-text transcription. OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini is used to guide conversations by identifying and correcting deviating conversation content [ 20].

Prior to the introductory interview, participants received comprehensive data protection information, which was further explained during the meeting to ensure complete understanding and informed consent about data handling practices.

The user interface (Fig. 2) follows a clean, minimalist design focused on coaching interactions and familiar chat patterns. Users can customize their experience by selecting the coach's name, voice, and appearance, influencing the perceived humanity level in interactions and potentially enhancing trust [ 31]. While personalization can strengthen user engagement, Krauter [ 25] highlights that excessive realism in AI design can lead to the Uncanny Valley effect, where near-human

features cause discomfort due to subtle inconsistencies, such as mismatched emotional expressions or unnatural behaviors [ 25]. To maintain an appropriate balance of human-like interaction, we restricted customization options in both scope and realism, balancing personalization with user comfort.

The system provides visual feedback through an animated typing indicator during message processing, enhancing credibility and reinforcing perceived intelligence [ 16]. The interface supports both text and voice messaging, with automatic transcription of voice inputs and synthesis of voice outputs, ensuring accessibility and accommodating diverse user preferences.

The conversation engine implements established coaching principles through a carefully engineered system prompt that incorporates the self-reflection model while maintaining natural dialogue. Through iterative development, the prompt defines ReflectAI's role as a self-reflection coach, establishing its core goals and communication guidelines. The objectives align with the principles of the ALACT model, which comprises five phases: Action, Looking back, Awareness, Creating alternative methods, and Trial. Each phase is seamlessly integrated into the conversation flow, with respective goals and sample questions. For example, phase 2, 'Looking back,' includes questions like, 'How did you perceive the situation?' and phase 4, 'Creating alternative methods,' includes questions such as, 'What could you do differently next time?' The communication framework incorporates warm, clear, professional language, empathetic formulations (e.g., 'I understand that...') as well as active listening techniques like rephrasing and regular comprehension checks.

Additional guidelines for conversation management include the use of open and closed questions, along with clarifying questions when needed. To ensure the effectiveness of these features, the prompt development process involved iterative testing and refinement. Evaluations with both human-crafted and LLMgenerated personas optimized the balance between professional coaching competence and natural interaction.

## 5 Evaluation

The evaluation of ReflectAI followed a three-phase approach: First, we conducted introductory interviews (n = 7) to assess participants' self-reflection practices. This was followed by a two-week test phase of the prototype, after which we conducted evaluation interviews.

Introductory  Interviews. Self-reflection practices varied widely in terms of frequency and structure. While most participants reported engaging in selfreflection daily or several times a week, these moments were rarely planned or systematic. Rather, self-reflection was primarily triggered by specific events such as meetings with superior officers, conflict situations, receiving feedback, or during commutes after work. The current practice of self-reflection is predominantly informal and unstructured. The most common form of self-reflection was mental self-talk, in which situations and decisions are processed mentally. In

addition, participants regularly sought an exchange with colleagues, especially after difficult situations or important meetings. It is noteworthy that none of the participants stated that they used special tools or structured methods for selfreflection. Several participants specifically mentioned the lack of a systematic approach in their self-reflective practice as a reason.

Participants' expectations of AI coaching focused on two main aspects. Several participants expressed their interest in receiving support in systematizing their self-reflection processes, with one participant specifically mentioning: 'What would help me the most is to better structure this whole self-reflection mechanism and process [...].' Similar to other studies such as [ 26], the participants had

certain expectations of ReflectAI's ability to process language due to chatbots such as ChatGPT. As one participant noted: 'My expectations of the chatbot are basically that the question-and-answer style is appropriate and that proper language is used. This is standard nowadays and should be no worse here than in other use cases.'

Evaluation Interviews. ReflectAI's evaluation through interviews revealed several important findings. It received consistently positive feedback for its intuitive interface and ease of use. These usability aspects underpin our second solution objective, which targets positive perceived well-being regarding usability and security. Participants emphasized how straightforward it was to initiate and maintain interactions, with one participant noting: 'My initial impression was that it was easy to use.' ReflectAI's linguistic capabilities exceeded expectations, particularly in its ability to engage in meaningful dialogue while providing structured instructions and neutral feedback. One participant commented: ' I'm really positively surprised at how quickly the tool responds. You get a response to everything you type in and I usually find it helpful.'

Participants particularly valued the specific and tailored suggestions provided by ReflectAI, which aligned well with their preliminary expectations. These tailored suggestions further reflect the first solution objective of helping participants develop self-reflection competence, as highlighted by one participant: 'I found it particularly helpful when specific suggestions were provided.' The practical relevance of recommendations was frequently highlighted as a strength, with one participant expressing surprise at the high degree of relevance of the customized advice: 'It was a positive surprise [...] that some concrete solutions were found in the end. All in all, it worked really well.' ReflectAI's ability to maintain neutral language throughout interactions was also appreciated: 'ReflectAI doesn't give its own assessment, but it stays really neutral on most topics, which I really appreciate. It never says whether you're right or wrong or whether it thinks the idea itself is a good one.'

In the context of human-AI interaction, participants reported a strong sense of trust in ReflectAI. This trust originated primarily from its non-judgmental nature, which made them feel more comfortable discussing personal or sensitive topics than they would with human counterparts: 'I sometimes discussed things with the tool in a way that I would perhaps not talk to people so directly now. That was because it's 'just' a tool that I could actually tell anything to. There is no person behind it who could take offense or be overloaded.' This sense of comfort supports our second solution objective by fostering positive perceived well-being in user interactions. Interestingly, participants also described instances in which the AI aspect of ReflectAI became less apparent, suggesting a seamless integration into the conversation flow: 'There was a moment when I wasn't actively thinking about the fact that I was writing with an AI.' One participant further emphasized this potential for enhanced realism through integration into existing communication systems, noting that it would 'almost immediately feel like you're talking to a real person' if incorporated into internal chat programs.

The participants reported three main qualitative benefits of using ReflectAI. These reflections clearly tie back to our first solution objective, which highlights ReflectAI's effectiveness in fostering a perceived self-reflection competence development. Participants revealed an increased awareness regarding opportunities for self-reflection. One participant shared the growing intentionality in his self-reflective practice: '[...] I would say that, in a broader sense, I am simply thinking more actively about the topic [ed. self-reflection]. [...] I don't know yet whether I'm doing it better now [...]. But I'm definitely doing it more consciously [...].' The structured prompts provided by ReflectAI were considered useful in organizing participants' thoughts. As one participant recounted, the process of composing messages fostered a more objective and structured perspective: 'When I wrote my own message, I initially thought: 'Well, the colleague is a bit to blame'. But as I was formulating it, I thought,'Okay, if you say it like that, it's not really like that'.' Finally, participants valued the ability to revisit prior conversations, allowing them to track their thought processes and reactions over time. One participant noted: 'Unlike human conversations, I can always go back to the conversation and think: What was the situation like again? What was the reaction?'

Despite all these positive perceptions, concerns about data protection emerged as a critical factor that would influence adoption rates. Several participants expressed worries about server locations, even despite the repeated security assurances: 'I did have reservations about its lack of local server [...], despite assurances regarding data protection.' Additionally, different shortcomings were noted in the interaction patterns. ReflectAI's empathetic responses were sometimes perceived as exaggerated, with some participants preferring more direct communication: 'What I noticed is that unlike other chatbots, the AI coach always adds extra sentences that somehow simulate humanity.' The practice of paraphrasing and asking for confirmation received mixed reactions. While some saw it as a way to encourage deeper engagement, others found it unnecessarily time-consuming, noting: ' When I gave a short answer, I still got this huge text.' Finally, the critical feedback also centered on the responses feeling rigid and predictable, with one participant quickly recognizing the repetitive nature of the ALACT model: 'You understand the structure and the response behavior relatively quickly. And that is of course very schematic.' Some participants noted the limitation in providing truly personalized responses, with one stating: "A system like that can't assess my character at all and can't give me an answer that is really tailored to me as a person."

During the two-week test phase, participants used ReflectAI to reflect on past situations, as one participant describes: 'It was always about situations that I had experienced myself, and I looked at how I reacted in the situation and what the coach suggested to me afterwards.' Some also relied on it to prepare for upcoming events: 'I mainly focused on follow-up meetings, but also on preparing for meetings, for example during discussions with head teachers or in the department.' The times of use varied greatly, as some integrated ReflectAI into their daily work routine, while others used it on their way to work or at home in

the evening. Many participants mentioned a lack of time during working hours as a frequent restriction that limited their use of ReflectAI, as this participant highlights: '[...] It's also often a challenge to find the right time slots for application.' Another participant explained: 'I used it once at work when I needed a mental break between tasks... Otherwise, I've used it more privately because I can't find time for it during working hours.'

The integration of ReflectAI within the daily work environment faced several challenges, primarily regarding time management, as previously indicated. Additionally, challenges arose concerning the technical infrastructure and a lack of organizational support. Participants struggled to fit self-reflection into their structured workdays, noting a lack of allotted time and suitable spaces. One explained: 'There is simply no provision [...] for explicit time for self-reflection or personal development in the daily routine.' Strict public administration IT guidelines further limited AI tool usage on official devices, leading many to rely on private devices or outside work hours. To address these barriers, participants proposed organizational support that explicitly permits and encourages reflective activities during work hours, alongside technical solutions such as reminder features and calendar integration. For example, one participant noted: 'If the chatbot sent me a message twice a week saying, 'Hey, we haven't reflected this week yet, would you like to reflect with me?', I would definitely do so.'

Participants expressed varying interest in regularly using ReflectAI. Many could envision consistent use if it offered long-term benefits, as one participant noted: "I would be really curious to see what it's like when you use the coach over a longer period... whether you eventually feel like you've 'learned everything' or if it continues to provide new impulses." The willingness to use it depended on three main conditions: seamless technical integration into work devices ( "If it were integrated on my work PC, absolutely. As it is now, I would use it regularly, but definitely less frequently. I don't know if I would manage to remember to do it at home in the long term.' ), explicit organizational support for dedicated reflection time ( 'It needs to be wanted that employees develop themselves. To really say: It's okay if you spend an hour a day or week on this âĂŞ be it for self-reflection or other topics." ), and an active reminder system to encourage regular engagement. Some participants felt ReflectAI could not replace face-toface conversations but saw potential in soft-skills development, such as receiving feedback on argument structure: 'That you say: 'Okay, I have an argument here, I'll write it down or speak it, and then the AI will give me feedback on it'.' Trust also emerged as an obstacle, given uncertainty about the coach's 'black box' nature: '[...] you don't know exactly where he [ed. ReflectAI] gets the knowledge from or which language model is being used. For me, there's still a bit of a lack of trust.'

Finally, participants suggested several improvements for ReflectAI, focusing on customization options like adjustable communication styles, response lengths, and self-reflection models. They recommended adding a reminder system to encourage regular usage. Many participants wanted ReflectAI to maintain context across sessions, though this raised privacy concerns that would need to be addressed through transparent data handling practices.

## 6 Discussion

This study investigated the potential of AI coaching to foster self-reflection competences in public administration.

The evaluation revealed two key mechanisms through which the AI coaching facilitated self-reflection. First, the predefined structure of ReflectAI actively encouraged the implementation of self-reflective processes. Our analysis showed that structured prompts helped participants move from reactive to proactive selfreflection Our findings also align with Park et al.'s [ 29] findings on expressive writing in mental health, suggesting that the chat-based format may inherently support more natural engagement in reflective practice compared to traditional journaling approaches. This is further supported by Terblanche et al. [ 36], who found that while voice interaction boosts initial engagement, text is preferred for reflective tasks requiring careful input. ReflectAI's usage patterns confirm this tendency, as participants favored text-based input over voice input, reinforcing the idea that structured writing fosters deeper and more deliberate self-reflection. Second, regular use of ReflectAI led to an increased perceived awareness of selfreflection and a willingness to consciously reflect, which is an essential precursor to behavior change. Thus, we suggest that long-term engagement with ReflectAI could lead to a tangible increase self-reflection competence that promotes deeper and more sustainable self-reflective practice.

While one participant would not use ReflectAI for self-reflection, she identified its potential for other competences. She emphasized the promotion of soft skills such as communication, argumentation, or negotiation, which aligns with existing insights [ 41]. The integration of AI coaching into HR practices offers the opportunity to promote individual competences more targeted.

The evaluation findings indicate that the solution objectives have been successfully addressed. ReflectAI effectively supported public servants in developing their perceived self-reflection competence (SO1), and was considered intuitively usable, non-judgmental, and thus offered a solution contributing to individual well-being (SO2). However, concerns about data security emerged as a moderating factor influencing long-term adoption.

## 6.1 Implications  for  Research

Our study advances theoretical understanding in three ways. First, we contribute to the theory of digital coaching by demonstrating how organizational context influences the effectiveness of AI coaching implementations, especially in highly regulated environments such as public administration. Our findings demonstrate that successful AI coaching integration requires addressing both technical and organizational dimensions, particularly in public administration. Second, it extends the application of AI coaching beyond the educational context to public administration and shows how the DAIC framework [ 37] can be used for self-reflection competence development in public administration. Third, the study shows how evidence-based theories like Korthagen's ALACT model [ 24] can be integrated into AI coaching to effectively guide users' self-reflection.

## 6.2 Implications  for  Practice

The results highlight the practical implications of integrating AI coaching into public administration, emphasizing its scalability and cost-effectiveness as an alternative to traditional coaching while identifying key conditions necessary for successful implementation. Key recommendations for successful adoption include organizational support, such as the creation of clear policies for allocating dedicated time for self-reflective practices during work hours. Additionally, seamless integration of AI coaching into existing internal systems is crucial. This may involve the use of locally hosted AI models and features such as active reminders and calendar integration to minimize barriers and ensure consistent engagement. Finally, addressing concerns around data protection and the 'black-box' nature of AI tools highlights the need for transparent communication about underlying language models, self-reflection frameworks, and data handling practices.

## 6.3 Limitations,  Concluding  Remarks,  and  Outlook

Several limitations should be acknowledged. The evaluation period of two weeks offers only initial insights. A more exhaustive study is recommended to better understand usage and impact. Additionally, our reliance on self-reported competence development could be complemented by more objective measures in future research. The sample size of seven participants limits the generalizability of our findings to the broader public administration context.

Our study highlights both the potential and limitations of AI coaching in fostering self-reflection competences in public administration. The qualitative findings indicate promising benefits by enhancing awareness of self-reflection opportunities and providing guidance for structuring thoughts.

One of the key strengths of AI coaching lies in its ability to provide structured, non-judgmental guidance, which supports users in engaging with self-reflective processes in a consistent and accessible manner. The integration of evidencebased frameworks ensures that ReflectAI follows a structured approach to facilitate meaningful self-reflection. Our findings demonstrate that AI coaching can effectively enhance self-reflective thinking by encouraging users to articulate their thoughts in a structured format, reinforcing prior research on expressive writing and self-reflection in digital environments. At the same time, ReflectAI's limitations highlight the need for continued refinement of AI coaching to improve adaptability and user trust.

Future research should implement long-term studies to evaluate the organizational impact of AI coaching on competence development. Particular attention should be paid to addressing the organizational barriers identified in our study, such as time constraints and technical infrastructure limitations, and to determine how to integrate AI coaching into existing HR development programs. Future research should also explore the application of AI coaching to other competences beyond self-reflection.

Abstract. We focus on explainability as a desideratum for automated decision-making systems, rather than only models. Although the explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) paradigm offers an impressive variety of solutions to increase the transparency of automated decisions, XAI contributions rarely account for the complete systems-social and institutional environments-where models operate. Our work focuses on one such system in the domain of social welfare, which increasingly turns to automated decision-making to carry out targeted digital surveillance. Specifically, we present a case study of a black-box machine learning model previously used in a major Dutch city to support its officials in the task of detecting fraud. Employing analyses established in the field of system safety, we identify five types of hazards that could have occurred after the introduction of the model. For each of them, we reason about the potential value of XAI interventions as hazard mitigation strategies. The case study illustrates how the deployment of models may impact processes that exist far upstream and downstream from their decision logic, making explainability and/or interpretability insufficient to guarantee the systems' safe operation. In many cases, XAI techniques may only be able to reasonably address a small fraction of hazards related to the use of algorithms; several major hazards that we identify would have still posed risks if the system had relied on an interpretable model. Thus, we empirically demonstrate that the values, which lie at the heart of XAI research, such as responsibility, safety, or transparency, ultimately necessitate a broader outlook on automated decision-making systems.

## 1 Introduction

Automated decision-making (ADM)-the use of algorithms to make fully automated decisions or support the decisions of humans [ 6]-is increasingly applied to

IFIP  International  Federation  for  Information  Processing  2026

improve 'efficiency' or 'objectivity' of decisions in highly consequential domains such as the justice system [ 1], public administration [ 22], or healthcare [ 36]. Although regulatory frameworks, including the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act), or (until recently) the United States' Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights , propose to ban fully-automated decisions and require mechanisms for human oversight, it is not yet clear what form these should take. Moreover, as observed by [ 46] in the context of GDPR, policy efforts seek to establish the 'right to explanation' rather than the 'right to interpretable decisions' . This distinction is even clearer in newer regulations, such as the AI Act, which does not outlaw black-box decision-making, instead mandating sufficient explanation standards for automated decisions. Therefore, we can reasonably expect post-hoc explainability solutions to become standard, preferred tools in many domains.

However, post-hoc interventions or human oversight procedures were not enough to prevent high-profile failures of ADM solutions. The Netherlands alone has observed the detrimental impacts of several ADM systems, most notably ones developed to detect social welfare fraud. Firstly, an algorithm employed by the Tax and Customs Administration ( Belastingdienst ) resulted in unjustified fraud accusations against tens of thousands of families, driving many households (deeper) into poverty in the childcare benefits scandal ( toeslagenaffaire ) [ 24]. Secondly, the System Risk Indication ( SyRI ) model established by the Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment to detect potential social welfare fraud at the level of neighborhoods [ 4] was outlawed by The Hague District Court on the grounds that it violated the provisions of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights [ 41]. Thirdly, the Dutch Education Executive Service ( DUO ), in charge of student finance grants, used an investigation model that unfairly targeted students from non-European backgrounds [ 25]. Lastly, the municipality of Rotterdam experimented with a risk profiling model that was found to exhibit biases against vulnerable groups such as migrants or single mothers [ 19].

These cases share three notable characteristics. First, the common goal of detecting fraud in social welfare settings highlights the keen interest of public authorities in making use of algorithms as a surveillance tool. Second, all people who rely on social assistance are in a vulnerable position; algorithms tend to aggravate these social inequalities by disproportionately targeting certain subpopulations. Third, the models were small components of larger sociotechnical decision-making systems . In theory, flawed (e.g., discriminatory) algorithmic predictions could have been filtered out by actors responsible for the operation of these models. However, this did not occur and real-world harms materialized, suggesting the need for a broader lens to describe, understand, and address such 'algorithmic' harms [ 14]. Even though methods have been proposed to conceptualize and analyze AI functions in their sociotechnical contexts [ 15, 44], their applications in social welfare and broader public services are still missing.

The abovelisted failures of ADM systems offer valuable lessons to researchers, practitioners, and policy-makers. Thus, we contribute the first in-depth analysis of a social welfare fraud detection system through a sociotechnical and system-

theoretic lens. We consider the automated fraud detection tool previously used in Rotterdam, looking at the pertinent technical, social, and institutional processes to arrive at a comprehensive description and understanding of possible harms. We pursue desk research (study of existing documents) to inform an empirical analysis of the case and make use of the tools of system safety to identify core harms and their underlying system-theoretic hazard sources [ 28]. Using these insights, we perform a critical analysis of the practical value of XAI solutions in this complex system. In the process, we provide a first-of-its-kind evaluation of the affordances and fundamental limitations of XAI solutions, grounded in a sociotechnical and system-theoretic analysis of an ADM system, within the specific context of social welfare. Our approach showcases how relying on XAI tools is fundamentally incomplete and cannot guarantee their responsible operation. We explain how other forms of interventions are necessary to safeguard vulnerable populations from discrimination when algorithms are employed in high-stakes settings, and point to ways in which similar sociotechnical systemtheoretic analyses can aid in identifying and designing interventions to comprehensively mitigate and eliminate harms. Our contributions are as follows:

- (a) we provide a first in-depth case study of a real-world machine learning model for risk profiling in social welfare, conceptualized as a system of social, technical, and institutional components and processes;
- (b) within the context of this system, we evaluate the affordances and fundamental limitations of XAI , understood as a set of solutions to promote fair, reliable, safe, transparent, and so forth, automated decision-making.

## 2 Background

We begin by delineating the landscape of explainability tools in Sect. 2.1. Then, in Sect. 2.2, we discuss AI solutions as systems with not only technical, but also social and institutional components. Finally, in Sect. 2.3, we look at the application of algorithms in broader public administration.

## 2.1 On Explainability in Artificial Intelligence

'Interpretability' and 'explainability' tend to be used interchangeably in artificial intelligence research, but we follow the distinction from a literature review of [ 32]. The authors explain that interpretability is generally understood as an inherent property of a particular model. In contrast, explainability refers to post-hoc solutions that aim to improve the legibility of decision logic across a variety of models. We center our discussions on explainability to remain faithful to the case study, which looks at a specific system where any attempts to explain model decisions would necessarily need to take the form of post-hoc interventions.

Explainability solutions can be applied to models that would otherwise be completely opaque, but they still attract many well-founded objections. We highlight three particularly relevant critiques. First, they are 'likely to perpetuate

bad practice' [ 46]. Opaque models offer reasonable performance out-of-the-box; coupled with an XAI method, they may give an impression of a well-designed algorithm, detracting from critical design decisions, such as selecting informative features. Second, an explanation may seem superficially reasonable but insufficiently faithful to the logic of the model [ 5], and thus mislead its recipients and promote unwarranted trust [ 5, 16]. Third, explanations should account for contextual factors, such as normative and legal constraints [ 47], social environment and cognitive processes [ 33], or users' technical proficiency [ 13]. Thus, receiving an explanation, receiving a meaningful explanation, and understanding the meaning of an explanation are three different but intrinsically linked challenges.

Various criteria to classify explainability techniques have been proposed in the literature; an unsystematic review from 2022 found 11 taxonomies developed in the three prior years [ 49]. Other than the stage (ante-hoc interpretability vs post-hoc explainability) distinction, the author identified two further criteria considered in all taxonomies: XAI techniques range in scope from local (i.e., explaining individual instances) to global (i.e., explaining the complete decision logic of the model), and in applicability from model-specific (i.e., suitable for one algorithm class) to completely model-agnostic (i.e., suitable for any algorithm). We adapt the taxonomy proposed in Sect. 4.1 of [ 49], which classifies XAI solutions by the type of a problem, the modality of input data, the manner of acting upon a model, the stage, the scope, and the output format. Operating on the level of a taxonomy allows us to comprehensively look at XAI by mixing the characteristics of solutions, rather than discussing individual techniques.

## 2.2 On System-Oriented Approaches to Artificial Intelligence

The concept of artificial intelligence as a tool inherently entangled with its social and institutional environment is not new, but many lines of XAI research are yet to (fully) embrace the sociotechnical understanding of AI. Works that already do, draw on a variety of disciplines, including science and technology studies, ethics and philosophy of technology, or system safety [ 27]. A key aspect of this vision of AI is its explicit recognition that the behaviors of any model are the product of the interactions of the components in their environment [ 44]. As an example, generative AI poses the risk of producing misleading or deceptive information, which turns into a hazard only if, e.g., the model is accessible publicly, and in turn produces harms if, e.g., people act on these incorrect outputs [ 55].

This paradigm promises a way to overcome the blind spots of model-oriented analyses. For example, in the context of AI fairness, [ 48] defined five traps of abstracting away the context of a model, such as the 'ripple effect trap' , where researchers fail to recognize that introducing new technologies into an existing system is bound to influence its dynamics. Additionally, it promotes the operationalization of abstract principles and values such as safety [ 14], which is much more difficult to guarantee with 'alternative' approaches such as AI ethics [ 35].

## 2.3 On Automated Decisions in Public Administration

We look at explainable AI in social welfare, a service of public administration. Although there is little agreement among scholars on what exactly constitutes public administration, its primary objective is widely recognized as the realization of the goals of a government through the implementation of its policies [ 23]. The applications of ADM tools in public administration are hardly a new phenomenon, but their burden on society keeps growing along with their pervasiveness [ 20, 30]. For example, the Netherlands has been algorithmizing its national and local governments for decades (e.g., with rule-based systems) but only recent advances in AI have raised concerns about the impacts of automated decision-making tools on fundamental freedoms and human rights [ 40].

Many challenges for ADM systems have been described in the literature, including safety (unexpected dynamics in operational environments), security (risks of attacks and abuse), privacy (retrieval of information stored in the training data or parameters of a model), fairness (equal treatment of individuals), or explainability [ 9]. As public administration entities operate on sensitive data to decide on a large scale on consequential problems, failing to sufficiently respect and defend these values when automated decision-making systems are in use may provoke questions about the government legitimacy, e.g., [ 22, 45].

Yet, as recognized by [ 52], all forms of data-driven modeling may discriminate against marginalized groups. For instance, digital surveillance methods ( cf. risk profiling) have been observed to predominantly affect vulnerable populations [ 17]. Thus, ADM systems may aggravate power asymmetries inherent to public administration: they create distance between 'those who shape a system' and 'those affected by a system' [ 31], with few accountability mechanisms allowing the latter to achieve meaningful control over algorithmic outcomes [ 31, 38]. At least in principle, XAI solutions could help address this problem.

## 3 Methods

Our case study focuses on a machine learning model that was developed to support the municipality of Rotterdam in the implementation of the regulations laid out in the Participation Act ( Participatiewet ), which defines bijstand , a form of long-term assistance for residents of the Netherlands who are able to work but cannot find employment, and are no longer covered by the national unemployment insurance. According to the law, all municipalities must periodically, but no more frequently than once every two years, re-examine the recipients of bijstand to ensure that benefits remain duly granted. As this form of assistance is implemented at the level of individual municipalities, they may employ various tools to nominate residents for reexamination. Historically, these included random and expert-driven selections [ 3], as well as tips from other residents. According to Statistics Netherlands around five million people in the country receive some form of social support, including bijstand [ 10]; specifically in Rotterdam, 6.1% of residents receive bijstand , the highest percentage in the country. It is perhaps unsurprising that the

decision-makers of Rotterdam, a municipality that actively invests in practically oriented research on responsible digitization, most notably through its Creating010 research centre (e.g., [ 37]), looked towards AI as an approach to enable targeted selection for re-examinations.

To conduct the case study, we employ desk research methods to distill information from publicly accessible sources, and carry out system-theoretic analyses to reason about the hazards-unsafe system states-related to the model. To our knowledge, the fraud detection model employed by the Work and Income (W&amp;I) department was first disclosed in the 'Colored Technology' ( Gekleurde Technologie ) report from 2021 by the Rotterdam Court of Audit, which examined the ethical use of algorithms by the city authorities, following principles such as responsibility, transparency, or fairness [ 42]. The report concluded that on the organizational side, the W&amp;I department failed to satisfy multiple ethical standards, including the lack of clearly assigned responsibility for the complete system, unsatisfactory transparency towards benefit recipients affected by the model decisions, and inadequate motivation for decisions related to ethics [ 42].

Later, in 2023, the model became the centerpiece of a journalistic investigation coordinated by Lighthouse Reports that focused on 'suspicion machines' , or fraud detection tools employed across Europe for social welfare purposes [ 19]. As acknowledged by the journalists, 'out of dozens of cities we contacted, [Rotterdam] was the only one willing to share the code behind its algorithm' . Their work not only revealed that the model was characterized by poor technical performance, but also that it was prone to discrimination against people from vulnerable backgrounds, recommending them for re-examination significantly more often than expected [ 7]. This behavior likely stemmed from the fact that expertdriven selection was used to collect the training data. Hence, some groups of residents may have been overrepresented in the dataset. Although the model was used to make predictions outside of the lab-in 2019 it was used to launch 22% of fraud investigations [ 42]-it never officially left the pilot stage; Rotterdam decommissioned the model in 2021, two years prior to the investigation.

We look at this model for three reasons. First, as informed by The Algorithm Register [ 34], the Dutch national database of algorithms, there is notable interest among public administration organizations to use automated data processing for social welfare. We find that 80 out of 674 algorithms (11.8%) registered by the end of 2024 fulfill this criterion and many of them-28, or (35.0%)-are used for fraud detection purposes. Such algorithms impact millions of people, also outside of the Netherlands [ 19], highlighting the need to improve their safe operations and motivating our study. Second, the Rotterdam model was part of a complex decision-making system, allowing us to discuss the value of XAI solutions in the context of real-world social and institutional processes. Third, the available documents enable us to map the complete system, thus enabling comprehensive system-theoretic analyses. In particular, Lighthouse Reports published 'the holy trinity of algorithmic accountability: the training data, the model file and the code for [the] system' in their GitHub repository [ 7]. We can also learn from the entry about the model in The Algorithm Register, reports of (1) the Rotterdam

Court of Audit that discussed the development and operations of the system [ 42], and (2) Algorithm Audit, a normative advice organization, that looked at the quality of features used by the model [ 3], as well as national and local laws. What distinguishes our contribution is that we evaluate the complete system as it could have been if various explainable AI interventions (in their most optimistic, strongest interpretation) had served as risk mitigation strategies.

We rely on the tools of the Systems-Theoretic Accident Model and Processes (STAMP) framework established in the field of system safety, as proposed by [ 28] and operationalized for AI settings by [ 44]. STAMP aims to mitigate accidents by enforcing (behavioral) constraints on the system. Specifically, we apply a form of Safety-Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) [ 29], one of the STAMP methods that aims to collect 'information about how behavioral safety constraints, which are derived from system hazards, can be violated' , see p. 212 of [ 28].

## 4 Case  Study  of  Automated  Risk  Profiling

We draw the boundaries of the system, and hence our analysis around the operating process: the set of components and activities immediately relevant to the daily operations. We identify them in Sect. 4.1 and map their relationships in Sect. 4.2. This operational lens allows us to reason in Sect. 4.3 about causal scenarios that could potentially drive the system to an unsafe state, based on four types of inadequate control actions distinguished by [ 28] and established in the field of system safety: (1) ones that are never provided or never followed, (2) ones that are provided at the incorrect time, (3) ones that are executed for an incorrect amount of time, and (4) ones that are unsafe. We analyze in Sect. 4.4 if any XAI interventions could eliminate or mitigate these hazardous states.

## 4.1 Stakeholder Analysis

We start by introducing key stakeholders with influence on the daily operations of the system, playing a role in its design, development, and use (i.e., 'actors'):

- (a) Benefit recipients in Rotterdam would expect a re-examination roughly once every six years, if the selection was fully random.
- (b) Consultants are the client-facing professionals in the W&amp;I department. They are responsible for interviewing benefit recipients and storing information about them [ 42], and thus co-created the dataset used by the model.
- (c) Team Testing and Monitoring ( T&amp;T ) provided domain expertise during the development of the model. They were also co-responsible for its operation, focusing on the selection of people for re-examination [ 42].
- (d) Team Reinvestigations ( THO ) is responsible for carrying out the reexaminations of benefit recipients [ 42] based on the inputs from Team T&amp;T.
- (e) Team Research and Business Intelligence ( OBI ) is a research team of the municipality that joined the Accenture team for model development. Later, it took over for the maintenance and operation of the system [ 42].

- (f) Team Complaints is a unit in the W&amp;I department responsible for handling complaints about welfare benefits, e.g., from customers who have not been treated fairly or have not received sufficient information.
- (g) Privacy Officers and Data Protection Officer oversee the handling and protection of personal data. While the former are employed in one of the departments, the latter is an independent officer of the municipality that focuses, among others, on compliance with the GDPR.
- (h) Concern Management of W&amp;I, one of six organizational units in the municipality [ 39], oversees all matters related to the department, including ADM systems. However, the model was developed with the support of another department, so the assignment of responsibility was not clear [ 42]. It further includes three independent units; among these, Concern Auditing that performs audits of systems, processes, and programs.
- (i) College of Mayor and Aldermen is the executive board of a municipality selected by the city council. Its tasks include the establishment of the structure of the municipal organization (also the W&amp;I department) and the nomination of the Concern Management. In Rotterdam, the Alderman responsible for W&amp;I coordinated the schedule (i.e., the number of modeldriven nominations) of re-examinations with the department [ 42].

## 4.2 Operating Process

Our evaluation focuses on the state of the system when the model was in use. The analysis revolves around the controlled process , i.e., some activity of a system that is actively and/or passively guided by a set of controllers [ 29], in this case, human employees and an AI subsystem. The controllers are expected to ascertain the state of the system through feedback channels and, when necessary, enforce behavioral constraints over the system through control channels [ 29], thus realizing or preventing certain outcomes in the controlled process. We present a map of the system in Fig. 1 and discuss it in the next paragraphs.

Controlled Process: Social Assistance Duly Granted. Assistance should be provided to people (1) who need it, (2) who are eligible, (3) at the time when they are eligible, (4) and at the amounts for which they are eligible. The goals are two-fold. Firstly, people who are not (or are no longer) eligible should be reexamined without delay. Secondly, people who remain eligible should not have their privileges unnecessarily suspended during the re-examination. Naturally, the latter depends on the administrative procedures of re-examinations themselves, rather than the procedures of nomination, but we note that minimizing the number of false positive nominations would address this issue.

Human Controller: Employees. Three teams in Rotterdam W&amp;I jointly fulfill the role of the human controller: Consultants, Team T&amp;T, and Team THO. We do not consider Team OBI to control the process-they act as an extension of the W&amp;I teams-but their activities still have an impact on the system.

Automated Controller: AI Subsystem. In principle, the automated controller should impact the controlled process only indirectly because its predic-

tions are supposed to be filtered by humans. However, the analysis of Lighthouse Reports unveiled that model predictions exhibited biases [ 7] but the city still carried out a large number of re-examinations based on the risk scores assigned by the model. This suggests that the AI subsystem had non-negligible direct impacts. The W&amp;I department developed a gradient boosting machine model [ 18] trained on 315 features. Thus, the model predictions could not be readily interpreted, both due to the opaque algorithm and the complexity of the under-

lying data. The features belong to 14 categories, including appointments with the municipality, barriers to reintegration into the workplace, personal characteristics, or relationships. Rotterdam's data scientists calculated the relative importance of all features compared to the baseline of age at investigation . The top 5 features include (1) the age at investigation , (2) the number of existing cost-sharer relationships , (3) the number of no-show appointments , (4) the number of 'applying expertise' competencies , and (5) the number of contacts on the topic of income [ 7].

## 4.3 Scenarios of Inadequate Control

We use the functional control diagram in Fig. 1 to identify actions that may influence the controlled process and trace their potential causal scenarios, which allows us to diagnose five hypothetical scenarios of inadequate control. For each of them, we describe what types of hazards it could produce, how this influences the system, and derive requirements for XAI that ought to be satisfied to (ideally) eliminate or at least mitigate a hazard. As a methodological contribution, we propose to translate between these requirements and the technical promises of XAI solutions by formulating the former using categories from XAI taxonomies (we follow [ 49]). In our case study, certain requirements must hold for all scenarios: we require post-hoc algorithms applicable to tree-based models trained on tabular inputs for a classification task. Other requirements are scenario-specific.

## A. Insufficient data quality ( Unsafe control actions provided )

Description: Two types of unsafe control actions can be identified: (1) the use of uninformative or harmful features, and (2) the collection of substandard or biased data. The 'garbage-in, garbage-out' principle is at play here: nonmeaningful inputs are likely to produce non-meaningful outputs because the model learns spurious correlations rather than constructive patterns in the data.

Impacts: A normative advice commission established by [ 2] proposed a set of eligible and non-eligible profiling criteria in the social welfare setting; the framework includes eight criteria for variables, such as clear 'linkage with aim pursued' , 'subjective' evaluation, or propensity to produce 'proxy discrimination' .

Requirements for XAI: Improve (e.g., address bias) features on a global scale.

B. Erroneous interpretation of outcomes. ( Control actions never provided ) Description: (1) domain experts are expected to intervene on the outcomes of the model, but it can be reasonably expected that some interventions cannot be enforced due to the model's complexity; (2) the model does not provide any explanation of its decisions, which may make objections impossible.

Impacts: Employees may be able to apply simple interventions, e.g., exempting (groups of) people from the re-examination. More complex actions, such as identifying and acting on model biases, are difficult without an understanding of the decision logic and model statistics. Additionally, a non-interpretable model does not contribute to organizational knowledge, e.g., by suggesting fraud patterns.

Requirements for XAI: Elucidate the decision logic of the model on both local (as justification for benefit recipients) and global (as explanation for the decisionmakers) scales. The former constrains the output format to explanations that are legible for non-expert users (e.g., natural language rules or descriptions).

C. Weak transparency standards. ( Control actions never provided )

Description: Benefit recipients were not informed if an investigation was started following a model-driven nomination, see p. 42 in [ 42]. It is unclear if the reinvestigation officers were aware of the applied selection tools.

Impacts: Transparency wrt. the selection is necessary for the reinvestigation officers to identify wrongful nominations and evaluate the model, and for the benefit recipients to exercise their rights. Sufficient transparency standards towards data subjects are required by GDPR Art. 13(2)f, 14(2)g, and 15(1)h.

Requirements for XAI: Inform recipients (on a global scale, with individual explanations) about the reason why a fraud investigation was launched.

D. Unreliable handling of complaints. ( Control actions at incorrect time )

Description: Benefit recipients may be reluctant to file complaints. Introducing a model further increases complexity in this step: it is technically challenging (for non-experts) to argue about the unfairness of model-driven nominations.

Impacts: Social welfare benefits are necessary for the fulfillment of recipients' basic needs, which discourages complaints. Therefore, control signals may be delayed relative to the moment when harms begin to occur.

Requirements for XAI: Ensure that individuals ( local scale) unhappy with an automated decision have access to meaningful interventions to achieve more favorable outcomes. For XAI solutions, this would entail (1) output formats that alleviate the burden of complaint procedures (e.g., rules ), or (2) result types that enable the recipients to control the process (e.g., feature relevance ). Especially in case (2), these insights should be actionable and provably improve outcomes . Additionally, citizens will need (human) assistance, in particular to comprehend complex ADM-driven decisions, and understand and exercise their rights.

E. Imprecise model feedback. ( Unsafe control actions are provided )

Description: A negative outcome of an investigation-'no fraud'-should increase trust in a benefit recipient. Repeated and excessive re-examinations not only can be considered prejudiced, but also entail ineffective use of resources. Yet, some benefit recipients were examined multiple times while the model was in use [ 8]. Signals on the trustworthiness of individuals (both 'fraud' and 'no fraud' outcomes) may also follow from random and expert-driven nominations.

Impacts: Without external interventions, a sufficiently 'well-trained' model can be expected to target the same individuals multiple times when their features remain relatively stable. Thus, some benefit recipients may be unfairly targeted even after an earlier investigation established no wrongdoing.

Requirements for XAI: Safeguard all individuals (i.e., global scale) from unnecessary repetitious investigations, especially when the features and the decision logic do not change substantially between nomination periods.

## 4.4 Affordances and Constraints of XAI in Social Welfare

Finally, we reason about the ability of various XAI solutions to mitigate or eliminate the identified hazards by satisfying derived requirements. In our analysis, we consider the strongest, most optimistic form of XAI solutions to identify what types of hazards could never be addressed with these types of interventions.

## A. Insufficient data quality

Given that the model already exists, we are looking for post-hoc interventions, but the requirements must be satisfied for all input data, which directly contradicts our goals. Still, the W&amp;I department periodically retrained its model so we can also consider ex ante interventions. Feature selection has been a consideration in XAI research (e.g., [ 57]), but the quality of input data in the case study is primarily an administrative problem. For example, the top-50 most relevant features include a number of criteria that have been argued by [ 2] to be inappropriate for profiling; problems such as 'subjectivity' or 'linkage with the aim pursued' are domain-specific and cannot be resolved in a fully automated manner. Similarly, expert advice is generally needed to decide whether a feature could be considered a legitimate proxy for protected attributes. Even though Rotterdam developed tools to evaluate its model on disparate impact metrics, these were never actively applied by the operators [ 7]. Moreover, the model exhibited biases against groups described by multiple features. The 'single mother' archetype analyzed by [ 7] integrates ∼ 5 features; even simple 2-feature archetypes in a dataset of 315 features already lead to at least 49455 possible combinations of features. Thus, we believe that XAI tools cannot sufficiently address the challenges of data quality, but they may encourage decision-makers to reflect on the inputs.

## B. Erroneous interpretation of outcomes

This problem is arguably most directly relevant to the interests of XAI research as it relates to the explanation of the decision logic. Several solutions could meet the needs of decision makers. First, they could simplify the model with global surrogates, but this approach is counterproductive in that an explanation can never be completely faithful to the original model [ 46], bringing into question the utility of a non-explainable model in the first place. Second, they could evaluate the interactions of features with techniques such as partial dependence plots [ 18]; however, with 315 features, they are again only able to consider a small subset of all potential interactions. Third, they could focus on the instances with the strongest influence of the model (e.g., prototypes and criticisms [ 26]). Although such approaches do not explain the decision logic, they may uncover instances that require special attention from model operators, such as vulnerable groups. These three options cover all forms of results described in the taxonomy of [ 49].

We also look at explainability towards benefit recipients. XAI research typically points to counterfactual explanations (CEs) as a way to help non-experts understand the grounds of decisions and act upon them [ 53, 54]. However, when we evaluate the utility of CEs for the Rotterdam model, we observe, e.g., that the algorithm of [ 54] produces highly impractical CEs that impact up to 70 features.

## C. Weak transparency standards

This scenario relates to an organizational process, so XAI tools are not relevant. However, transparency about selection methods is a necessary but not sufficient prerequisite to explainability, e.g., for people to request information about the involved logic. A sociotechnical understanding of the broader process is required to ensure observability [ 28, 43] in order to analyze this task and its outcomes.

## D. Unreliable handling of complaints

Although the handling of complaints is again an organizational process, XAI interventions may contribute to mitigating the hazards. In particular, we look to algorithmic recourse (AR), the provision of actionable recommendations [ 50, 53], as an idea that could satisfy the requirements. AR could encourage and empower benefit recipients to control the process because certain behaviors that affect risk scores can be reasonably expected from them (such as attending appointments or fulfilling information duty). It could also serve as an indirect encouragement to file complaints. Notably, these qualities would remain true if the decisions of an interpretable model were provided along with recourse recommendations.

## E. Imprecise model feedback

The requirements for this setting do not fit neatly into the taxonomy of [ 49] because they generally require an intervention on the model rather than an explanation of its decisions, which already suggests that XAI solutions may be unhelpful here. Still, we reason about this scenario more broadly to decide on the value of some related approaches. First, the municipality could further decouple predictions from decisions [ 51] by introducing an alternative, stricter classification threshold for individuals who have been previously re-evaluated, which would discourage the repeated nomination of benefit recipients. Still, moving thresholds does not safeguard individuals whose features spuriously lead to high risk scores, and a more transparent administrative solution would be simpler and preferred for accountability reasons. Second, the municipality could introduce small random perturbations into the dataset to counteract the problem of stable input features leading to the same outputs. However, unless explicitly framed as adversarial examples [ 21], random noise would not predictably impact the predictions. The adversarial examples approach is counterproductive as it entails a situation where decision-makers are attempting to fool their own model. Furthermore, both solutions increase complexity in this scenario, defeating the purpose of an explainable approach. Thus, ultimately, XAI solutions cannot meaningfully address this challenge and the interventions must occur at different stages of the process. For example, decision-makers could evaluate the frequency of investigations as part of human-in-the-loop filtering (which was in

place in Rotterdam). Alternatively, as repeated investigation may remain meaningful if different factors contribute to the two decisions, the municipality could retrain its model on different subsets of features every year. Although feature selection was part of the pipeline, we were unable to establish to what extent the decision-makers modified the features year-to-year.

## 5 Discussion

We begin by discussing the implications of the Rotterdam case study for research on explainable artificial intelligence as a safety mechanism in Sect. 5.1. Next, we address the generalizability of our findings to other decision-making contexts in Sect. 5.2. Finally, we address the shortcomings of our work in Sect. 5.3.

## 5.1 Explainable AI as a Safety Mechanism

In light of the 'right to explanation' legislation, we believe that research on XAI solutions remains important. However, our work highlights that explainability may have far-reaching fundamental limitations when considered to address reasonable issues understood as safety hazards. We explicitly discourage reading this work as a discussion of the 'current shortcomings of explainable artificial intelligence' or as an overview of the 'challenges for the future'. Rather, our goal was to demonstrate that certain hazards related to the deployment of automated decision-making tools in safety-critical domains can never be mitigated with XAI because hazards can emerge within stages of decision-making processes that are not directly influenced by the logic of a (black-box) model.

We identified five scenarios related to the use of a risk profiling model that could produce hazards. Even in the most optimistic interpretation-with faithful, meaningful, and so forth explanations-XAI could reasonably mitigate only two of them. The other hazards call for (non-technical) interventions elsewhere in the process. Inherently interpretable models cannot be expected to fully eliminate the identified hazards either. Once more, this issue arises because Rotterdam relied on 315 features, making the predictions of even the simplest logistic regression models inscrutable, especially to non-expert benefit recipients.

Our case study empirically demonstrates the need to shift 'from explainable algorithms to explainable processes' and 'from an instrumental to an institutional approach' previously recognized by [ 13]. The authors formulated seven general strategies for policy-makers to improve the acceptance of XAI methods; we postulate that these extend to practitioners who are ultimately responsible for the operations of any system and to researchers who should be aware of the affordances and limitations of their contributions. This work is a step towards operationalizing the strategies of [ 13] through an effective method to reason about the value of XAI interventions in (and tailor them to) specific domains.

## 5.2 Explainable AI in Other Contexts

Naturally, our findings are context-specific: potential hazards are functions of the actors, technologies, and processes involved in a system. We explain why many hazards related to ADM systems can never be reasonably mitigated with technical XAI interventions, but reliably generalizing these findings requires, e.g., repeated analyses in different decision-making systems. Still, our work showcases the applicability of system-theoretic process analysis (STPA) to reason about the potential hazards, the value of XAI solutions, and their limitations in a granular and systematic manner. Promoting these values makes our approach an effective complement to and extension of simpler (in application) auditing tools such as the Oracle Test [ 11]. Future work may take up these implications to inform sociotechnical and system-theoretic approaches for integrating XAI techniques.

Even in the specific context of social welfare, the ability to generalize our findings depends on various characteristics of public administration entities, such as their willingness to automate decision-making, their approaches to responsible development of technologies, or their prior experience with algorithms. Notably, public administration in the Netherlands tends to be efficient, stable, and lowconflict. Municipalities that actively invest in the development of ADM systems (such as Rotterdam or Amsterdam) tend to introduce safeguards on the process and embrace accountability [ 56]. Thus, the Dutch landscape of public administration offers, in many ways, a highly favorable setting for the introduction of novel algorithmic solutions. Yet, as showcased by our case study and other failures introduced in Sect. 1, even in this optimal 'testing ground', algorithms can act to the detriment of vulnerable populations and undermine the authority of public administration entities. Therefore, this evaluation of the fundamental limitations of techno-centric XAI solutions can be considered as a cautionary tale for decision-makers interested in the development and deployment of ADM tools, especially when their solutions would be applied in less 'predictable' systems.

Finally, we recognize that tools of system safety are themselves not neutral [ 14] because any map of a system imposes a subjective view that promotes certain power relationships [ 12]. Thus, it is necessary to exercise extreme caution already at the stage of system design, e.g., by inviting the perspectives of diverse stakeholders and employing alternative analyses to reduce the blind spots.

## 5.3 Limitations of the Current Work

We must stress three limitations of this work. First, we evaluate an 'external' case without the involvement of its owners. As our request for an interview with the experts from the Rotterdam W&amp;I department was not accepted, our analyses fully rely on evidence from high-quality publicly available sources. This should not impact the validity of our arguments in a significant way, but it means that the decision-making system depicted in this work may be a simplification of reality. Second, relatedly, our analysis is not fully objective. This is a common shortcoming of STPA-like approaches because they necessitate certain design decisions [ 44]. For example, the analyst must decide on the system boundary, the

relevant interactions between components, or the scenarios of inadequate control. We make our best effort to motivate all of these choices, but it is possible that other authors would arrive at slightly different conclusions. Finally, we decide to follow the taxonomy of [ 49] to reason about XAI interventions because it was developed as a comprehensive reinterpretation of earlier efforts. Nevertheless, as also recognized by the author, different (forms of) analyses may be best served by different taxonomies, and other choices were possible.

## 6 Conclusions

We carried out a case study of an automated decision-making system used for risk profiling in social welfare. Building on earlier works that integrate systemtheoretic analyses into the evaluation of AI systems, we applied taxonomy-level reasoning as a method to decide on the value of XAI interventions in specific contexts, and demonstrated its effectiveness in the discussion of five scenarios of inadequate control derived in the case study. Our analysis highlights important fundamental limitations of XAI in that many hazards related to the deployment and use of a model may emerge at other stages of the decision-making process. As a consequence, such hazards cannot be readily mitigated by enhancing the interpretability of algorithmic decisions. This is not to say that XAI solutions are seen as a panacea; as we discuss, many of their drawbacks are well documented. Rather, we believe that with the growing recognition of the 'right to explanation' and without an in-depth understanding of the systemic affordances and limitations of XAI, and practical methods to reason about them, such solutions may all too easily become a way to ethics-wash poorly designed ADM systems.

Abstract. The growing  complexity  of  public sector governance  in the digital era  demands  a  fundamental  rethinking  of  how  services  are  designed,  delivered, and  governed.  Co-creation  has  emerged  as  a  central  paradigm,  promoting  collaboration  between  governments,  citizens,  and  diverse  stakeholders  to  improve inclusiveness  and  responsiveness.  In  parallel,  the  integration  of  digital  technologies,  particularly  AI  and  data-driven  approaches,  is  reshaping  the  competencies required  in  public  administration.  These  developments  bring  not  only  new  technical  expectations  but  also  raise  ethical,  regulatory,  and  sustainability  challenges. This  study  examines  how  such  interdisciplinary  demands  are  reflected  in  public sector  labor  markets  through  a  comparative  case  study  of  Poland  and  Ukraine  two  countries  actively  undergoing  public  sector  digital  transformation,  but  situated  within  different  political  and  institutional  contexts.  Based  on  an  analysis  of 120  job  vacancies,  we  examine  required  knowledge  areas  and  skill  sets  across six  dimensions:  Co-creation,  Ethics,  Evidence-based  decision-making,  Sustainability,  AI,  and  Legal  &amp;  Regulation.  Our  findings  highlight  notable  differences between  the  two  cases  -  Poland's  stronger  orientation  toward  participatory  governance  and  Ukraine's  emphasis  on  digital  and  AI  transformation.  At  the  same  time, the  analysis  reveals  substantial  gaps  in  the  articulation  and  integration  of  crosscutting  competencies,  underscoring  the  need  for  systemic  investment  in  workforce development  and  interdisciplinary  education  aligned  with  emerging  public  sector challenges.

## 1 Introduction

Digital  technologies  are  reshaping  how  governments  interact  with  citizens  and  deliver services,  creating  new  opportunities  for  responsiveness,  transparency,  and  citizen  participation [1, 2]. Across  Europe  and  beyond,  the public sector is shifting  from  topdown  service  delivery  to  more  collaborative  governance  models,  where  citizens  are  seen not  only  as  recipients  but  as  active  contributors  to  public  service  design  [3].  This  has sparked  growing  interest  in  co-creation  -  multi-actor  processes  that  involve  stakeholders throughout  the  design,  implementation,  and  evaluation  of  public  policies  [4,  5].  However,  in  practice,  co-creation  is  often  fragmented,  and  limited  to  consultation  or  basic communication.  Simultaneously,  there  is  increasing  pressure  for  policy  to  be  evidencebased  and  data-informed  [6].  The  rise  of  digital  data  and  AI-enabled  tools  has  expanded opportunities  for  innovation,  but  also  introduced  challenges,  including  algorithmic  bias, ethical  risks,  and  concerns  about  transparency  and  public  trust  [7].  Addressing  these issues  requires  a  redefinition  of  public  sector  competencies,  with  stronger  emphasis  on inclusiveness,  responsibility,  and  interdisciplinary  skills  [8].

This paper investigates how  public  sector job profiles articulate interdisciplinary competencies  required  for  AI-enabled  co-creation,  with  the aim of  identifying  emerging skill  demands  at  the  intersection  of  digital  innovation,  citizen  engagement,  and  evidencebased  policymaking.  Through  a  comparative  analysis  of  60  job  vacancies  from  Poland and  60  from  Ukraine,  we  explore  how  differing  administrative  contexts  express  competency  needs  across  the  domains  of  co-creation,  digital  transformation,  and  AI.  Poland, as  an  EU  member  state  with  established  digital  governance  frameworks,  and  Ukraine, an  EU  candidate  undergoing  rapid  digital  reform,  offer  a  meaningful  contrast.  The  study addresses  three research questions :  RQ1:  What  knowledge  areas  are  required  for  AIenabled  co-creation  in  the  public  sector?  RQ2:  What  types  of  interdisciplinary  skills  are expected,  and  how  are  they  distributed  across  cognitive  levels?  RQ3:  What  job  roles reflect  the  demand  for  interdisciplinary  competencies  in  AI-enabled  co-creation?

We  conducted  a  qualitative  and  text-mining  analysis  of  public  sector  job  descriptions, analyzing  role  descriptions  and  competency  expectations.  Job  positions  were  categorized into  three  domains  -  AI  and  Data  Science,  Digital  Transformation,  and  Societal  Engagement  -  and  competencies  were  coded  across  six  key  dimensions:  Co-creation,  Ethics, Evidence-Based  Decision-Making,  Sustainability,  AI,  and  Legal  &amp;  Regulation  [9].  This study contributes a  structured  approach  to  identifying  emerging  skill  requirements  in  the public  sector,  reveals  key  gaps  in  the  integration  of  co-creation  with  digital  and  AI  practices,  and  offers  practical  guidance  for  workforce  planning  and  curriculum  development in  public  administration.

## 2 Background

## 2.1 AI-Enabled  Co-Creation  for  the  Public  Sector

With  growing  societal  complexity,  increasing  citizen  expectations,  and  limited  public resources,  public  sector  organizations  (PSOs)  face  mounting  pressure  to  improve  the quality, inclusiveness, and responsiveness of public services [1, 2]. Traditional topdown  models  of  service  delivery  are  no  longer  sufficient.  Instead,  public  administrations

are  undergoing  a  paradigm  shift  that  views  citizens  not  merely  as  service  recipients, but  as  active  participants  in  shaping  policies  and  co-producing  services  [10-12].  This shift  has  led  to  growing  interest  in co-creation processes  -  multi-actor  collaborations that  span  all  stages  of  policy  and  service  development,  from  co-commissioning  to  codesign,  co-delivery,  and  co-assessment  [3].  While  these  participatory  approaches  are gaining  traction,  they  also  raise  important  ethical  and  social  concerns.  Power  asymmetries,  unequal  access  to  digital  tools,  and  differences  in  stakeholder  capabilities  may  limit who  can  participate  and  how  [13,  14].  Meaningful  inclusion,  particularly  of  vulnerable groups,  remains  a  key  challenge,  as  does  the  need  to  ensure  fairness,  transparency,  and legitimacy  in  collaborative  processes.

At  the  same  time,  policy  decisions  are  increasingly  expected  to  be evidence-based . The  growing  availability  of  data,  from  administrative  records  to  citizen-generated  content,  offers  new  opportunities  to  inform  public  decision-making.  Yet  the  ability  to  analyze  and  meaningfully  interpret  such  data  requires  new  institutional  capacities,  including digital  literacy,  data  governance,  and  analytical  expertise  [6,  15].  Parallel  to  this, sustainability has  become  a  core  public  value.  It  is  no  longer  limited  to  environmental  issues but  encompasses  economic,  institutional,  and  social  dimensions  of  resilience  and  longterm  impact.  In  this  sense,  sustainability  requires  not  only  outcomes  that  endure  over time,  but  also  participatory  and  adaptive  processes  that  align  with  the  needs  of  diverse communities  [16-18].

A  significant  driver  of  transformation  is  the  integration  of  digital  technologies,  especially  Artificial  Intelligence  (AI),  into  public  sector  innovation  [8].  AI  systems  promise  to improve  efficiency,  enable  real-time  service  responsiveness,  and  enhance  public  engagement  [4,  15].  However,  their  use  also  introduces  challenges  related  to  data  representativeness, algorithmic  bias, explainability, and trust [19, 20]. Ethical frameworks  and standards  for  data  governance  are  therefore  essential  to  ensure  that  AI  applications  serve the  public  interest  and  are  socially  responsible.  These  advances  call  for  a  reevaluation of the legal and regulatory frameworks  that  underpin  digital governance.  As  public services  become  increasingly  data-driven  and  AI-supported,  legal  clarity  is  needed  to ensure  accountability,  protect  rights,  and  guide  institutional  responsibilities.  Regulatory adaptation  plays  a  crucial  role  in  balancing  innovation  with  democratic  values  and  societal  well-being  [21].  Together,  these  interconnected  shifts  toward  co-creation,  ethical, evidence-informed,  sustainable,  AI-enabled,  and  legally  grounded  governance  highlight a pressing need to rethink public  sector  competencies . Addressing  these challenges requires  a  workforce  equipped  not  only  with  domain-specific  expertise  but  also  with interdisciplinary  and  cross-functional  skills. As  such, public sector job profiles  must evolve  to  reflect  the  knowledge,  cognitive  abilities,  and  behavioral  attributes  necessary to  operate  effectively  within  this  emerging  landscape  [8].

## 2.2 Public  Sector  Digital  Transformation  in  Poland  and  Ukraine

Poland  and  Ukraine  were  selected  for  this  analysis  due  to  the  several  reasons:  1)  their active engagement  in  public sector digital transformation, 2) their distinct positions within  the  broader  European  digital  governance  landscape,  and  3)  deep  familiarity  to  the researchers.  While  Poland  operates  within  established  EU  digital  policy  frameworks,

Ukraine  -  an  EU  candidate  country  -  has  rapidly  advanced  its  digital  agenda.  This  contrast  provides  a  meaningful  basis  for  comparing  how  digital  competencies  and  innovation priorities  evolve  in  centralized  versus  reform-driven  public  administrations  [22,  23].

Digital  transformation  has  accelerated  significantly  in  both  countries,  especially  in public  service  delivery  and  institutional  modernization.  In Ukraine ,  the  introduction  of the  Chief  Digital  Transformation  Officer  (CDTO)  role  in  2020  marked  a  pivotal  shift [24]. As of 2024, 18 regions have appointed  official  CDTOs,  overseeing  more  than 250  digital  transformation  projects,  including  40  planned  for  2024.  Moreover,  90%  of territorial  communities  have  access  to  Administrative  Service  Centers,  and  84%  have introduced  electronic  appeals  [24].  These  advances  are  supported  by  Ukraine's  Digital  Transformation  Index  for  Communities,  which  measures  development  in  five  areas: digital  economy,  skills,  infrastructure,  public  services,  and  local  governance.  Notably, digital  skills  and  public  services  receive  the  highest  weighting  (25%  each),  signaling national  priorities.  Ukraine  has  further  aligned  its  digital  governance  with  EU  benchmarks  through  the  adoption  of  DESI  indicators  based  on  EU  methodology  [25].  These reflect  core  areas  such  as  infrastructure,  skills,  business  digitalization,  and  e-government. Ukraine's  global  standing  in  digital  capabilities  has  risen:  according  to  Coursera's  Global Skills  Report  (2023),  94%  of  its  population  possesses  digital  competencies  [26].  In  the 2024  UN  e-Government  Development  Index,  Ukraine  rose  to  30th  place  globally  (a + 16  improvement  since  2022),  highlighting  rapid  progress.  The  'Diya'  portal  provides citizens  with  access  to  over  130  public  services  online,  which  simplifies  interaction  with public  authorities  and  increases  the  transparency  of  processes.  Thus,  despite  the  military operations  in  Ukraine,  the  Ministry  of  Digital  Transformation,  regional  state  administrations  are  working  to  improve  and  expand  the  range  of  digital  services  provided  to citizens.  In  turn,  Ukrainian  citizens  see  the  need  to  acquire/improve  digital  skills  both for  work  and  everyday  life.

Poland ,  has  faced  more  persistent  challenges  in  developing  digital  human  capital. In  2022,  it  ranked  24th  out  of  27  EU  countries  in  DESI  [22],  with  only  43%  of  citizens demonstrating  basic  digital  tool  use  and  57%  possessing  content  creation  skills.  ICT specialists  also  comprise  a  slightly  smaller  portion  of  the  workforce  than  the  EU  average.  While  progress  has  been  steady,  Poland  still  trails  in  cloud  services,  big  data,  and  AI adoption.  Its  digital  public  service  provision  in  2022  remained  below  EU  average  levels, limiting  its  readiness  to  meet  the  Digital  Decade  target  of  100%  online  services  by  2030. Nonetheless,  Poland  is  advancing.  The  Ministry  of  Digitalization  resumed  its  activities in  2023,  followed  by  the  release  of  a  Digitalization  Strategy  targeting  2035  [27].  Goals include  equipping  85%  of  citizens  with  basic  digital  skills,  fully  digitizing  administrative workflows,  and  centralizing  digital  services  through  the  mObywatel  application.  Poland also  signed  a  cybersecurity  cooperation  agreement  with  Ukraine  [28]  and  actively  participates  in  the  EU's  'Digital  Europe'  program  [29].  Open  data  remains  a  national  strength: in  2021,  Poland  ranked  4th  in  the  EU  for  Open  Data  Maturity,  scoring  95%  (EU  average: 81%).

Despite  advances  in  digital  governance  and  service  delivery,  one  critical  area  remains underdeveloped  in  both  countries:  co-creation.  While  public  consultation  and  communication  with  citizens  are  increasingly  promoted,  job  profiles  and  strategic  frameworks seldom  reflect  a  systemic  integration  of  co-creation.  Especially  when  it  intersects  with

AI,  data  science,  and  evidence-based  policymaking.  This  gap  underscores  the  importance  of  investigating  the  interdisciplinary  competencies  needed  to  support  AI-enabled co-creation  in  the  evolving  digital  public  sector.

## 3 Methodology

## 3.1 Competency  Taxonomy  Framework

To  guide  our  comparative  analysis,  we  adopted  a  two-level taxonomy for  classifying knowledge  areas and skills derived from public sector job vacancies in Poland and Ukraine. This taxonomy  was  informed  both  by  central to  contemporary  public  sector  transformation:  Societal  Engagement  [10,  30],  Digital  Transformation  [31,  32],  and AI  &amp;  Data  Science  [7,  19]  -  reflecting  the  technological,  organizational,  and  participatory dimensions  of  modern  public  administration;  and  prior  research  on  public  sector  innovation  and  co-creation  [9],  where  six  dimensions  were  conceptualized  as  foundational to  AI-enabled  co-creation  in  evidence-based  policymaking.

Competency Categories - Domains of Public Sector Transformation. At  the  first  level, we  defined three broad competency categories that  reflect  the  strategic  domains  through which  innovation  and  transformation  are  currently  unfolding  in  the  public  sector:  (1) Societal engagement (SE),  encompassing  citizen  interaction,  participatory  policymaking,  social  inclusion,  and  collaboration  between  governments  and  communities;  (2) Digital  transformation (DT), including smart city development,  digital service delivery, ICT  project management,  and  the  integration of digital technologies in  governance; (3) AI and Data scienc e  (AI&amp;DS),  focusing  on  competencies  related  to  data  governance, AI  development  and  deployment,  algorithmic  accountability, and data-driven decision-making.

Competency Dimensions - Cross-Cutting Areas of Capability. At the second  level, we  organized  the  extracted  knowledge  and  skills  into  six cross-cutting dimensions [9] that represent thematic capability areas necessary across all three domains:  (1) Cocreatio n (CC)  -  collaborative  design,  delivery,  and  evaluation  of  policies  or  services involving  multiple  stakeholders;  (2) Ethics (E)  -  awareness  and  application  of  fairness, transparency,  accountability,  privacy,  and  inclusiveness  principles  in  public  service;  (3) Evidence-based decision-making (EBDM)  -  collection,  analysis,  and  application  of  data and  research  to  inform  strategies  and  actions;  (4) Sustainability (S)-  integration  of  environmental,  economic,  and  social  sustainability  principles  into  policy  and  service  design; (5) AI -  technical  and  applied  knowledge  of  artificial  intelligence,  including  development,  implementation,  and  risk  mitigation;  (6) Legal &amp; Regulation (L  and  R)-  understanding and application of legal frameworks,  compliance  requirements, and policy regulation  mechanisms.

## 3.2 Data С ollection  Strategy

We  conducted  a two-fold search strategy across three key domains  of public sector transformation. First ,  we  conducted  a  targeted  search  of  job  vacancies,  using  thematic

keyword  sets  for  each  competency  category:  (1)  'public/social  consultation,'  'participation,'  'social  dialogue,'  'co-creation,'  'co-decision,'  and  'policy  development'  related to SE category;  (2)  'digital  services,'  'smart  city,'  'sustainable  development,'  'AI  governance,'  and  'e-government'  related  to DT category;  and  (3)  'artificial  intelligence,' 'data  analytics,'  'computer  science,'  'responsible  AI,'  and  'AI  ethics'  related  to AI and DS category.  In Ukraine ,  these  included  municipal  career  pages,  UN  job  boards,  and online  recruitment  platforms 1 . In Poland ,  we  relied  on  national  recruitment  portals 2 . The  data  collection  period  covered  vacancies  posted  between  2023  and  2025.

Second , recognizing that interdisciplinary roles, particularly those related to  cocreation,  are  not  always  explicitly  labeled  in  job  postings,  we  complemented  the  vacancy search with  an  analysis  of  departmental  mandates  and  scopes  of  activity.  We  examined organizational  units  at city and  state  levels  (e.g.,  departments  within  City  Halls and  central  agencies)  whose  missions  and  ongoing  projects  align  with  co-creation  and citizen-centred  public  sector  innovation.  This  allowed  us  to  contextualize  individual  job roles  within  broader  institutional  efforts  and  identify  competencies  relevant  to  the  cocreation  framework,  even  if  not  stated  directly  in  the  job  advertisement.  In Ukraine ,  these included  governmental  portals  (e.g.,  NADS,  Ministry  of  Digital  Transformation,  private companies  providing  services to government  agencies  or ministries). In Poland , we relied  mostly  on  official  city  websites,  public  administration  job  boards,  and  municipal 3 pages  from  cities  such  as  Warsaw,  Gdynia,  Gda ń sk,  Kraków,  Wroc ł aw,  and  Katowice, among  others.  A  detailed  list  of  collected  data  is  part  of  the  supplementary  material 4 ,5 .

Our  goal  in  this  step  motivated  by  data  availability  not  to  collect  recurring  instances of  the  same  position  but  to  gather  a  representative  range  of  distinct  job  profiles  reflecting the  breadth  of  roles  relevant  to  co-creation  and  digital  innovation  in  the  public  sector.  Job titles  were not duplicated ,  even  if  multiple  postings  for  similar  positions  existed,  ensuring diversity  of  roles  over  volume.  The  final  dataset  included  60  unique  job  vacancies  from Poland  and  60  unique  job  vacancies  from  Ukraine.  We  provide  the  exact  number  of vacancies  to  ensure  better  comparability  for  countries.

## 3.3 Data  Analysis

First ,  to  identify  the knowledge areas embedded  in  the  vacancy  descriptions,  the  analysis was  aligned  with  the  two  initial  cognitive  levels  of  Bloom's  taxonomy  -  remembering and  understanding  [33].  Using  part-of-speech  tagging  and  n-gram  analysis,  we  extracted knowledge  verbs  such  as  ' know '  and  ' understand '  and  paired  them  with  associated objects  [34].  To  ensure  the  validity  of  the  categorization  and  interpretation  process,  we involved  domain  experts  with  diverse  backgrounds,  including  policy  analytics,  computer  science,  e-government,  citizen  engagement,  and  digital  competencies.  Redundant or  infrequent  terms  appearing  only  once  across  the  corpus  were  excluded.  As  a  result,  we

identified  a  set  of  core  knowledge  areas  for  each  country. Second ,  the  identified  knowledge  areas  were  grouped  by  three  experts  into  three  overarching competency categories , reflecting  their  role  in  public  sector  transformation.  This  step  ensured  a  coherent  conceptual  structure  while  acknowledging  overlaps  across  domains. Third ,  to  capture  the higher-order  skills  embedded  in  the  vacancies,  we  extended  the  analysis  to  the  next  four levels  of  Bloom's  taxonomy  apply , analyze , evaluate ,  and create [33].  Skill  phrases were  extracted  by  combining  cognitive  verbs  with  domain-relevant  objects.  These  skill expressions  were  contextually  validated  by  four  experts  through  iterative  review  to  ensure consistency  with  the  job's  stated  responsibilities.  The  result  was  a  set  of  skills  reflecting the  cognitive demands  of  public  sector  innovation  roles. Each  skill  was  tagged  with the  corresponding  Bloom  level  to  assess  the  distribution  of  complexity  and  expected autonomy  in  task  performance. Fourth ,  all  extracted  knowledge  areas  and  skills  were mapped  to  a  conceptual  framework  reflecting  six  co-creation-related  cross-cutting  areas of  capability.  This  thematic  mapping  was  CONDUCTED  manually  by  four  domain experts  who  reviewed  the  extracted  content  and  categorized  each  element  accordingly. Ambiguities  were  resolved  through  consensus,  ensuring  alignment  with  the  analytical framework  introduced  by  [9].  Fifth,  a  comparative  analysis  was  conducted  between  the Polish  and  Ukrainian  datasets  to  identify  similarities,  divergences,  and  country-specific emphasis  within  each  of  the  six  themes.  The  comparison  was  structured  at  two  levels: (1)  the  distribution  and  nature  of  knowledge  areas,  and  (2)  the  diversity  and  cognitive complexity  of  skill  requirements.

## 4 Results

## 4.1 Knowledge  Areas  for  Ai-Enabled  Co-Creation  in  Public  Sector

This  section  answers  the  research  question RQ1. What are the knowledge areas required for AI-enabled co-creation in the public sector? We  conducted  a  detailed  mapping  of the  extracted  knowledge  areas  against  (i)  six  interrelated  competency  dimensions , and (ii) across three competency  categories  (innovation  domains).  In  total, we  identified 87  distinct  knowledge  areas  appearing  at  the  remembering  and  understanding  levels  of Bloom's  taxonomy.  Out  of  these,  49  were  considered core ,  appearing  more  than  once and  with  relevance  in  both  countries'  datasets.  These  were  extracted  through  a  combination  of  keyword-based  annotation,  contextual  expert  coding,  and  cross-validation  of job  description  content.

Based  on  our  analysis,  the  following  distinct  patterns  in  three  competency  categories were  revealed. AI &amp; Data Science . In this category, competencies  related  to AI and EBDM  were  the  most  emphasized  in  both  countries.  In Poland ,  31.4%  of  the  competencies  in  this  domain  were  linked  to  these  two  dimensions  (AI:  9.9%,  EBDM:  8.3%,  L&amp;R: 6.6%).  The  majority  of  roles  focused  on  AI  governance,  data  infrastructure,  visualization  tools,  and  risk  analytics,  underpinned  by  strong  references  to  regulatory  frameworks like  GDPR,  ISO  certification,  and  Open  Data  standards.  In  contrast, Ukraine showed  a slightly  broader  distribution,  with  AI  (8.8%),  EBDM  (7.4%),  and  L&amp;R  (5.1%)  together accounting  for  over  21%  of  all  competencies,  but  also  included  a  greater  emphasis  on practical  implementation  and  automation,  such  as  machine  learning  models,  AI-driven governance,  and  administrative  automation.  Notably,  Ukraine  had  explicit  references  to

co-creation-oriented  AI  use,  including  AI-driven  citizen  participation  tools  and  stakeholder workshops,  which  were  not  observed  in  Polish job descriptions. Shared  core knowledge  areas  include:  data  analytics,  AI  governance,  regulatory  frameworks,  and data  protection.

Societal Engagement. This  category  revealed the most  diverse and context-specific understanding  of  public  sector  competencies.  In Poland ,  co-creation  practices  such  as public  consultations,  participatory  budgeting,  and  civic  dialogue  were  widely  embedded  into  roles,  along  with  attention  to  urban  sustainability  and  social  inclusion  laws. Ukrainian vacancies  emphasized  community  interaction,  provision  of  citizen  services, and  ESG  reporting,  suggesting  a  more  administrative  or  service-oriented  framing  of engagement.  In  terms  of  ethics,  both  countries  addressed  governance  transparency  and social  ethics,  but  Poland  focused  more  on  conflict  resolution  and  inclusive  governance in  participatory  research.  Evidence-based  competencies  such  as  project  evaluation  and policy  reporting  were  common  in  both  countries,  although  Ukraine  showed  more  emphasis  on  public  information  rights  and  gap  analysis  in  governance.  Shared  core  knowledge areas  include:  evaluation  of  social  projects,  sustainability  advisory,  and  legal  frameworks for  citizen  participation.

Digital Transformation. This  category  shows  a  strong  overlap  between  the  two  countries, particularly in terms of technical governance,  smart  city integration,  and  datadriven  public  service  innovation.  Both  contexts  highlighted  the  need  for  regulatory  alignment,  such  as  procurement  law  and  digital  service  compliance. Polish vacancies  placed greater  emphasis  on  digital  infrastructure  design,  energy  efficiency  in  digital  services, and  legal  design  of  e-services,  pointing  toward  long-term  urban  and  institutional  transformation  strategies. Ukrainian job  descriptions  prioritized  cybersecurity,  automation  of public  services,  regulatory  adaptation,  data  privacy,  and  compliance  standards.  Shared core  knowledge  areas  include:  Smart  City  development,  digital  service  co-creation,  IT project  management,  digital  sustainability,  and  regulatory  compliance  in  e-governance.

Figure  1  presents  the  distribution  of  core  knowledge  areas  across  the  three  overarching  competency  categories 6 -  and  their  six  associated  competency  dimensions 7 .  These categories  and  dimensions  collectively  reflect  the  multidimensional  nature  of  AI-enabled co-creation  in  the  public  sector,  capturing  the  interplay  between  technological  innovation,  participatory  governance,  and  institutional  accountability.  Across  both  Poland  and Ukraine, Societal Engagement emerged  as  the  most  prominent  category,  comprising 43.9%  of  competencies  in  Poland  and  41.9%  in  Ukraine.  However,  this  category  showed a  strong  presence  in  co-creation  (10.7%  in  Poland;  8.8%  in  Ukraine),  EBDM,  and  L&amp;R competencies,  while  being  notably  weak  in  the  AI  dimension,  indicating  a  gap  in  aligning civic  engagement  roles  with  digital  innovation. Digital Transformation accounted  for 35.7%  of  Polish  and  33.8%  of  Ukrainian  competencies,  reflecting  growing  attention  to  egovernment,  smart  city  infrastructure,  and  data-driven  service  modernization.  Within  this category,  AI-related  and  Evidence-Based  competencies  were  more  pronounced,  yet  the Ethics  and  Sustainability  dimensions  remained  relatively  underrepresented,  highlighting the  need  for  more  integrated  and  responsible  digital  development  approaches. AI &amp; Data Science was  the  least  represented  category  overall  (Poland:  20.4%,  Ukraine:  24.3%),  and

exhibited  a  narrower  internal  structure.  While  competencies  related  to  AI  governance, data  infrastructure,  and  regulatory  compliance  were  common,  the  dimensions  of  Cocreation,  Sustainability,  and  Ethics  were  sparsely  addressed.  This  fragmentation  points to  a  prevailing  disconnect  between  AI  innovation  and  participatory  design:  AI-related roles  tended  to  focus  on  automation,  cybersecurity,  or  compliance,  while  participatory roles  lacked  digital  or  data-driven  components.

## 4.2 Core  Skills  for  Ai-Enabled  Co-Creation  in  Public  Sector

This  section  answers  the  research  question  RQ2.  What  types  of  interdisciplinary  skills are  expected  for  AI-enabled  co-creation,  and  how  are  they  distributed  across  cognitive levels?  We  conducted  a  structured  mapping  of  59  unique  skill  expressions  drawn  from vacancies  in  Poland  and  Ukraine.  These  were  categorized  under  six  core  competency dimensions  and  classified  by  cognitive  level  using  Bloom's  Taxonomy  (Apply,  Analyze, Evaluate, Create). A summary  of  the  skills extracted for each country  is part of the supplementary  material 8 .

The Co-creation dimension  accounted  for  24%  of  all  identified  skills.  Within  this category, the  majority  of  activities  were  at  the  Apply  (42.9%)  and  Analyze  (35.7%) levels.  Typical  tasks  included  coordinating  consultations,  supporting  local  engagement, and  facilitating  participatory  governance.  A  smaller  portion  required  Evaluate  (14.3%) or  Create  (7.1%)  level  competencies,  such  as  collaborative  innovation  and  partnership

development. Ethics contributed  10%  of  total  skills.  Most  skills  were  concentrated  at the  Apply  (50%)  and  Analyze  (33.3%)  levels,  dealing  with  fairness,  data  protection,  and inclusive  governance.  Evaluate  (16.7%)  level  tasks,  such  as  assessing  bias  or  ethical  standards  in  AI,  were  more  common  in  Ukrainian  roles. Evidence-based decision-making was  the  most  cognitively  diverse  category,  comprising  22%  of  all  skills.  Nearly  half  of the  tasks  (45.5%)  spanned  all  three  levels  -  Analyze,  Evaluate,  and  Apply  -  including data  reporting,  impact  analysis,  and  performance  monitoring.  Create  skills  (9.1%)  were observed  in  predictive  analytics  and  strategy  design.  The Sustainability category  made up  12%  of  identified  skills.  Most  activities  were  distributed  across  Analyze  (35.7%)  and Evaluate  (35.7%)  levels,  such  as  ESG  assessments,  environmental  planning,  and  compliance  auditing.  Create  (14.3%)  and  Apply  (14.3%)  tasks  were  less  frequent  but  appeared in  climate  policy  development  and  implementation. AI represented  15%  of  skills,  with high-level  cognitive  engagement.  Create-level  competencies  appeared  in  33.3%  of  AIrelated  tasks  (e.g.,  designing  AI  governance  models),  while  Analyze  (33.3%)  and  Evaluate  (22.2%)  covered  system  monitoring,  cybersecurity,  and  compliance.  Apply  level skills  (11.1%)  included  basic  AI  deployment  and  data  management.  Lastly, Legal &amp; Regulation accounted  for  17%  of  all  identified  skills.  The  majority  of  tasks  fell  within the  Analyze  (41.2%)  and  Evaluate  (35.3%)  levels  -  compliance  review,  legal  analysis, and  monitoring.  A  smaller  share  (11.8%)  was  required  to  Apply,  and  only  11.8%  reached the  Create  level,  where  drafting  legal  frameworks  and  policy  documents  was  expected.

Table 2 presents the consolidated  list of skills for AI-enabled  co-creation  in the public  sector,  derived  from  job  vacancies  in  Poland  and  Ukraine  and  categorized  under six  competency  dimensions  (Dim.).  Each  skill  is  mapped  against  four  cognitive  levels from  Bloom's  taxonomy  [33]  to  reflect  the  complexity  of  tasks  associated  with  each competency  [34].  Skills  sharing  identical  combinations  of  cognitive  levels  within  the same  competency  dimension  were  grouped  into  single  cells.

## 4.3 Public  Sector  Job  Positions  for  AI-Enabled  Co-Creation

This  section  answers  the  research  question RQ3. What job roles reflect the demand for interdisciplinary competencies in AI-enabled co-creation? To  complement  the  analysis

of  knowledge  areas  and  skill  dimensions,  we  examined  the  range  and  diversity  of  public  sector  job  positions  associated  with  each  of  the  three  core  competency  categories. Importantly,  the  job  positions  were  derived  using  two  complementary  approaches:  (1) directly advertised  job  vacancies,  collected  from  official  national  and  city-level  recruitment  platforms  in  Poland  and  Ukraine;  (2) inferred roles  based  on  the  functional  mandates  of  relevant  departments,  as  described  on  institutional  websites  and  administrative structures  (e.g.,  departments  dedicated  to  social  participation,  public  consultations  and co-decision  with  residents,  or  cooperation  with  residents).  The  summary  of  job  positions is  part  of  the  supplementary  material 9 .

The distribution of job positions across competency categories reveals distinct country-specific  trends  (see  Fig.  2).  In Poland ,  Societal  Engagement  dominates  (66%), reflecting  an  institutional  emphasis  on  participatory  governance,  civic  dialogue,  and  cocreation.  However,  a  significant  portion  of  roles  within  this  category  were  inferred  from departmental  scopes  and  mandates  rather  than  identified  through  explicitly  advertised job postings. Moreover,  these  departments  are  often concentrated  in  central  municipal  structures,  such  as  city  halls  of  major  urban  areas.  In  contrast, Ukraine presents  a more  balanced  distribution,  with  Societal  Engagement  (42%)  and  Digital  Transformation (40%)  playing  nearly  equal  roles,  and  AI  &amp;  Data  Science  slightly  higher  than  in  Poland (18%).  Notably,  many  of  Ukraine's  Societal Engagement  job  titles, such as  specialists  in  information  support,  citizen  appeals,  and  digital  service  coordination,  emphasize communication,  administrative  processing,  and  technical  facilitation  of  digital  public services.

The  compiled  job  roles  were  grouped  under  three  main  categories,  enabling  a  comparative  analysis  between  countries. AI &amp; Data Science . In  both  countries,  this  category  was  characterized  by  specialized  technical  roles,  though  with  distinct  emphases.  In Poland ,  roles  focused  predominantly  on  data  acquisition,  management,  and  governance, reflecting  institutional  interest  in  open  data  practices  and  regulatory  compliance.  Notable positions  included  Specialist  in  Data  Analysis  and  Acquisition,  Data  Management  Specialist, Open  Data Specialist, and AI Governance  Specialist. In contrast, Ukrainian job titles reflected a stronger implementation  and systems development  orientation, such  as  Machine  Learning  Product  Analyst,  Data  Architect,  and  AI  &amp;  Data  Analytics  Lead.  Ukraine  also  featured  positions  involving  multi-stakeholder  collaboration  and co-creation  through  AI  tools,  which  were  not  observed  in  the  Polish  dataset.

Societal Engagement. This  category  presented  the  broadest  and  most  diverse  spectrum  of  roles  in  both  countries.  Such  roles  ranged  from  public  consultation  and  civic engagement  to sustainable urban development  and  social  communication,  including positions  such  as  Specialist  in  Strengthening  Local  Community,  Participation  and  Dialogue  Specialist,  and  Social  Projects  Specialist.  Many  roles  explicitly  referenced  interdisciplinary  coordination,  citizen  participation,  and  policy-related  cooperation  with  NGOs. In Ukraine ,  job  titles  within  this  domain  focused  more  on  administrative  service  provision,  citizen  information  access,  and  regulatory  monitoring.  Examples  include  Inspector of  the  Appeals  Processing  Department,  Administrator  of  the  Administrative  Services Center,  and  Governance  and  Services  Expert.  A  subset  of  roles,  such  as  Senior  ESG Consulting  Expert  and  Senior  Sustainability  Consultant.

Digital Transformation. This  category  exhibited  the  highest  degree  of  overlap  between countries  in  terms  of  both  technical  and  managerial  roles.  In Poland ,  a  variety  of  positions  linked  to  Smart  City  development,  digital  product  management,  and  e-Government systems  were  present.  Examples  included  Smart  City  Projects  Specialist,  Digital  Services  Implementation  Specialist,  and  Coordinator  of  the  Digital  Services  Development Team. Ukraine's job  roles  showed  a  similarly  high  concentration  of  positions  related  to  IT infrastructure,  automation,  and  digital  service  delivery.  Job  titles  such  as  Chief  Specialist of  Digital  Transformation  and  Information  Support,  Head  of  the  Digital  Transformation Department,  and  GovTech  Full  Stack  Developer  indicate  a  national-level  investment  in digital  capacity  building  and  IT  modernization.

## 5 Discussion  and  Conclusions

This  study  aimed  to  explore  how  interdisciplinary  competencies  required  for  AI-enabled co-creation  are  reflected  in  public  sector  job  vacancies,  using  Poland  and  Ukraine  as comparative  case  studies.  Grounded  in  a  two-dimensional competency taxonomy framework comprising three public sector transformation categories and six  competency dimensions, and structured through Bloom's  taxonomy,  our analysis  examined  how interdisciplinary  knowledge  and  skills  are  articulated  within  the  public  sector  contexts.

The  study contributes to the emerging  literature on public sector  transformation and interdisciplinary capacity building by operationalizing the notion of  AI-enabled co-creation  through  a  structured  framework.  Drawing  on  a  previous  conceptual  model [9],  we  advanced  the  understanding  of  how  interconnected  areas  -  such  as  ethics,  legal

compliance,  and  sustainability  -  interact  with  AI  and  citizen  engagement  within  the public  sector  ecosystem.  Responding  to  RQ1  ' What knowledge areas are required for AI-enabled co-creation in the public sector? ',  several  critical  gaps  were  identified:  (1) disjointed  representation  of co-creation competencies,  when  many  postings  referenced tasks  like  communication  or  consultation  but  rarely  used  terms  such  as  'co-creation'  or 'co-decision';  (2)  while  technical AI and  data  roles  were  present,  integration  with  public participation  or  ethics  was  nearly  absent;  (3) legal and ethical competencies  appeared inconsistently  and  were  often  isolated  from  digital  or  AI  contexts,  typically  framed  as compliance  rather  than  proactive  governance  design;  (4) sustainabilityrelated  competencies  were  visible  in  areas  like  energy  efficiency  or  urban  planning,  but  sustainability rarely  appeared  as  an  integrated,  cross-cutting  concern  across  digital  or  participatory roles.

Responding  to  RQ  2  ' What types of interdisciplinary skills are expected, and how are they distributed across cognitive levels? '  this  study  o  offers  a  methodological  contribution  by  proposing  an  approach  to  identifying  interdisciplinary  competencies  required for  AI-enabled  co-creation  in  the  public  sector.  This  study  introduces  a two-dimensional taxonomy for  analyzing  interdisciplinary  public  sector  competencies.  The  first  dimension  reflects  three  transformative  domains  central  to  contemporary  public  administration:  Societal  Engagement,  Digital  Transformation,  and  AI  &amp;  Data  Science.  The  second dimension  draws on the conceptual model  of AI-enabled co-creation, identifying  six  competency  areas  foundational  to  evidence-based  policymaking:  Co-Creation, Ethics,  Evidence-Based  Decision-Making,  Sustainability,  AI,  and  Legal  &amp;  Regulation. Responding  to  RQ  3  ' What job roles reflect the demand for interdisciplinary competencies in AI-enabled co-creation? 'we  applied  a  two-way  data  collection  strategy  that combined  (1) direct analysis  of  job  vacancies  and  (2) interpretive analysis  of  department descriptions  from  public  sector  institutions.  This  allowed  us  to  capture  both  explicitly stated  roles  and  more  latent,  context-embedded  competencies.

Our  research  provides  a practical contribution by  informing  both  recruitment  practices  and  curriculum  development:  (i)  for  public  sector  employers,  the  findings  underscore  the  need  to  move  beyond  task-based  job  descriptions  and  explicitly  articulate  competencies  related  to  co-creation,  such  as  stakeholder  engagement,  participatory  design, and  data-informed  collaboration;  (ii)  for  educational  institutions,  the  study  highlights critical  yet  underrepresented  areas  in  existing  public  administration  and  digital  governance  study  programs.  These  include  the  integration  of  AI  tools  in  participatory  processes,  the  legal  and  ethical  frameworks  for  co-designed  services,  and  the  use  of  data science  to  support  inclusive,  evidence-based  policymaking.

Future  research can expand  this approach  in  several directions: (1) applying  the same  methodology  in  other  EU  countries  could  help  develop  a  more  comprehensive competency  map  for  digital  governance;  (2)  surveys,  interviews  or  workshops  with  hiring departments  would  deepen  understanding  of  why  certain  skills  are  (or  are  not)  featured in  job  postings,  and  how  interdisciplinary  tasks  are  actually  performed  in  practice;  (3) building  on  the  gaps  identified  here,  future  work  could  propose  and  evaluate  educational interventions  that  better  integrate  AI,  ethics,  and  participation  into  public  administration training.

Abstract. The digital governance landscape is increasingly complex. In the European Union, where numerous strategies, legislations and instruments trickle down to the level of Member States, the policy mix yields a picture that is hard to discern. Based on a mapping exercise, we propose a three-dimensional framework for digital governance interventions. The framework is inductively developed based on workshops and expert interviews and features three dimensions: pillars of digital governance, levels of policy interventions, and digital technologies. The proposed framework is dynamic in its propensity to grow in the depth of pillars and levels of interventions, as well as to consider additional technologies. We evaluate it ex ante by applying it to three technologies. Drawing on interviews with policy practitioners, we conclude that the value provided by the framework is in its capacity to reduce complexity, to make sense of a term that has become overly vague and diffuse over time, and to apply it to identify 'white spots'.

Keywords: Digital governance ≤← Digital technologies ≤← European Union ≤← Sovereignty ≤← Competitiveness

## 1 Introduction

The mass adoption of digital technologies has expanded the possibilities for the transfer of information and knowledge [ 53]. But it has also brought about forms of 'platforms' [ 48] and 'surveillance' [ 60] capitalism, as well as 'intellectual monopolies' [ 44]. The global, interconnected nature and rapid rise of digital technologies, paired with the dominant role played by multinationals, has made digital governance increasingly necessary, while at the same time challenging the notion of what digital governance actually stands for and looks like in practice.

<!-- image -->

We use the definition of governance as formulated by the United Nations [ 52]: 'the exercise of political and administrative authority at all levels to manage a country's affairs'. Digital  governance , then, refers to the governance of information and communication technologies and their ability to automate control, coordination, incentives and trust, specifically [ 23].

Social media platforms, artificial intelligence, online identity, and the metaverse are recent examples that require us to rethink and (re-)design policy interventions for governance. That is given that the ubiquitous nature of the digital world has 'created new ways in which human societies produce and distribute risk, and introduced new forms of incalculable uncertainties into everyday life' [ 8]. Generative AI is a paradigmatic case in the list of digital technologies that challenges our societies and economies to their core [ 14]. In addition to the emergence of new technologies, complexity in digital policy making has increased as a result of present geo-political pressures.

The European Union's policy landscape that has emerged in response to these developments is multi-faceted. The same holds for policy landscapes of its Member States, with national policies developing in different directions, scopes, and at varying speeds [ 22]. Here, a complex picture emerges between various governance interventions (i.e. regulations, funding instruments, etc.) [ 46]. Complexity in policy is not necessarily bad, as complex policies are the price of inclusive democratic decision making [ 26]. However, complexity and fragmentation in policy carry negative side effects that can influence the original purpose and efficiency of governance.

To untangle this complexity we propose a three-dimensional dynamic and open-ended framework as coordinate-system to which digital governance (DG) interventions can be mapped. On the basis of two workshops [ 40, 49] and three expert interviews [ 36], the framework is inductively developed. We evaluate it ex ante through a set of interviews with two practitioners responsible for portfolio on digital policy. The framework features three dimensions: (x) pillars that make up DG, (y) levels of policy interventions, and (z) digital technologies. We apply the framework to the DG landscape of the European Union (EU) -with a focus on three technologies, artificial intelligence (AI), distributed ledger technology (DLT), and digital identity, and draw conclusions on its validity and value.

This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 introduces the state of the art research on DG. Section 3 describes the research design. Section 4 presents the three-dimensional framework. Section 5 is the application of the framework to a set of digital technologies. Section 6 discusses implications for research and practice. In Sect. 7 we conclude with an outlook.

## 2 Background

In the literature, the term governance gained prominence towards the end of the twentieth century. The common usage of the term comes from its application 'to a wide range of issues, relationships, and institutions' [ 52]. Conceptually, Pierre and Peters [ 42] distinguish between definitions that are society-, State-, and organisation-centric. Within the scope of this work, we take the broad

conceptualisation introduced by the United Nations [ 52] and primarily focus on the State-centric view that asserts the state as playing a 'leading role, making priorities and defining objectives'. Effectively, governance as the notion that the state is 'steering' both society and economy through legislation, financing, standards, diplomacy, stakeholder engagement, etc. [ 41]. In that sense, this paper does not focus on how the government uses technology or how it interacts with citizens using technology.

The digital transformation has brought with it ample opportunities for economic growth. However, and in particular when faced with disruptive technological assemblages, the 'digital' comes with a heightened degree of uncertainty and risk [ 5, 8]. When looking to govern the symptoms caused by disruption, the ability to respond and adapt -both in terms of time and available interventions -is pivotal [ 28]. The State, in the face of continuous waves of technological disruption, may be facing a Sisyphean task. The stakes are high: failure to govern the digital transformation jeopardises public trust, resilience, and societal cohesion [ 9, 34, 50]. As a consequence, scholars have dedicated themselves to the topic of digital governance (DG) at varying levels of analytical depth and in adopting different epistemologies.

## 2.1 Related  Work

Zittrain [ 59] emphasize that DG has in the past decades shifted from an initial focus on the positive potential of digitalisation (connectivity, innovation, etc.), to the negative sides (surveillance, disinformation, etc.). This change reflects a broader shift from an optimistic to a pragmatic rhetoric where, ideally, the potential and risks of digitalisation ought to be carefully weighed prior to intervention [ 54].

Yet both the potential and the risks of digital technologies are subject to interpretation, shaped by the underlying values and philosophies of those assessing them. Thus, when exploring different models of digital governance, O'hara and Hall [ 39] offer four approaches supported by respective actors: the Silicon Valley open Internet model that promotes transparency, openness, and scalability; the European model which focuses on privacy protection, market competition, and protection of fundamental rights; the authoritarian model, led by China, which uses surveillance for social cohesion and security; and the US Republican model that treats the Internet as private property. While this categorization may be somewhat reductive, it still captures key tendencies and highlights that digital governance can take many forms. Moreover, these models also emphasise the geopolitical and competitive side if digital governance, with each region competing to shape the Internet. In this paper, we focus on the European model, which, with its emphasis on regulation, rights protection, and institutional oversight, offers the most active approach to DG.

Moving away from geopolitics and the actor-centred perspective, Dawes [ 11] take a socio-technical systems approach to DG in order to highlight the dynamic interplay between society, technology, and government. They present a framework that accounts for evolving infrastructures, information management, and

stakeholder interactions, which comes closer to our endeavour than most of the existing work on DG, as their framework is not restricted to just one specific technology. Notably, their work critiques the dominant instrumental focus of DG, which emphasizes efficiency and technical systems, by calling for more normative, value-oriented approaches that address the societal purpose and institutional complexity of digital governance, which similarly aligns with our approach. This paper, however, now over 15 years old, rather predates current developments in EU-level regulation and lacks engagement with the state-led governance efforts that we know in the EU. Our work builds on this foundational perspective by examining how contemporary digital governance strategies in the European context can be understood by taking into account both technological development, democratic values and societal objectives.

As mentioned above, there is also a solid body of academic literature that does take into account the perspectives of technological development, democratic values and societal objectives but rather focuses on one specific technology. For completeness, we will outline some if this work in the following. The first set of literature, for instance, considers AI. Here, Wirtz et al. [ 57] propose a risk-based model to DG that links risks to corresponding mitigation guidelines. Effectively, their view treats DG of AI as a structured risk management process. Attard-Frost et al. [ 3] take a policy-analysis approach and provide a semi-systematic assessment of existing Canadian AI DG initiatives. Their work maps the distribution of DG efforts across different sectors, identifying a focus on innovation, research, and public administration. Their analysis highlights gaps and imbalances in DG priorities, and identifies areas where further interventions are needed.

For blockchain and DLT, Tan et al. [ 51] approach governance as a multilevel decision-making process. Their framework identifies key decision areas, emphasizing how governance is embedded within the technology itself. Unlike the DG of AI, which focuses on risk mitigation, institutional governance, or policies, the authors highlight the technical governance choices shaping DLT. Their model also addresses complexity by showing how DG decisions across different levels must align for effective implementations in the public sector.

Existing approaches tend to be narrow in scope focusing on a single digital technology or a specific case study. Our research is motivated by this lack of an encompassing framework that captures the full range of practical strategies and governance approaches adopted by governments and institutions in the digital realm. Rather than isolating AI, blockchain, or digital platforms as stand-alone topics, we aim to adopt a wider lens. Specifically, we see a need for an analysis of the diverse policy instruments and strategic initiatives within the EU across various technological and regulatory domains. This broader perspective is essential not only for identifying best practices but also for uncovering gaps in the governance framework, or what we might call white spots.

## 2.2 Research  Gap

What our review of related works further revealed to us are two recurring themes in DG that further motivate our research: increasing fragmentation

[ 7, 39], and growing complexity [ 7, 29, 39]. These two themes are complemented with the expectation that additional digital technologies will constantly emerge and require a dynamic take on DG.

Complexity remains a frequently discussed topic in the literature on DG. In public administration, complexity is conceptualized in terms of (1) textual sophistication and (2) ties to and between interventions (i.e. regulations, instruments, etc.) [ 46]. In the context of the digital, we may expand complexity to also be influenced by (3) the State's multifaceted role as an actor that simultaneously uses, regulates, and promotes technology [ 34]. The EU's DG landscape illustrates this heightened complexity on all three levels. This partially stems from the EUMember State relationship, where policies must be adapted to national needs, while also being developed, additionally or even in juxtaposition, at the regional or local level [ 22, 26].

While complexity itself is not inherently problematic, and every democratic entity needs to face complexity in every DG layer, its combination with institutional fragmentation, knowledge gaps, and with the speed and scale of interventions adopted in the EU presents unique challenges. The EU already has numerous interventions in place, but it must foster synergies across its policies. As Codagnone et al. [ 10] recognize, a coherent technology policy map is needed to integrate industrial, digital, and competition strategies. Without realistic goals, balanced instruments, sufficient funding, and expertise, even the most strategic approach to effectively 'govern' the digital risks to fail living up to its promises and targets. This motivates our effort to untangle the various ways DG unfolds in Europe.

## 3 Research  Approach

The research approach taken in this work is qualitative and inductive [ 24]. The data collection and analysis was performed independently by two of the three authors in the context of a project funded by a proxy of the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs. Developed over four consecutive phases, the core contribution of this research is a conceptual framework [ 27].

Phase I (Conceptualisation). As a starting point for our framework, we conceptualised pillars and intervention levels in DG, along with policy priorities, capacities, and strategies set out by the European Commission. To achieve this, we conducted a comprehensive policy analysis that considered several key (sets of) documents: the European Commission's annual Work Programmes (under Von der Leyen, 2019-2025); Von der Leyen's Political Priorities (2019, 2024); the EU Digital Strategy ( Shaping  Europe's  Digital  Future ); the Digital  Compass Communication (2021) and, the Digital  Decade Policy Programme (2021).

Phase II (Development). The framework development process - and the identification of dimensions plus respective characteristics - parallels that of a typology or taxonomy [ 4]. Three consecutive steps were followed:

1. Generation : The first iteration of the framework was generated in a workshop ( W 1 , January 2025) consisting of eight participants from the Platform Applied ICT Research (PRIO). The basis of the workshop was the policy analysis conducted previously. Workshops are commonly used for inductive research [ 40, 49]. The output of the workshop was consensus on the three dimensions of DG; pillars, intervention levels, and digital technologies.
2. Iteration : After W 1 , a set of three open-ended interviews [ 43] was conducted with governance and regulation experts of the Dutch Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO). Interviews with experts -considered as agents with implicit and factual knowledge -are typically consulted in inductive research [ 36]. Extensive notes were taken for each of the interviews. The second workshop ( W 2 , February 2025), consisting of five participants from the Dutch Research Council (NWO), was used to identify and agree upon the exact elements (characteristics) of each dimension. In this step, to iterate upon and challenge the framework in-development, amongst authors we repeatedly met until reaching consensus over the final framework [ 32].
3. Validation : We validated the framework with a second set of open-ended interviews [ 43]. They were conducted with one civil servant from the Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture &amp; Science (OCW) and a policy advisor.

All interviews were held via video conference and lasted around 45 min on average. Each interview was recorded and subsequently transcribed.

Phase  III  (Application). We apply the framework in the policy landscape of the EU with a focus on three digital technologies (on the z-axis): AI, DLT, and digital identity. Given the complexity and fragmentation of the EU's landscape, we limit ourselves to applicable legislations -extracted from Zenner et al. [ 58] as part of the European Commission's priorities 'A Europe fit for the digital age'. To complement this dataset, the authors conducted desk research and checked for completeness with the documents reviewed in the conceptualisation (Phase I) as well as the second set of interviewees. The selection of mapped interventions is used to demonstrate the framework 'in action'. Future work shall encompass a more comprehensive and complete set of interventions.

Phase  IV  (Evaluation). The open-ended interviews [ 43] with the civil servant (Interview 4) and policy advisor (Interview 5) were also used to evaluate the proposed framework. We extracted quotations from the transcripts and report on these in the discussion as part of the contributions to practice.

## 4 Three  Dimensional  Framework

The framework we propose to map DG interventions features three dimensions with respective characteristics. The interventions can be mapped onto a landscape in terms of x-y-z coordinates along three axes such that:

- x: We consider four pillars of DG; values-driven and responsible, sovereignty and strategic autonomy, competitiveness and growth, as well as sustainability.
- y: We consider three categories of interventions to DG; notably, strategies, legislation, and instruments.
- z: We consider the digital technologies to which the interventions apply: AI, DLT, digital identity, and so forth. This dimension is open-ended in terms of characteristics as the framework may account for other digital technologies in the future.

Effectively, the framework developed is a coordinate system to map interventions. It is dynamic and open-ended in its propensity to account for additional dimensions and characteristics. In particular, we see this for the x-axis (additional, more granular pillars) and z-axis (additional technologies). Characteristics on the y-axis are mutually exclusive; those on the x- and z-axis are not. We created visualisations, presented as part of the application (Sect. 5), using the data visualisation tool SharpCloud. The framework is addressed to scholars and policy-makers alike. It assists in reducing complexity of the 'bigger picture' of digital governance.

## 4.1 Pillars  of  Digital  Governance

DG features four conceptual pillars. These four pillars are not mutually exclusive; instead, a strategy for DG may be driven by one, two or more of these pillars. The pillars are mapped on the x-axis in no particular hierarchy.

First, DG encompasses the responsible alignment of technology with public values -including human rights as enshrined into the law as well as the public interest of a given society [ 19]. This means that DG is about more than just managing technology; it is about ensuring that technology is responsibly developed and used in a way that reflects and upholds the societal, ethical and cultural standards of the people it serves [ 2]. It is a commitment to adhere to human rights and integrate principles like fairness, transparency, and accountability into the digital landscape, so that technological progress does not come at the expense of societal well-being.

Second, DG can be motivated by desires of increased sovereignty and the need for strategic autonomy amidst a globalized reality [ 18]. In an era where digital infrastructure is as critical as physical infrastructure, countries are seeking to assert greater control over digital technologies-even resorting to technology as geopolitical levers [ 15, 20, 45]. The drive for control is about having the agency to make independent decisions regarding legislations, policies and practices across the entire digital technology layers [ 47], which is essential for maintaining national security, protecting citizens' data, and fostering independence [ 21].

Third, and related to the former pillar, DG is tied to innovation, competitiveness, and (regional) development. Robust governance of digitalisation (along with active institutions) acts as stimulus for growth [ 33]. This involves not only regulating the digital market to ensure fair competition but also investing in

skills, human capital, and innovation capacities [ 15]. By doing so, regions can become fertile grounds for entrepreneurship, attracting investments and talent -ultimately, nurturing competitiveness and contributing to regional development [ 35]. Most recently, this aspect of DG was discussed by Mario Draghi [ 12].

Fourth, DG considers sustainability in relation to the digital transformation. As the digital world expands, so does its environmental footprint and the use of natural resources. DG must include strategies for minimizing the ecological impact of technology [ 25]. This could involve promoting energy-efficient data centres, encouraging the recycling and responsible disposal of electronic waste, and supporting the development of green information and communication technologies [ 31, 38]. By addressing these issues, DG can help ensure that the digital transformation is environmentally sustainable.

## 4.2 Policy  Interventions

When considering a digital technology, policy interventions can aim for more than just the application or infrastructures itself. Policy interventions consider the socio-technical materiality of the digital -including the stakeholders, innovation ecosystems, priority, etc. They are designed so as to target at one or more layers of the digital technology stack [ 47]. Some interventions may be targeted at organisations specifically (in the EU, consider the Digital Markets Act) or instead, at a given layer of digital technology stack (in the EU, under the Important Projects of Common European Interest). Provided the scope and conceptual granularity [ 4] of this paper, we consider three 'levels' of policy interventions: strategies, legislation, and instruments. These are mapped on the y-axis.

On the highest level we feature strategies. In the EU, these are set every five years by the Commission and they flag political priorities. Since, in our understanding, strategies lay out the overall vision for governance, we place them at highest level. At the time of writing, the main strategy of relevance to digital technologies is provided by the Digital Decade. Then, we feature legislation. Legislation typically presents a direct, top-down vector to intervene [ 16]. Because they are more concrete than strategies, but typically guided by them in they are the frameworks of putting the visions into practice, we locate them at the medium, or second level. On the lowest level we feature instruments (including funding, mechanisms, etc.). As opposed to legislation, which lays out the rules one needs to comply with, instruments act as an enabler [ 1]. These are the most flexible forms of intervention, and most effective at the local or regional level though with limited effects on the global DG landscape.

## 4.3 Digital  Technologies

There are a multitude of digital technologies at which policy interventions are targeted. These can be mapped on the z-axis. For Phase III - Application, we consider AI, DLT, and digital identity.

AI uses algorithms and vast amounts of data to recognize patterns, automate processes, and enhance efficiency in various industries, including healthcare, finance, and customer service [ 13]. Digital identity refers to the online representation of an individual, organization, or device, consisting of unique identifiers such as usernames, biometrics, cryptographic keys, and personal data [ 56]. DLT is a technology that records transactions securely and transparently across multiple nodes. Each block in the chain contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, making it tamper-resistant and highly secure [ 30]. As digital technologies, each of these are on the agenda of the European Union and part of the digital governance ambitions.

## 5 Application  to  the  European  Union

Digital governance in the EU involves a complex interplay between its institutions and member states, aiming to establish a cohesive regulatory framework for the digital economy, data protection, and cybersecurity. While the EU sets overarching interventions, Member States retain a degree of autonomy in adapting and enforcing policies at the national level, leading to a dynamic relationship between centralized governance and national interests [ 39]. This relationship being outside of the scope here, we instead opt to take an outward look on the EU and Commissions' take on digital governance (see also the documents considered in Phase I of Sect. 3).

We opt to present the visualisations for the three selected technologies on two dimensions, considering the x- and y-axis. The three visualisations are presented in Fig. 1a-1c. For all three visualisations we observe that each features a 'core' legislation (the AI Act, Electronic Identification and Trust Services Regulation (eIDAS), and Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MICA) respectively) to which other legislations and instruments are connected. Both AI and DLT have a respective strategy which in turn is connected to the Digital Decade. AI interventions are about values; for identity, it is about values and sovereignty; and, for DLT it is principally about competitiveness. This is to be expected given the negotiations leading up to the MICA [ 17]. In all three we observe a 'white spot' in the sustainability pillar of DG. This is to be expected given that sustainability related interventions occur on the level of data.

Finally, it is possible to visualise the interventions for the digital technologies in a three dimensional visualisation (Fig. 2). Aside from the three technologies, the visualisation also includes interventions related to data, platforms, and cybersecurity as umbrella domain. We added these as any company subject to the AI Act, such as Meta or Google, is likely affected by regulation on data (i.e., the GDPR or the Data Act) and platforms (i.e., the DMA and DSA). This visualisation emphasises the interconnections between interventions; specifically, showcasing the top down approach taken at the EU, starting at the level of the Digital Decade and respective strategies for technologies, all the way down to legislations and instruments.

## 6 Discussion

## 6.1 Findings

The framework we present contributes to practice by opening the 'black box' of digital governance. It opens the black box in terms of dimensions -each of which are supported and discussed in the literature. The framework -characteristically policy-based -we present differs from past works in its simplicity, pragmatism, and orientation towards practical utility. Specifically, the framework is targeted

Fig.  2. DG landscape of the European Union for a selection of technologies.

<!-- image -->

at high-level decision and policy makers, or to researchers and stakeholders who are interested in particular in identifying white spots in DG.

Through its application to the context of the EU, the framework presents a tool to untangle complexity in a pragmatic manner. The two interviewees highlighted this point. Specifically, I4 emphasises that DG is 'for many people a kind of black box.' The framework in turn being 'quite a quick way to present what is existing in the interrelations between [pillars] and the different [categories].' For that, both the 2D and 3D views offer different value: the former (Fig. 1a1b) are more useful to get scoped insights on a particular technology, while the latter ((Fig. 2)) is more valuable to understand and identify the dependencies / connections to other interventions.

Furthermore, the presented framework enhances practical understanding by making explicit the relationships - or lack thereof-between overarching strategies, legislation, and concrete implementation efforts within digital governance. As I4 mentioned, 'it is good to see the relations or lack of relations between general strategies, legislation, and concrete actions that say which are part of [digital governance] or contribute to it. So that's good. It's clear.' Similar arguments were iterated by I5 in relation to the reduction of complexity in digital policy.

## 6.2 Policy  Recommendations

In fact, the current framework allows us to draw policy recommendations specifically in the featured technologies on the z-axis.

Firstly, the AI Strategy and the AI Act emphasize values-driven and responsible governance (see Fig. 1a). However, sustainability considerations and tools to enhance Europe's global competitiveness receive little attention. Furthermore, there is a gap in concrete governance instruments to support these legislative efforts. To address this, we recommend aligning legislative ambitions with robust implementation mechanisms. This includes ensuring adequate financial and human resources for risk assessment and enforcement.

Similar gaps can be identified in relation to digital identity (see Fig. 1c), where sustainability and competitiveness are not directly addressed. This was to be expected as these are less relevant factors [ 56]. The key legislative frameworks introduce the European Digital Identity Wallet. However, as usually done on the Member State level, there is no comprehensive strategy to guide governance, implementation, and resource allocation. This gap is evident in the Architecture Reference Framework, which suggests a disconnect between the technicalities and the human rights-based approach needed for the Wallet's design. To address this, one could establish an implementation strategy, including a technical advisory body to bridge the gap between policymakers and engineers, clear accountability mechanisms to ensure compliance with human rights and data protection principles, and targeted funding to support secure, interoperable infrastructure and usability testing.

Thirdly, regarding distributed ledger technology, the EU has launched a comprehensive Blockchain Strategy, comprising various legislative initiatives, as well as EBSI to strengthen Europe's competitiveness in decentralization technologies (see Fig. 1b). Additionally, ongoing work on the digital euro represents efforts that are argued to enhance European sovereignty. However, values remain largely overlooked, despite the significant environmental impact of certain infrastructures and their implications for user autonomy -or the potential illusion of it. We recommend integrating such considerations into blockchain-related policies by establishing formal environmental impact assessments, and escaping solutionism by dedicating more research into citizens' wants and needs with regard to DLT projects [ 6].

Not only are these recommendations relevant for the respective technologies and policy interventions, but they also highlight the value of our framework in providing transparency regarding the structural and functional connections within digital governance. By clearly mapping these linkages, our framework helps policymakers and practitioners identify gaps, inconsistencies, or misalignments, ultimately supporting more coherent and effective governance strategies.

## 6.3 Limitations

We acknowledge that the generalisability of our contribution is subject to a number of limitations. First, in consideration of the scope of this work, the sample of interviews was small and the validation narrow. The interviews we held, in spite of the individuals' expertise, are subject to biases in the sense that individuals might feel more or less strong about, for example, one or the other pillar of DG (x-axis). The small sample size in turn increases the risk of inducing

that bias. Introducing additional verification strategies -beyond the application (Phase III) and evaluation (Phase IV) steps taken here -would be beneficial to strengthen the validity and reliability of the contributions presented here [ 37].

Second, it remains to be seen to what extent the framework is of actual use in practice and to what extent its generalisability holds [ 55]. In spite of the two interviews conducted with civil servants, it would be of value to test and valorise the framework through additional interviews, including by applying the framework to other geographical areas that deploy very different governance models or by going beyond the public sector alone. The inclusion of practitioners from the private sector - be they from advisory or legal services - may provide additional insights on the value and weaknesses of the produced framework.

Finally, the workshops and interviews also brought forth limitations of the produced framework. First, the suggestion was made to 'draw a line between generic legislation on digital and sector specific' (I5). In workshop W 2glyph[suppress] it was suggested that societal capabilities (e.g., literacy) were missing. Second, I4 also noted that 'soft law is outside the scope of the framework, probably, but it is still important'. Given the scope of this work, the arguments for not including these two are that both add significant complexity. The former would require to include an additional dimension, an axis for sectors, verticals and correspondingly expanding the number of plotted interventions significantly.

## 7 Outlook

Given the conceptual confusion around digital governance in academic literature, we considered how to conceptualise the emerged digital governance landscape and deconstruct its complexity. We focused on State-driven digital governance in the context of the European Union because of the increasing number of digital technologies in which policy interventions take place, the various pillars of digital governance, and the different national implementations thereof.

To address this complex and fragmented landscape, this paper presents a three-dimensional framework of digital governance. The framework consists of four pillars, three levels of policy interventions, and a non-exclusive list of digital technologies to which respective interventions can be mapped. Ex ante, by evaluation to the digital policy landscape of the European Union and interviews with practitioners, the value of the framework is in its capacity to reduce complexity and identify white spots in the landscape. At the current state of the European landscape, we extrapolated some recommendations for each of the analysed technologies and their respective policy interventions.

To conclude, this works unveils a number of future research directions. First, the framework requires a systematic account of interventions to be mapped as data points in the three dimensional plot. This exercise, though beyond the scope of this paper, provides opportunity for near term research. Second, we foresee the framework to be applicable at the national level. This implies the introduction of a fourth dimension (i.e., interventions at EU, Member State, regional, etc. level) which increases the number of data points exponentially. We foresee this

second stream of research to challenge and grow the framework. At last, and as was highlighted in the evaluation, we foresee the value of the framework also lies in its account for connections and relationships between interventions.

Abstract. Central  government  policy  departments  need  to  collaborate  with  executive  agencies  to  provide  IT-based  services  to  society.  These  collaborations  are complicated  by  the  fact that the executive  agencies  are  controlled  by different ministerial  hierarchies,  resulting  in  conflicting  interests.  Yet,  a  detailed  analysis of  these  challenges  is  lacking  in  the  literature.  In  this  paper,  we  analyze  the  challenges  at  several  ministries  through  interviews  focused  on  specific  cases  as  well as  interviews  focused  on  expert  knowledge.  We  identified  the  challenge  themes and  compared  them  with  the  literature,  finding  several  new  challenges  in  practice, including  restricted  procurement,  a  Goldilocks  zone  for  escalation,  the  inability  to hold  an  agent  ultimately  accountable,  and  the  low  priority  the  central  government policy  departments  give  to  the  implementation.  Paradoxically,  central  government policy  departments,  as  principals,  are  less  powerful  and  highly  dependent  on  executive  agencies  instead  of  the  other  way  around,  as  suggested  by  principal-agent theory.  These  findings  imply  that  there  is  a  need  for  new  governance  mechanisms able  to  deal  with  all  the  challenges  encountered.  The  overview  of  the  challenges  can serve  as  a  sound  foundation  for  conducting  further  research  into  cross-ministerial governance.

## 1 Introduction

Public  organizations  in  governments  have  to  collaborate  in  organizational  networks  to deliver  their  digital  services  to  society.  Often,  specialized  executive  agencies  are  used, frequently  using  information  technology  (IT),  to  provide  services  to  multiple  organizations  [1].  The  ministries  responsible  for  delivering  these  IT-based  services  encounter impediments  in  safeguarding  their  interests  in  these  complex  collaborations.  Although agency  theory  warns  of  potential  conflicts  of  interest  and  information  asymmetries  that complicate  the  principal's  control  of  the  agent  (e.g.  [2,  p.  5]),  there  is  additional  complexity in  these  collaborations.  The  complexity  originates  from  the  use  of  IT,  which frequently  changes  [3,  4,  p.  7],  the  unpredictability  of  the  political  domain,  and  the  fact

'  IFIP  International  Federation  for  Information  Processing  2026 Published  by  Springer  Nature  Switzerland  AG  2026

S.  Hofmann  et  al.  (Eds.):  ePart  2025,  LNCS  15978,  pp.  176-191,  2026.

that  service  delivery  organizations  are  often  part  of  different  ministerial  hierarchies  [4, p.  2,  5,  pp.  17,31].  In  such  cases,  the  governance  of  inter-organizational  collaborations [6,  7]  is  not  always  effective  [5].  Since  many  implementations  fail  in  government  [8, p.  69],  the  specific  challenges  and  complexities  need  to  be  understood.

Figure  1  shows  the  specialized,  executive  agencies  that  governments  have  established to  provide  IT  services  for  the  benefits  of  scale,  for  standardization,  and  to  retain  expertise (a.o.)  in  relation  to  the  principals  who  need  these  services.  These  executive  agencies  are part  of  a  ministerial  hierarchy,  but  also  provide  services  to  policy  departments  of  other ministries.  So,  a  request  from  one  ministry  policy  department  (A)  has  to  compete  with requests  coming  from  other  ministries'  policy  departments  (B  and  X)  or  from  the  policy departments  in  its  own  hierarchy  (within  Ministry  B).

These  executive  agencies  weigh  their  own  interests  and  the  interests  of  their  clients, who  act  as  principals,  driven  by  the  objectives  and  concerns  of  the  hierarchy  they  are part  of.  This  can  be  characterized  as  the multiple principals problem in  which  the  agency works  for  many  principals  [9].  Not  surprisingly,  the  interests  of  the  collaborative  partners (agents  and  principal(s))  in  the  public  sector  do  not  always  align  [10, p. 46]. As De Bruijn and Ten  Heuvelhof  [11]  state:  'Getting  what  you  want  -  even  if you  are the boss -isn't  always  easy.  Almost  every  organization,  big  or  small,  works  among  a  network  of competing  interests.'  [11,  p.  1].  Although  this  general  challenge  of  conflicting  interests is  well  recognized,  current  research  remains  at  the  level  of  recognition  of  this  challenge. Still,  deeper  analyses  of  the  typical  challenges  within  the  government  have  not  been conducted  yet.  Understanding  these  challenges  is  needed  as  a  solid  basis  for  improving governance.  Therefore,  our  research  question  is: What challenges inhibit the principal's ability in an intra-governmental collaboration to effectively safeguard its interests when implementing IT-based services?

This  paper  is  structured  as  follows:  We  first  discuss  the  governance  challenges  identified in the literature. Next, we outline the data collection methods,  followed by a detailed  description  of  the  typical  challenges  found  in  our  empirical  research.  After  that, we  discuss  the  findings,  and  draw  conclusions  in  the  last  section.

## 2 Literature Background

In  this  paper,  we  research  a  principal's  challenges  in  governing  collaborations  and  safeguarding his interests. While  we  use the term 'challenges', in the literature various synonyms  are  used,  including  problems,  issues,  impediments,  obstacles,  barriers,  limitations,  hindrances,  hurdles,  complications,  difficulties,  or  pitfalls.  This  section  provides a  brief  overview  of  the  current  scientific  knowledge  on  these  governance  challenges,  to provide  context  for  our  empirical  findings  later  in  this  paper.  This  overview  was  obtained from  key  scientific  fields:  network  governance,  collaborative  governance,  agency  theory,  and  contracting  theory.  The  literature  was  researched  until  thematic  saturation  was reached.  Although  much  has  been  written  in  scientific  literature  about  challenges  in  the governance  of  collaborations  [9,  12-14],  not  all  of  these  challenges  are  relevant  to  this research.  We  are  not  interested  in  private  sector  challenges.  Also,  while  some  challenges pertain  to  collaboration  more  broadly,  such  as  challenges  related  to  resources,  coordination,  and  technical  barriers,  these  are  not  governance-specific  and  can  be  excluded.  This leaves  us  with  the  challenges  in  governing  collaborations,  as  mentioned  in Table 1 .

Mitnick  [12]  proposes  multiple  ways  to  categorize  challenges,  e.g.,  based  on  ownership  of  the  problem  (principal  or  agent)  or  based  on  the  stage  of  the  process  in  which they  occur.  However,  we  follow  Mitnick's  advice  that  'any  categorization  of  agency problems  would  depend,  of  course,  on  the  purpose  and  setting  of  the  analysis'  [12].

Categorizing  the  challenges  based  on  the  scientific  areas  of  network  governance,  collaborative  governance,  agency  theory,  and  contracting  theory  is  problematic  because  these theories  overlap  and  interact  in  complex  ways.  A  categorization  that  fits  in  well  with  this and  gives  a  better  picture  of  the  types  of  challenges  is  the  breakdown  into  individual  and interpersonal  dynamics,  structural  and  systemic  challenges,  and  contractual  and  riskrelated  challenges.  Still,  these  categories  are  not  mutually  exclusive.  Many  challenges have  elements  that  span  multiple  categories.

Interpersonal and Individual Challenges. The  first  category  concerns  challenges  that originate  from  organizations  being  social  constructs  with  people  interacting  on  a  personal  level.  This  results  in  challenges  due  to  autonomy  preference,  cultural  differences, personality  &amp;  interpersonal  issues,  and  trust.

- Autonomy preference :  Agencies  will  strive  for  higher  autonomy  to  resist  coordination from  the  principal  and  gain  the  freedom  to  let  their  own  interests  weigh  more  heavily [2,  p.  6].  Also,  the  agent  may  perceive  coordination  as  limiting  if  held  accountable for  individual  performance  [2, p. 8].
- Cultural  differences : Organizations with different cultures may adopt varying approaches to conflict management,  which can hinder effective governance [14, p.  105].  Arnold  &amp;  De  Lange  [17,  p.  755]  demonstrate  that  organizations  can  develop strong  cultures  rooted  in  opportunism.  Naturally,  the  principal  may  find  it  challenging to  govern  such  organizations  in  a  way  that  aligns  with  their  interests.
- Personality and interpersonal issues: O'Leary  &amp;  Bingham  [14,  p.  105]  remind  us that  organizations  are  made  up  of  people  and  that  governance  is  carried  out  by  and on  people.  These  people  can  clash  with  each  other  on  a  personal  level.  Bendickson et  al.  [19,  p.  15]  add  that  psychological  factors  include  'mood,  affect,  emotion,  and personality.'
- Trust and prehistory of antagonism :  In  a  climate  of  distrust,  goal  congruency  between principal and agent diminishes [6, p. 237], lowers commitment,  and may cause dishonest  communication  [13,  p.  553].

Structural and Systemic Challenges. The  second  category  contains structural and systemic challenges like power imbalances, conflicting interests, multiple principal problems,  and  information  asymmetry.

- Power imbalance :  Power  imbalance  increases  the  risk  for  opportunism  by  the  strong collaboration  partner to gain the  most  value from  the collaboration  [20, p. 1,  13, p.  551].  Imbalances  also  reduce  ex  ante  incentives  to  collaborate,  due  to  fears  of  not receiving  a  fair  return  on  investment  [13,  p.  552].
- Conflicting interests :  One  of  the  basic  premises  of  agency  theory  is  that  the  interests of  the  principal  and  agent  do  not  align  [17,  p.  753,  24,  p.  298].  What  may  be  profitable and  in  the  interest  of  one  could  be  an  expense  for  the  other  [23, p. 58,  19, p. 9,  12, p.  21].
- Multiple principal problems :  An  agent  may  have  multiple  principals,  which  can  cause conflicts  with  other  principals  [19,  p.  13]  and  make  the  principal  compete  with  the

interests  of  the  other  principals,  increasing  the  agent's  autonomy  and  opportunistic behavior  [9,  pp.  671,  676].

- Information asymmetry, communication issues, and monitoring :  Information  asymmetry  occurs  when  the  principal  lacks  the  information  to  govern  the  agent.  This  can be  information  regarding  the  behavior  of  the  agent  or  information  regarding  the  contribution  to  the  principal's  objectives  [12, p. 19,  19,  p.  4].  The  agent  can  capitalize on  this  information  asymmetry  to  pursue  its  own  interests  [17,  p.  753,  24,  p.  298,  19, p.  4].

Contractual and Risk-Related Challenges. The  last  three  challenges  deserve  a  separate  third  category  together:  bounded  rationality,  contractual,  and  risk-related  challenges. These  belong  together  due  to  their  mutual  influence.  For  example,  an  incomplete  contract increases risks, while risk appetite and aversion determine  the desired contract completeness  and  form.

- Boundedrationality, complexity, and uncertainty :  As  previously  discussed,  our  governance  challenges  extend  beyond  organizations  to  include  individuals  and  their  inherent  limitations.  One  such  limitation  is  the  cognitive  constraint  known  as  bounded rationality, which  prevents individuals from making  fully rational decisions with complete  knowledge  of  all  relevant  factors,  potential  consequences,  and  future  contingencies.  [19, p. 7,  25]  This,  of  course,  directly  impacts  the  effectiveness  of  the applied governance  and becomes  more  prevalent in complex  situations (e.g., ITbased  implementations)  or  high  uncertainty  (e.g.,  innovative  markets  and  political environment).
- Incomplete contracts and task programmability :  If  we  take  into  account  factors  like information  asymmetry,  bounded  rationality,  and  difficulty  specifying  appropriate behavior  by  the  agent  in  advance  (task  programmability)  [23,  p.  61],  contracts  are inherently  incomplete,  and  it  would  be  exceptionally  costly  to  include  all  eventualities [27, p. 718, 29, p. 1,  19, p. 7,  23, p. 61].  This  incompleteness  can  lead  to opportunistic  behavior  by  agents,  potentially  undermining  the  effectiveness  of  contractual  agreements  supporting  current  governance  and  alignment  with  the  principal's interests.
- Risk aversion :  Agents  are  known  to  be  more  risk-averse  than  principals  [24,  p.  298, 23,  p.  58,  30,  p.  839].  This  may  motivate  risk-reducing  action  by  the  agent,  hinder the  governance,  and  undermine  the  interests  of  the  principal.  As  Bendickson  et  al. [19]  tell  us  'governance  mechanisms  are  needed  to  help  align  risk  and  monitor  agent behavior  by  the  agent'  [19, p. 4].

This overview  of challenges demonstrates  the diverse,  interconnected,  and  complex  nature  of  collaboration,  as  seen  through  different  theoretical  lenses.  It  is  therefore important  to  gain  insight  into  how  these  challenges  manifest  in  government  setting.

## 3 Research Methodology

This  paper  aims  to  gain  a  deep  understanding  of  the  challenges  inhibiting  the  principal's  ability  in  an  intra-governmental  collaboration  to  effectively  safeguard  its  interests. Our  research  is  'exploratory-descriptive'  [31,  p.  6],  using  multiple  interviews  covering  various  cases  to  ensure  a  deep  understanding  of  the  challenges  encountered  and  to understand  the  enabling  configuration  elements  and  contextual  conditions  [32].

## 3.1 Data Collection and Case Selection

This research focuses on IT-based cases, where relatively many implementations encounter problems  [8, p. 69]. Considering  the rapid IT  developments  [33-35],  we selected  recent  cases  limited  to  the  last  15  years.

## 3.2 Representativeness Cases and Sample Size

To  ensure  the  representativeness  of  our  research  for  the  whole  government  and  different  implementations,  we  interviewed  people  from  five  ministries  (out  of  15  ministries present  in  2024)  with  various  public  tasks,  including  implementations  carried  out  in  collaboration  with  different  types  of  external  and  internal  agencies.  To  ensure  a  complete set  of  challenges,  we  examined  cases  until  no  new  generic  challenges  emerged  -  only case-, ministry-, or agency-specific  ones  that were  no  longer relevant to the  broader analysis.  [36,  p.  611,  37].  Ultimately,  we  gathered  challenges  from  ten  interviews  in total.  Two  interviews  were  used  to  check  for  this  point  of  saturation:  one  interview  with a  principal  advisor  and  one  with  an  agency  advisor.  We  predicted  our  sample  size  based on  the  system  literature  review  research  of  Hennink  &amp;  Kaiser,  who  found  that  saturation occurred  at  12  to  13  interviews  within  a  range  of  9  to  17  [38,  p.  7].  In  our  study,  this saturation  of  challenges  was  obtained  after  only  10  interviews.

## 3.3 Data Source/collection

Data  was  collected  through  semi-structured  interviews  and  from  available  documentation.  The  interviewed  civil  servants,  whether  principals  or  agents,  held  positions  in  the highest  decision-making  governance  bodies  of  projects  or  served  as  direct  advisors  to those  decision-makers.  The  three  main  selection  criteria  for  the  interviewees  were  subject  expertise,  diversity  of  roles,  and  civil  servants  from  different  ministries.  The  advisors were  especially  concerned  about  citations  becoming  public  and  traceable,  and  about  1 in  2  toned  down  their  literal  quotes.

## 3.4 Interview Protocol

An  interview  protocol  for  the  semi-structured  interviews  was  developed  with  variants adapted  for  the  different  target  groups:  single  case  interviews  with  a  principal,  multicase  interviews  with  a  principal,  short  multi-case  interviews  with  a  principal,  and  interviews  with  an  agent.  The  multi-case  interviews,  focusing  on  the  interviewee's  expertise,

tended  to  be  more  expert  than  case  interviews.  The  interview  questions  addressed  the background  of  the  interviewee,  the  context  and  characteristics  of  the  case,  the  role  of  the interviewee,  and  the  challenges  within  the  case.  Possible  prompts  were  developed  for each  question  to  address  governance  instruments  based  on  the  theoretical  fields  described in  Sect.  2:  Theoretical  Background.  Keeping  a  focus  on  challenges,  the  interviewer  considered  those  prompts  that  could  lead  to  fruitful  and  useful  elaborations  in  each  interview. Since  saturation  on  the  challenges  was  reached,  we  can  be  sure  that  no  essential  themes were  missed.  The  interview  process  was  approved  by  the  ethical  committee  of  Delft University  of  Technology.  The  interviews  were  recorded  and,  if  allowed  by  the  interviewee,  transcribed  and  otherwise  at  least  summarized  in  a  concise  report.  All  confidential, personal,  and,  as  much  as  possible,  organizational  information  was  omitted.  The  interviewee  checked,  edited,  and  approved  the  transcription  and  report.  The  cases  and  roles of  the  civil  servants  interviewed  are  included  in  Table  2.

## 3.5 Coding

The  initial  coding  was  performed  inductively  using  open  coding,  identifying  recurring patterns  and  assigning  concise  codes  to  statements.  Axial  coding  was  used  to  identify relations  between  codes  and  the  extraction  of  main  themes.  Themes  with  only  one  code were  merged  into  overarching  themes  based  on  conceptual  similarity.  Saturation  was

reached  during  the  coding  process,  however,  all  interviews  were  still  fully  coded.  All final  themes  were  recognized  by  at  least  three  interviewees  and  occurred  in  at  least  three ministries,  demonstrating  their  relevance  across  multiple  cases.

## 4 Results and Analysis

As expected, the interviews yielded many challenges. Not surprisingly, since we researched  projects  where  IT  was  a  deliverable,  which  are  known  to  have  a  low  success rate. The  challenges  inhibiting the principals'  usage  of  governance  instruments were  coded.  These  challenges  ranged  from  the  human  to  the  organizational  and  political.  Ten  themes  emerged  amongst  the  codes,  which  are  summarized  in  Table  3  and expanded  upon  in  the  following  text.  The  confrontation  with  the  scientific  theories  from the  previous section, 'Literature Background',  is  discussed  in the following  section, 'Discussion'.

## 1. Personal Interests

Personal  interests  were  mentioned  several  times.  Sometimes,  people  were  not  able  to  collaborate  on  a  personal  level.  ' If those were two egos, that wouldn't work '  (AB.03).  Due to  personal  interests,  the  assignment  and  execution  of  implementation  may  encounter higher transaction costs than  necessary.  ' I  called  this  stalling  earlier.  It  seemed  like people benefited from raising these kinds of discussions.' (AA.02).

## 2. Independency of Agents

Ministries  are  faced  with  the  problem  that  the  agencies  are  highly  autonomous  (AA.05, AD.07).  For example,  the agencies draw  up their own  portfolio and strategy  which do not always fit the needs of the principal, and the agency feels increasingly free to refuse assignments  if they do not fit their portfolio  (AA.02)  and  then  complicate assignments  to  delay  the  implementation  (AB.03).  Agencies  also  have  a  different  focus

than  the  ministry  and  that  they  'often  feel  the  need  to  account  for  themselves  to  society, stakeholders,  and  clients.'  (AA.01).  This  was  also  noted  by  Van  Thiel  [5, p. 35]. The sense  of  urgency  and  necessity  of  a  ministry  can,  therefore,  differ  significantly  from  that of  an  agency,  particularly  if  this  is  an  external  agency  (AB.03;  AA.01).  Commonly  in  the Dutch  government,  there  is  a  distinction  in  responsibilities  between  ministry  and  agency, in  which  the  ministry  is  only  allowed  to  describe  what  needs  to  be  delivered,  leaving  the agency  free  to  determines  how  to  implement  this.  ' The client is no longer allowed to say anything about the 'how' during implementation, while the agency's choices have an impact on the result or the 'what'.' (AC.06).

## 3. Information Asymmetry Between Principal and Agent

An  agency  is not always  inclined to provide  the ministry with information  since  an agency  is  reluctant  to  make  its  internal  shortcomings  known  externally  (AB.03,  AA.01, AA.05):  ' Is  it  in  the  interest  of  the  agency  that  it  becomes  transparent?  Some  will think, no, because then we have to expose the bookkeeping and that will only cause us  problems. ' (AA.05).  This  ties in with a cultural aspect mentioned  by  Van  Thiel: 'Political  pressure  and  media  attention  are  often  only  focused  on  incidents:  as  a  result, implementing  organizations  avoid  raising  potential  problems  promptly  and  unrealistic expectations  are  not  challenged.'  [5,  p.  55].

The  other side of the coin is that, due to the high workload  of  the ministry, the ministry  has  to  prioritize  what  the  minister  can  be  held  accountable  for.  Since  the  main task  of  the  principal  is  policy  formulation  and  commissioning  implementation  (AA.02), processing  information  from  the  agent  is  often  given  lower  priority  (AA.05).  Also,  due to  the  high  autonomy  of  the  agency,  asking  for  more  information  can  be  seen  as  distrust by  the  ministry  and  damage  the  relationship  (AA.02).

## 4. Agents Prioritizing Across Clients

An  agency  within  the  government  often  has  multiple  client  ministries  [5],  and  we  found several reasons  why  they  prioritize across clients.  Political  ambitions  mostly  exceed the  capacity  of  the  ministries  and  executive  services  [39,  p.  7],  so  there  is  often  more work  for  an  agency  than  can  be  done  (AA.02).  Despite  meetings  about  the  agency  by the  ministries,  they  do  not  result  in  consensus  on  prioritization  for  the  agency  (AD.07). Regardless of the  workload, an  agency is very protective of their existing statutory tasks  (primary  task)  which  can  cause  them  to  deprioritize  new  services  (AC.06).  Also, agencies  are  reluctant  to  prioritize  a  request  if  it  does  not  fit  in  with  the  agency's  portfolio, architecture,  and/or  expertise  (AA.02).  For  the  ministry,  this  creates  much  uncertainty as  to  whether  an  agency  will  accept  its  new  assignment,  even  if  it  has  a  high  priority, since  the  agency  with  multiple  clients  may  also  experience  different  priorities:  ' you are just part of the game […] the agency weighs that information in another context, in a larger whole that you are not aware of. '  (AA.05).

## 5. Low Prioritization by the Principal (Ministry)

As  already  mentioned,  political  ambitions  exceed  the  capacity  of  the  ministries  [4, p. 2, 39,  p.  16],  who,  just  as  the  agencies,  must  prioritize  their  work.  As  one  of  the  interviewees mentions,  the  ministries'  focus  is  mainly  on  policy  formulation  and  making  sure  their policy  is  implemented  (AA.02),  and  higher-quality  governance  is  ' only done for the larger programs that involve a lot of money and many political interests. '  (AA.02)  Of

course,  this  reduced  attention  of  the  ministry  to  monitoring  the  collaboration  hinders  the timely  detection  of  the  necessary  intervention  and  the  proper  application  of  instruments. This  workload  of  higher  management  also  means  that  governance  is  often  delegated to levels where  mandate  and  organizational  position  are lacking (AA.05).  This lack of mandate  hinders  the application of instruments. It frequently means  the need for escalation  to  a  higher  level.

## 6. 'Goldilocks Zone' for Escalation

As  mentioned  in  the  previous  theme,  'Low  Priority  Principal',  the  workload  at  the  principal's  top  management  means  that  governance  is  often  delegated  to  levels  where  the mandate  is  lacking.  Because  of  this,  escalation  is  often  necessary  to  deviate  from  existing agreements  (AA.02,  AA.05).  This  causes  two  problems:  Because  higher  management at  the  principal  usually  is  not  involved,  their  knowledge  about  the  implementations  is subpar  [40, p. 28],  which  hinders  consideration  of  the  issue  on  substantive  grounds. (AC.06)  Also,  moving  up  the  hierarchy  can  quickly  lead  to  a  level  where  the  problem is  no  longer  significant  enough  to  discuss  in  the  larger  scheme  of  issues  at  that  level (AC.06,  AB.03).

The  interviewees  indicated  a  ' goldilocks zone '  of  management  layers  where  the  lowest  management  level  has  a  sufficient  mandate,  and  the  highest  level  still  has  sufficient knowledge  and  managerial  interest.  They  also  gave  examples  of  parties  with  the  most  to lose,  trying  to  stay  below  the  Goldilocks  zone  (AA.01,  AB.03,  AC.06,  AF.10)  or  quickly escalating  to  rise  above  it.  We  are  aware  that  this  challenge  could  also  be  explained  as  a derivative  of  previous  and  following  challenges,  like  low  priority  for  the  principal,  conflict  aversion  by  the  principal,  and  personal  interest.  However,  because  the  interviewees explicitly  and  separately  mentioned  it,  we  let  this  challenge  stand  independently.

## 7. Restricted Procurement

As  explained  earlier,  the  Dutch  government  and  its  ministries  use  executive  agencies with  specialized  services  to  implement  and  execute  their  policies  [1].  They  often  have  a history  of  providing  these  specialist  services  over  an  extended  period  (AB.03)  and  are the  single  source  of  specific  public  data  (AA.02).  Migrating  services  to  another  agency  is difficult  anyway  because  agencies  are  often  overloaded  and,  therefore,  not  eager  for  new clients.  Thus,  in  selecting  an  agency  for  new  service  provisioning,  there  is  often  only  one choice.  Approaching  non-governmental  companies  is  also  prohibited,  e.g.,  because  the government  cannot  simply  release  sensitive  data  to  third  parties  (AA.02),  (AC.06).  The agency  realizes  this  and  acts  accordingly:  ' This behavior is partly due to a monopolistic position '  (AA.01).  This  monopolistic  position  results  in  a  lack  of  incentive  to  perform at their best or accommodate  requests.  It is seen as an obstacle to using associated governance  instruments  (AA.05).

## 8. Conflict Aversion of the Principal

As  is  well  known,  managers  in  the  public  sector  are  generally  more  risk-averse  than in  the  private  sector.  The  fear  of  personal  risks  leads  to  conflict  aversion  and  hinders discussions  between  principals  about  prioritization  in  meetings  (AD.07).  Conflict  aversion  also  determines  which  control  instruments  are  used  and  followed  through.  Soft controls  are  preferred  because  they  make  it  easier  to  maintain  relationships  and  relations (AA.05).  Furthermore,  the  agencies'  autonomy  makes  it  possible  to  refuse  instruments

such  as  audits,  and  the  principal  does  not  want  to  enter  a  conflict  about  this  (AA.01). This  also  causes  over  expenditures:  ' We are willing to pay extra millions because we want to maintain a good relationship.' (AA.05).

## 9. Bounded Rationality and Incomplete Contracts

Mentioned  by  several  interviewees,  the  future  is  not  always  predictable,  and  contracts have  limited  use  (AC.06):  'Assignments  are  not  to  the  point  and  sharply  formulated  … You  cannot  rule  out  everything  at  the  outset,  and  there  are  always  ways  out.'  (AA.05). Moreover,  the  (financial)  risks,  typically  serving  as  an  incentive,  are  borne  by  the  ministry, leaving the agency  without  this motivating  factor:  '…  the agreement  with  the agency  is  that  you  do  not  get  guarantees  on  the  budgets  agreed  upon  in  quotations.' (AA.02).

## 10. Inability to Hold the Agent Accountable

Another  challenge  arises  because  ministries  and  agencies  are  both  part  of  the  legal  entity 'State'  [5,  p.  14].  This  means  that  contracts  within  the  government  have  no  legal  value, and  it  is  not  possible  to  take  disputes  to  court  (AB.03).  Besides  this  legal  limitation, the  agreements  are  often  not  SMART  (Specific,  Measurable,  Assigned,  Realistic  and Timed  [41])  enough  to  hold  the  agency  accountable.  (AA.05).  Even  if  it  is  possible,  the principal  can  be  faced  by  an  agency  being  part  of  another  hierarchical  line,  in  which case  it  could  prove  difficult  to  hold  them  accountable,  even  if  requested  by  the  CFO  of the  ministry  (AA.05).

One  interviewee  made  the  especially  interesting  note  that  there may  be  a  shared interest  behind  not  making  specific  agreements:  ' The client [principal] and contractor [agent] have an interest in not specifying it fully at the front. This gives the contractor room to say [to the principal] 'Not foreseen, so this [costs] is additional.' and for the client to also say [to finance department] 'Not foreseen, so extra money is needed.' ' (AA.05).

## 5 Discussion: Relating Literature to Practice

A  number  of  the  'challenges  in  practice',  as  shown  in Table 4 , are found  in  the  scientific  literature,  whereas  others  were  only  found  in  the  interviews.  Some  challenges play  a  very  significant  role  in  practice:  conflict  aversion,  information  asymmetry,  and prioritization  across  clients  (ministries).  Four  challenges  are  unique  for  governments:  a 'goldilocks  zone'  for  escalation,  restricted  procurement,  the  inability  to  hold  an  agent ultimately  accountable,  and  the  low  priority  the  principals  give  to  the  implementation. Two  challenges  from  the  literature  did  not  surface  in  our  interviews  as  challenges:  Cultural  differences  were  not  mentioned  explicitly,  possibly  because  they  are  not  commonly considered  in  internal  discussions  or  are  viewed  as  too  vague  or  sensitive,  although  different  underlying  manifestations  were  noted,  such  as  different  risk  appetites  and  priorities. Lack  of trust and a history  of  antagonism  were  identified  only  as  contextual factors,  maybe  because  they  were  not  considered  influenceable  within  the  scope  of  the implementation  case.

We  will  briefly  discuss  the  challenges  from  the  interviewees,  revealing  paradoxically that  the  principals  are  found  to  be  less  powerful  and  highly  dependent  on  agencies,  instead of  the  other  way  around.

- Personal  interests  (known) :  Personal  interests  occur  everywhere  people  work.  We won't  go  into  more  detail.
- Agency  independence  (known) :  Several  challenges  arise  from  how  the  government implements  the  agency  model  and  governs  its  agencies.  A  high  failure  rate  of  implementations  causes  reduced  trust,  with  a  need  for  more  monitoring  conflicting  with  the agency«s  independence.  Stewardship  is  proposed  as  a  solution,  however.  Bjurstr¿m tells  us  this  transition  is  difficult  in  a  low-trust  environment  [42,  p.  1073].
- Information  asymmetry  (large  impact) :  A  prerequisite  for  network  coordination  and one  of  the  foundations  of  agency  theory  is  transparency  in  information.  Ramadass et  al.  [43]  state  that  'Interdependence  between  the  public  sector  agencies  (partners) is  critical  for  interaction  processes  and  information  sharing'  [43,  p.  767].  However, agencies  in  other  hierarchical  lines  with  their  own  political  objectives  and  lack  of enforceable  contracts  make  agencies  highly  independent,  while  the  absence  of  alternative  service  providers  makes  the  principal  highly  dependent.  Further  research  can be  done  on  the  effects  of  introducing  alternative  service  providers.

- Prioritization  across  clients  (large  impact) :  A  high  workload  causes  a  need  for  prioritization.  Despite  a  shared  social  and  national  interest,  coordination  between  principals  is  difficult  due  to  compartmentalization  and  bureaucracy  [5,  p.  33].  The  multiprincipal  problem,  therefore,  causes  prioritization  by  agents.  Further  research  is  warranted  on  whether  this  prioritization  of  (the  implementation  of)  political  commitments by  the  agencies  is  desirable  from  the  perspective  of  the  cabinet.
- Bounded  rationality  &amp;  incomplete  contracts  (known),  inability  to  hold  accountable (unique) : Contracts  have  limited  value  as  governance  instruments  in  government. They  are not legally binding, and the complexity  and unpredictability of IT and politics  make  contracts  incomplete.  In  our  results,  we  also  found  a  mutual  interest  in avoiding  strict  accountability  and,  thus,  the  need  to  maintain  'escape  routes'  for  both parties.  Literature  suggests  that  behavior-oriented  contracts  (as  opposed  to  outcomeoriented  contracts)  and  relational  governance  (as  opposed  to  contractual  governance) could  be  more  suitable.  Further  research  could  be  based  on  Eisenhardt's  propositions regarding  when  a  behavior  or  outcome-oriented  contract  best  suits  the  collaboration and  how  to  reduce  transaction  costs.
- Restricted  procurement  (unique) :  Hardly  discussed  in  much  detail  in  the  literature  is that  ministries  for  their  services  are  limited  to  suppliers  within  the  government: 'Of course, we must remain within the government for management of certain software.' (AB.03)  ' Can the central government simply share information with an independent public-law administrative body? '  (AA.02).  This  is  also  mentioned  by  Thiel  [44, p. 4].
- Conflict  aversion  (large  impact) : Managers  in  the public sector are known  to  be more  risk-averse  than  in  the  private  sector  [30].  Add  to  this  that  for  top  management in  central  government,  the  job  market  is  small,  and  collaboration  roles  can  change or  become  inverted.  Therefore,  we  notice  that  much  attention  is  paid  to  maintaining good  relationships  with  potential  future  collaboration  partners  and/or  higher-ranking colleagues.  Our  findings  show  that  conflicts  are  avoided  as  much  as  possible,  and there  is  a  reluctance  to  challenge  agencies'  fellow  managers,  even  in  cases  of  noncompliance.  Concern  for  self  is  leading  to  the  preferred  conflict  management  style [45,  p.  216]  and  its  effectiveness  [46,  p.  435,  47,  p.  158].
- Low  prioritization  by  the  principal  (unique) :  Provan  &amp;  Kenis  [6]  distinguish  between three  forms  of  collaboration  networks  in  their  paper  'Modes  of  Network  Governance'. Due  to  the  high  workload,  we  found  that  the  principal  only  governs  programs  himself, acting  like  an  NAO,  if  they  have  a  significant  financial  or  political  impact,  and  leaves other  programs  to  a  lead  agency  that  governs  the  collaboration.  According  to  Provan  &amp; Kenis  [6],  in  our  cases  where  there  is  often  reduced  confidence,  these  collaborations could still be effective in accomplishing  their  goals if the  network  governance  is brokered  and  members  collectively  monitor  decisions.
- Goldilocks  zone  for  escalation  (unique) :  Due  to  the  many  management  layers  within the  government  [48]  and  the  tendency  to  delegate  downwards  due  to  the  high  workload at  the  top,  it  is  difficult  to  find  a  management  layer  with  sufficient  mandate  to  decide on  the  conflict  and  sufficient  knowledge  to  make  a  good  decision.  Also,  escalating disputes to a hierarchical level above the ministry politicizes the issue, which it inherently often is not. Discussing  issues in interdepartmental  meetings  and  thus broadcasting  them  in  the  presence  of  unrelated  ministries  is  avoided.  This  should  not be  unique  for  governments  but  is  underexposed  in  scientific  literature.

There  are  some  limitations  and  caveats  to  the  research  in  this  paper.  One  of  the  obvious  limitations  of  interview-based  research  is  that  it  is  based  on  subjective  information from  the  personal  worldviews  of  the  interviewees.  This  introduces  bias  in  the  findings, which,  despite  being  triangulated,  could  be  widespread.  Since  there  are  differences  in accountability  styles  per  country,  there  could  also  be  other  differences  that  affect  the unique  challenges.  Future  research  can  be  directed  at  other  national  contexts.  The  causal relations  between  (combinations)  of  contextual  aspects  of  the  government  and  the  unique challenges  could  be  an  area  for  further  research.

## 6 Conclusion

While  the  general  challenge  of  conflicting  interests  is  well  recognized  when  central  government's  policy  departments  and  executive  agencies  collaborate  on  IT-based  services, deeper  analyses  of  the  typical  challenges  within  the  government  have  not  been  conducted  yet.  Our  research  investigated  what  challenges  inhibit  the  government's  ability in  intra-governmental  collaborations  to  effectively  safeguard  its  interests  when  implementing  IT-based  services.  For  this,  literature  was  reviewed,  and  eleven  challenges  were found:  (1)  preference  for  autonomy,  (2)  cultural  differences,  (3)  personality  and  interpersonal issues, (4) trust and a prehistory of  antagonism,  (5)  power  imbalances,  (6) conflicting  interests,  (7)  multiple-principal  problem,  (8)  information  asymmetry,  communication  issues  and  monitoring,  (9)  risk  aversion and different risk appetites (10) incomplete  contracts,  and  task  programmability,  and  (11)  bounded  rationality  complexity  and  uncertainty.  Our  interviews  revealed  that  ministries  face  several  challenges  not highlighted  in  the  literature,  including:  restricted  procurement,  a  Goldilocks  zone  for escalation, an inability to hold an  agent  ultimately  accountable,  and  the  low  priority the  principals  (ministries)  give  to  the  implementation.  This  confirms  our  starting  point that  deeper  analysis  was  needed.  Also,  several  challenges  seem  especially  prevalent  in governments:  conflict  aversion,  information  asymmetry,  and  prioritization  across  clients (ministries).  This  results  in,  paradoxically,  principals  that  are  less  powerful  and  highly dependent  on  agencies  instead  of  vice  versa.  These  findings  imply  that  there  is  a  need  for new  governance  mechanisms  able  to  deal  with  all  the  challenges  encountered.  Current governance  mechanisms  might  not  hold  in  practice  in  the  specific  context  of  governments.  Further  research  can  focus  on  overcoming  the  challenges  by  developing  effective governance.

Abstract. GovTech  is  propelled  by  collaboration  between  the  public  and  private sectors,  aiming  to  foster  innovation  and  enhance  the  delivery  of  public  services. However,  the  integration  of  GovTech  solutions  remains  complex,  particularly  due to  challenges  in  aligning  startup-driven  innovations  with  public  sector  demands and  overarching  digital  governance  strategies.  This  study  examines  the  strategic alignment  of  GovTech  initiatives  by  proposing  a  conceptual  model  grounded  in public strategic  management  processes  to  analyze  the  determinants  that shape such  initiatives.  The  research  centers  on  the  Madrid  GovTech  program,  which  is part  of  the  broader  Madrid  Digital  Capital  strategy,  and  evaluates  how  the  alignment  between  information  systems  and  government-wide  strategies  influences  the success  of  GovTech  initiatives.  The  findings  contribute  to  the  expanding  body  of GovTech  scholarship  by  offering  theoretical  insights  into  governance  paradigms and  providing  empirical  evidence  on  the  supply-and-demand  dynamics  within  the GovTech  ecosystem.

## 1 Introduction

Digital  transformation  is  prompting  governments  to  reevaluate  their  relationships  with private  sector  actors  to  deliver  personalized  and  citizen-centered  services.  This  movement  has  not  gone  unnoticed  by  startups,  small  entrepreneurs,  and  other  private  sector  players  [1],  encapsulated  within  an  innovation  ecosystem  as  external  providers  of government  technology - GovTech  [2,  3].

GovTech  refers  to  these  solutions  introduced  through  collaboration  between  the  public  and  private  sectors  [1,  3,  4],  based  on  sociotechnical  interaction  for  the  development, application,  review,  and  improvement  of  public  products  and  services.  GovTech  determines  how  government  agencies  manage  projects,  collaborate,  interact  with  suppliers, and  adopt  technologies  and  investments  [5].

Adjusting  to  new  forms  of  public  sector  management  involves  reevaluating  business models  to  create  public  value,  as  well  as  co-creating,  developing,  and  implementing technology-based  solutions  with  an  ecosystem  of  actors  [4].  In  other  words,  external

aspects  of  public  demand,  the  underlying  strategy,  and  environmental  components  are part  of  a  comprehensive  public  business  model  [6].

Public  value  creation  based  on  this  comprehensive  public  model  cannot  be  achieved in isolation and depends on cross-sector collaboration to deliver sustainable and widespread  benefits  [7]. It  is  a  socio-administrative-organizational-technical  exercise [8]. There  is no doubt that GovTech  has  become  a  fundamental  strategic  aspect  for public  agencies,  sustaining  the  promise  of  creating  public  value  [3].

Collaborative  approaches  to  fostering  public  value  in  the  public  sector  are  not  new,  but research  on  inter-organizational  collaborations  remains  inconclusive  [7].  Furthermore, the collaboration between  startups and the public sector has not been theorized [3]. GovTech  goes  beyond  merely  replicating  government  processes  [3].  We  are  not  just building  GovTech  but  creating  administrative  systems  and  processes  that  embed  digital technology;  as  such,  the  transformation  must  begin  with  strategy,  not  technology  [8].

Thus,  leveraging  the  rise  of  GovTech  involves  strategic  decision-making  to  ensure that technological  solutions  align  with  and  extend  society's  strategies  and  objectives [9].  However,  research  on  strategic  alignment  in  the  public  sector  is  scarce  neglected, fragmented,  and  underexplored  [10-12].  The  lack  of  understanding  of  the  processes  and structures  involving  strategies  and  technologies  has  potentially  led  to  failures  that  stem from  poor  adherence  by  individuals,  non-implementation  by  organizations,  or  technology  mismatches  [13].  We  define  the  following  research  questions:  What  factors  influence the  strategic  management  of  the  public  sector  for  GovTech?  Are  GovTech  initiatives aligned  with  broader  digital  governance  strategies  in  the  public  sector?

This  research  adopted  and  updated  a  conceptual  model  centered  on  public  strategic management  processes  [9,  14],  which  allows  us  to  analyze  the  factors  influencing  strategic  management  processes  and  the  outcomes  (effects).  We  adapted  the  strategic  management  elements  of  the  conceptual  framework  [9]  to  recalibrate  the  institutionalized role  of  government  in  the  pre-GovTech  era  [1].  In  doing  so,  we  use  the  concept  of  strategic  alignment  of  information  systems  to  investigate  GovTech's  strategic  alignment  with broader  management  strategies,  such  as  digital  government  or  digital  transformation.

This  conceptual  model  is  useful  for  understanding  the  determinants  influencing  the management  of  information  systems  in  public  sector  entities  integrating  GovTech,  as well  as  their  performance.  We  apply  this  updated  management  process  framework  by Alcaide  Muæoz  [9]  in  the context of digital  governance  to  analyze  the  determinants and  outcomes  of  information  systems  in  public  entities  within  smart  cities.  We  selected Madrid  GovTech,  linked  to  the  Madrid  Capital  Digital  program,  as  the  empirical  scenario. Document  analysis  according  to  the  conceptual  framework  will  complement  the  research design.

## 2 Collaborative  Digital  Governance  in  the  GovTech  Era

The  literature  on  governance  forms  and  government  technologies  [17]  diverges  from  the New  Public  Management  narrative  based  on  more  efficient  and  effective  governments. New  forms  of  governance  are  characterized  by  co-production  and  co-creation  practices that  are  more  in  tune  with  the  needs  of  citizens  [16].  Public-private  networks  and  partnerships  are  being  reshaped  by  opportunities  provided  by  technologies,  renewed  governance

processes,  and  political  objectives  linked  to  public  value  [17].  Digital  governance  invokes financial,  administrative,  and  managerial  considerations  related  to  the  implementation of  technologies  in  specific  organizational  contexts,  as  well  as  ethical  challenges  [16]. Public  value  theory  provides  a  solid  basis  for  understanding  active  agents  of  public  value creation  committed  to  delivering  public  services  that  better  meet  citizens'  expectations. This  includes  value-creation  processes  that  occur  outside  the  organization  [18].

Public  value  can  be  described  as  the  added  value  that  an  organisation  provides  to society  [16],  as  a  multidimensional  construct  it  reflects  the  different  roles  and  interests  of stakeholder  groups  [19].  Generating  public  value  depends  on  factors  that  shape  forms  of collaboration,  supported  by  a  set  of  resources  and  capabilities  or  standards,  such  as  in  the GovTech  ecosystem.  For  example,  new  services  based  on  predictive  models  facilitated by  rapid  and  real-time  access  to  data  will  also  require  process  optimization  and  resource allocation  with  greater  organizational  efficiency  [16].

The  complexity  of  digital  initiatives  is  increasing  exponentially,  and  the  public  sector needs  to  explore  opportunities  for  public  value  creation  that  may  lie  beyond  ministerial  boundaries  [18].  Naturally,  when  capabilities  cannot  be  developed  internally,  public organisations  establish  new  configurations  or  collaborative  arrangements  to  acquire  them externally  [18].  GovTech  refers  to  this  type  of  collaborative  governance  among  public sector  entities,  innovative  companies  -  start-ups  and  SMEs  -  and  public  service  users. This  collaborative  GovTech  configuration  requires  the  acquisition  of  capabilities  that complement  the  'traditional'  public  value  creation  performed  by  the  public  sector  and, as  such,  demands  organisational  alignment.  GovTech  requires  a  user-oriented  approach that centralises early, continuous,  and  effective collaboration  with  stakeholders  [20]. However,  this  public-private  interconnection  requires  coordination  and  mutual  adjustments between  the parties developing and implementing  GovTech.  It seems agreed that the GovTech  approach  is guided by a collaborative, dynamic,  and  ecosystemic effort  towards  innovation  [2]  involving  organisational  adjustments,  such  as  enhanced capabilities  [4].

## 2.1 GovTech  Strategic  Alignment  and  Management  in  the  Public  Sector

The  GovTech  public-private  entanglement  involves  interactions  at  two  levels  [20].  At  the first  level,  GovTech  transcends  the  traditional  public  procurement  relationship  by  involving  new  forms  of  pre-commercial  engagement  and  strategic  public-private  partnership spaces  based  on  the  iterative  development  of  solutions.  At  the  second  level,  GovTech requires  the  restructuring  of  information  systems,  rules,  and  organizational  change  to accommodate  the  testing  piloting,  implementation,  and  scaling  of  new  digital  solutions. This  suggests  GovTech  strategic  alignment  with  broader  strategic  management.

For  GovTech  projects  to  achieve  results,  the  public  sector  needs  to  have  adequate resources  and  implementation  support  for  the  solutions  [20].  This  is  a  strategic  move similar  to  the  new  models  of  data  governance  and  IT  governance  taking  place  in  smart cities  [9].  Therefore,  it  is  necessary  to  align  the  information  technology  strategy  to  ensure that  GovTech  -  government  technologies  -  supports  and  enhances  the  overall  strategy and  objectives  of  the  public  sector's  strategic  management.

Strategic  management  is  a  broad  process  of  managing  an  organization  through  a shared  sense  among  public  managers  to  focus  efforts  and  priorities,  and  guide  decisions

and  actions  [14].  Strategy  creation  involves  realigning  aspirations  and  capabilities  that must  be  achieved  or  need  to  be  changed  [21].  This  means  that  strategy  is  not  limited and  there  are  environmental,  institutional,  and  organizational  factors  that  influence  management  processes  and  results,  producing  actions  or  not  [14].  Strategic  planning  is  the main  element  of  management,  and  both  have  been  a  recurring  research  interest  in  the public  sector  [22],  but  management  focuses  on  continuous  management.  Each  strategic approach  consists  of  concepts,  processes,  procedures,  tools,  techniques,  and  practices to  be  used  or  adapted  selectively.  The  theory  holds  that  if  the  strategy  is  good,  good performance  will  occur  [21].

Evidence  suggests  that  when  strategic  management  planning  is  well  conducted  it can  impact  government  performance.  However,  we  know  very  little  about  why  and  how planning  can  help  [21]  including  for  GovTech.  Strategic  alignment  is  a  central  theme  in the  strategic  management  literature  and  aims  to  establish  the  coherence  of  an  organization's  strategy,  such  as  internal  and  external  functioning  [10].  This  is  particularly  useful because  it  accommodates  different  levels  of  organization,  hierarchies,  and  organizational elements,  such  as  the  public-private  actors  that  interact  in  GovTech.

Strategic alignment of information systems focuses on guiding, integrating, and connecting  business  and  information  systems  in  intra- and  extra-organizational  environments  [15].  Strategic  alignment  has  an  impact  factor  on  improved  organizational performance  and  can  help  organizations  succeed  in  their  broader  digital  transformation efforts  [11].  Furthermore,  strategic  alignment  operates  on  two  levels:  it  promotes  the coherence  of  the  strategy  and  its  internal  and  external  functioning.

Public  sector  organizations  can  engage  in  collaborative  interactions  for  GovTech: funding,  sharing  relevant  data,  testing  solutions,  and  offering  expertise.  However,  the main  role  of  public  administration  is  to  provide  planning  to  adopt  and  promote  the  use of  GovTech  in  the  public  sector  [20].  Strategic  plans  formally  decided  by  governments define  options  and  imply  consensus  around  them  [9].  In  this  article,  we  understand  the positioning  of  the  public  sector  to  make  decisions  and  actions  that  involve  GovTech  as part  of  strategic  management  and  alignment.

## Strategic Alignment: Analytical Structure of GovTech Strategic  Management Processes

According  to  Poister  [14],  strategic  management  involves  determinants  that  can  influence  public  management  processes  and  impact  results  that  affect  or  produce  strategic actions.  Alcaide  Muæoz  [9]  updated  Poister's  [14]  conceptual  model  by  including  digital governance  components  among  the  determinants  of  strategic  management  and,  therefore,  correlating  them  to  the  GovTech  context.  It  is  known  that  digital  technologies  alter the  resources  and  capabilities  of  public  management,  requiring  effective  coordination between  stakeholders  and  information  systems  requirements  to  accommodate  digital solutions  [16].  Therefore,  the  concept  of  strategic  alignment  can  be  used  as  an  analytical  element  of  strategic  management  processes  [11].  This  articulation  is  consistent  with the  fact  that  evidence  indicates  that  in  the  absence  of  agile  project  methodologies  and processes,  public  sector  entities  tend  to  fit  GovTech  projects  into  traditional  structures [20].

We  propose  a  conceptual  research  model,  as  shown  in  Fig.  1,  based  on  the  previous models  and  updated  to  integrate  the  two  strategic  levels  of  GovTech  management.  The

broader  approach  level  of  public-private  entanglement  interactions  aims  to  understand how  determinants  influence  the  strategic  management  of  public  sector  entities'  information  systems  for  GovTech  (RQ.1).  The  output  level  aims  to  understand  the  degree  of GovTech  alignment  with  broader  strategies  (RQ.2).

The  institutional  arrangements  refer  to  the  laws,  regulations,  and  digital  government systems  that  can  influence  decision-making  and  the  actions  of  public  entities  [9].  For instance,  data  sharing  between  the  public  and  private  sectors,  along  with  considerations of  consent,  privacy,  and  accountability,  may  necessitate  trust  anchors  within  GovTech [1].  The  operational  environment  addresses  the  factors  influencing  technology  adoption within  the  context  of  the  initiatives,  including  investments,  standardisation,  and  data  [9]. In  this  context,  public-private  interactions  depend  on  data  and  component  standardisation to  enable  GovTech  interoperability,  while  user  engagement  is  crucial  for  experimentation [1]. Organisational  factors refer to the characteristics, processes, resources, and knowledge  within  public  offices  [9].  In  the  case  of  GovTech,  agile  methodologies  and project  management  appear  essential  to  handle  the  discovery  phases,  iterative  cycles,  and feedback  loops  [20].  Furthermore,  technical  knowledge  is  central  for  the  public  sector to  co-create,  assess,  experiment  with,  and  absorb  GovTech  solutions  [1].

Concerning strategic management, strategic alignment, often referred to as 'business-IT  alignment',  when  applied  to  the  public  sector,  is  defined  as  the  achievement  of  information  technology  objectives  following  the  strategic  objectives  of  the  public  agenda,  relying  on  the  commitment  of  IT  stakeholders  and  management  [11].  While there  is  a  plethora  of  models  and  frameworks  identifying  various  factors  related  to  IT alignment  and  overall  organisational  strategies,  one  approach  is  to  examine  the  areas where  IT  alignment  can  assist  organisations  in  their  attempts  to  achieve  success  [12]. That  is,  analysing  the  efforts  made  and  the  concentration  of  those  efforts  on  shared  objectives  [10].  First,  alignment  between  organisational  goals  and  the  use  of  technologies  can enhance  organisational  performance  [11].  In  the  case  of  GovTech,  the  implementation of  a  digital  service  developed  through  prototyping  and  hackathons  can  be  facilitated  by the  standardisation  of  system  architecture  and  software  [1].  Second,  continuous  organisational  adaptation  generates  the  organisational  agility  required  for  IT  alignment  [11]. Internal  capabilities  to  examine,  co-create,  experiment  with,  and  implement  are  drivers of  the  public  sector's  capacity  to  absorb  GovTech  solutions  [1].  Third,  alignment  should facilitate  the  integration  of  new  technologies  into  existing  infrastructures,  organisational structures,  and  business  processes  [11].  The  design  of  GovTech  solutions  should  feature clear  terms  and  user-centered  regulations,  according  to  the  context  and  needs,  so  as  to offer  a  superior  experience  in  comparison  to  existing  public  services  [1].

Regarding  outcomes,  Poister  et  al.  [14]  identified  desired  outcomes  as  outputs  of strategic  management  processes  in  terms  of  capability  and  performance,  such  as  stakeholder  partnerships,  improved  management  capacity,  analytical  capacity,  regulations, or  service-oriented  strategic  planning.  In  practice,  outcomes  complete  the  cycle  of  processes,  relationships,  and  guidelines  that  influence  the  continuity  of  the  strategy.  From this  analytical  perspective,  a  more  useful  approach  is  to  consider  outcomes  through  the lens  of  GovTech  design  and  governance  [1]  to  assess  whether  GovTech  initiatives  align with  the  broader  digital  governance  strategy.  That  is,  to  analyze  desired  outcomes  as  an enabling  framework  for  the  sociotechnical  artifact  derived  from  strategic  management processes  and  strategic  alignment.  As  GovTech  is  an  emerging  field  with  a  lack  of  empirically  grounded  theoretical  studies,  we  draw  on  Bharosa's  [11]  conceptual  framework for  GovTech  design  and  governance.  The  framework  serves  to  evidence  in  practice  an artifact  that  is  the  result  of  technological,  institutional,  human-centered,  and  governance design  processes.  In  summary,  we  propose  a  framework  (Table  1)  to  analyze  GovTech management  and  strategic  alignment.

## 3 Methodology

We  implemented  a  roadmap  for  design  as  a  research  mechanism  in  information  systems: Design Science Research [23]. In the problem  identification stage, we  conducted a literature  review  based  on  the  GovTech  research  agenda  [1,  3];  prioritizing  the  research based  on  digital  collaborative  governance  and  strategic  management  and  alignment  in the  public  sector.

We  focused  on  defining  the  GovTech  management  framework  as  an  artifact  capable of  supporting  governments  in  GovTech  alignment.  In  the  design  and  development  stage, the  functionality  and  architecture  of  the  artifact  were  determined  based  on  theoretical knowledge  about  strategic  management,  strategic  alignment,  and  GovTech  design,  as shown  in  Table  1.  Strategic  management  encompasses  the  determinants  that  influence

management  processes  and  affect  strategic  actions,  while  alignment  refers  to  the  processes  that  provide  coherence,  and  the  output  level  refers  to  the  elements  that  make  up the  design  of  GovTech  sociotechnical  solutions.

For  the  demonstration  phase,  we  applied  a  case  study.  We  adopted  a  qualitative  case study  strategy,  the  case  of  Madrid  GovTech-Madrid  Digital  Capital,  selected  based  on opportunity  and  feasibility,  as  in  Gasco-Hernandez  [24].  Data  collection  was  carried  out through  documentary  analysis,  conducting  targeted  searches  in  government  reports  and local  government  publications,  as  our  interest  was  to  find  information  on  strategic  plans. We  also  mapped  reports  from  city  partner  actors  involved  in  the  GovTech  initiative.  A similar  approach  was  employed  by  Hammerschmid  [17],  who  also  cautiously  argued that  strategic  plans  inform  goals  and  objectives  and  can  determine  consensus  around ideals,  although  implementation  may  vary.

## 4 Findings  and  Discussion

## 4.1 Determinants  of  Strategic  Management 1

Madrid's  GovTech  strategic  management  is  shaped  by  a  favorable  political  and  economic context,  characterised  by  investments  by  the  Spanish  government  in  digitalisation,  with  a focus  on  agile  contracting,  testing,  and  implementation  methods.  Madrid  Capital  Digital is  a  strategic  initiative  with  a  multi-year  budget  of e 1  billion.

There  is  an  advanced  international  and  European  GovTech  agenda.  In  Europe,  the GovTech4All  consortium,  of  which  Madrid  is  a  part,  promotes  challenges  between  startups  and  incubation  to  support  green  transition  projects  and  the  single  market.  GovTech Connect  is  a  European  platform  for  GovTech.  In  Spain,  several  GovTech  laboratories  and initiatives  serve  as  references  for  Madrid,  including  GovtechLab  Bizkaia,  the  Community  of  Madrid  with  Govtechlab  Madrid,  Alicante  Futura  GovTech  Hub,  Bind  4.0  from the  Basque  Government,  the  Accelerate  Estonia  programme,  Govtech  Lab  Lithuania, Govtech  Campus  Germany,  Govtech  NL  in  the  Netherlands,  and  Vinnova,  the  Swedish innovation  agency,  as  well  as  parts  of  the  UK  government.

Recently,  the  Interoperable  Europe  Act  established  measures  for  high  levels  of  interoperability  within  the  European  Union,  including  support  for  GovTech  cooperation  and the  expansion  of  GovTech  tools,  thus  facilitating  the  development  of  an  open  European GovTech  ecosystem.

Madrid  GovTech  is  part  of  the  Digital  Transformation  Strategy  (2023-2027),  named Madrid  Digital  Capital.  This  strategy  was  established  to  achieve  digital  excellence,  aligning  with  local,  national,  and  European  ambitions.  The  main  objectives  are  to  create  digital services  for  citizens,  promote  intelligent  city  management  based  on  data,  and  position the  city  as  an  attractive  hub  for  digital  sector  talent.

Madrid  GovTech  encompasses  the  creation  of  a  Digital  Hub  -  a  Digital  Innovation Hub  -  and  is  part  of  the  map  of  programmes  and  projects  related  to  the  City  Council

1 The  documents  collected  and  analyzed  related  to  the  Strategy,  Programs,  and  Action  Plans of key sectors and regulations are available in  the  following  repository:  https://www.madrid.es/portales/munimadrid/es/Inicio/El-Ayunta miento/Transformacion-Digital-/?vgnextfmt=default&amp;vgnextchannel=106f7dae756be710Vg nVCM2000001f4a900aRCRDAccessed  in  October  2024.

with  an  innovative  digital  DNA.  A  strategy  and  a  programme  have  been  established. Other  strategic  objectives  supporting  GovTech  include:  strengthening  and  expanding the  publication  of  the  open  data  portal;  promoting  a  culture  of  reuse  specifically  for  the ecosystem  and  the  GovTech  Programme;  and  establishing  an  operational  and  strategic framework  for European  digitalisation measures  for professionals. Additionally, the Digital  Transformation  Strategy  has  a  transparent  and  participatory  governance  structure, consisting  of  an  advisory  board,  an  executive  committee,  and  an  annual  report.

The  Madrid  GovTech  strategy  was  established  with  clear  lines  of  action.  First,  it involves  the  incorporation  of  innovation  into  services  for  citizens  through  the  creation  of testing  and  exploration  spaces  within  public  administration,  addressing  public  needs  and challenges.  Second,  it  aims  to  articulate  and  promote  the  opening  of  a  more  competitive public  supplier  market  by  connecting  startups,  investors,  accelerators,  universities,  and other  stakeholders.  Third,  it  supports  the  development  of  startups  and  small  digital  microenterprises  by  becoming  customers  of  their  solutions.

The  strategy  includes  three  initiatives:  collaboration  with  a  guide  to  support  GovTech strategies;  participation  in  European  Commission  initiatives;  and  the  promotion  of  the Madrid  GovTech  Programme.  In  the  medium  term,  the  strategy  aims  to  position  Madrid as  a  global  reference  in  GovTech,  advancing  its  strategic  positioning.  To  achieve  this,  the goal  is  to  establish  a  baseline  on  the  current  state  of  the  subject  in  municipal  administration,  allowing  for  the  measurement  of  progress.  Moreover,  the  strategy  intends  to  pilot at  least  10  innovative  solutions  with  a  direct  impact  on  citizens,  creating  replicable  use cases.  The  initiative  includes  training  over  70  public  servants  in  GovTech  competencies to lead internal transformation  and  foster  a  vibrant  ecosystem  involving  at  least  200 startups,  scale-ups,  small  and  medium-sized  digital  enterprises,  universities,  investors, and  corporations.

The  Madrid  GovTech  Programme  follows  an  open  innovation  approach,  tackling challenges  identified  by  the  City  Council.  Solutions  emerging  from  the  startup  ecosystem are  sought,  tested,  and  scaled  to  meet  citizens'  needs.  The  city  also  launched  a  short-term GovTech  Action  Plan,  which  includes  spreading  awareness  about  GovTech  within  the city's  business  environments,  coordinating  and  monitoring  pilots  with  startups,  participation  in  the  GovTech4All  consortium  of  the  Digital  Europe  Programme  promoted  by the  European  Commission,  and  launching  the  official  2022-2023  Programme.

Regarding  regulations, the City  Council has established decrees and operational instructions  related  to  government  technologies:  Citizen  Attention  and  E-Government Decree,  Automated  Administrative  Action,  Digitalisation  Policy,  Electronic  Identification  and  Signature  Policy,  Information  Security  Policy,  and  the  Electronic  Inventory  of Procedures  and  Services.

About  the  organizational  elements,  the  Digital  Office 2 Is  a  body  subordinated  to the  General  Coordination  of  the  Madrid  City  Hall.  It  coordinates  the  Digital  Transformation  Strategy  and  its  action  plans,  including  Madrid  GovTech.  The  entity  operates in  conjunction  with  the  City  Hall's  digital  directors  and  the  Information  Technology

Department  (IAM).  Digital  Directors  are  positions  established  by  the  digital  transformation  governance  model,  tasked  with  promoting  the  transformation  process  in  each municipal  activity area. The Directors also facilitate the connection  between  digital administration,  citizens,  businesses,  and  internal  management.  IAM  is  an  autonomous body  specialised  in  information  and  communication  technology  matters.

The  General  Directorate  of  Madrid's  Digital  Office  leads  the  city's  digital  transformation,  developing  technological  strategies,  promoting  infrastructure  and  innovation  in public  services,  and  fostering  collaboration  with  technological  agents.  Its  competencies include  managing  electronic  services,  administrative  simplification,  interoperability,  and overseeing  digital  platforms  and  municipal  applications.  It  is  also  responsible  for  coordinating  digital  governance  at  the  local  level  and  representing  Madrid  in  national  bodies related  to  technology  and  digitalisation.

The  GovTech  Strategy  is  led  by  the  Digital  Office,  which  also  manages  the  GovTech  Programme6.  The  preparation,  execution,  and  implementation  of  the  GovTech Programme  are  carried  out  by  specialised  consultants  through  contracted  services.  Furthermore,  the Digital Office promotes  data  governance,  ensuring  quality,  ethics, and advanced  analysis  to  inform  public  policies  while  encouraging  the  ethical  and  collaborative  use  of  artificial  intelligence.  Its  work  includes  regulating  and  monitoring  algorithms and  supporting  AI  projects  in  partnership  with  public  and  private  agents,  always  aiming for  innovation  and  administrative  efficiency.

## 4.2 Strategic  Alignment 3

The Madrid GovTech Programme aims to promote the development of the entrepreneurial  ecosystem  through  a  new  GovTech  governance  model.  The  alignment  of challenges  occurs  through  two  stages  of  the  programme:  internal  capacity  development for  challenge  identification,  and  diffusion  of  the  challenge  to  the  innovation  community. The  capacity  to  identify  challenges  is  developed  across  the  various  City  Hall  departments through  an  activation  process  conducted  in  face-to-face  sessions.  These  sessions,  which function  as a workshop,  discuss  the  basics  of  a  GovTech  unit,  the  conceptualisation of  the  GovTech  space,  ecosystem  theory,  the  characterisation  of  GovTech  companies, internationally  recognised  programmes,  and  GovTech  procurement  processes.

The diffusion of challenges is promoted  through open innovation methodology, where  the  public  administration  plays  an  active  role  in  seeking  out  suppliers  and  engaging  with  them.  The  programme  directly  engages  the  entrepreneurial  ecosystem  through networks  of  accelerators,  incubators,  technological  centers,  universities,  and  investors. The  programme  also  proposes  conducting  market  studies  of  companies  to  invite  them  to compete.  Challenge  identification  is  a  diagnostic  and  alignment  phase,  aimed  at  obtaining an  innovative  offer  aligned  with  the  product  goal.

The  City  Hall  has  developed  an  open  innovation  methodology  to  convert  challenges into  'products'.  This  methodology  includes  developing  competencies  for  municipal

teams  to  lead  an  open  innovation  system.  The  teams  then  integrate  the  business  model into  their  daily  work  based  on  service  design,  which  is  disseminated  in  training  sessions.

Once  a  challenge  is identified and disseminated,  co-creation  sessions  are  held  to discuss  the  problem  with  a  focus  on  knowledge  exchange.  Agile  methodologies  are introduced,  alongside  the  development  of  minimum  viable  products,  strategic  thinking, and  future  scenario  design.  This  collaborative  work  phase  also  receives  training  support to  address  the  differences  in  culture,  resources,  and  working  methods  between  the  public  sector  and  the  entrepreneurial  ecosystem.  Resources  used  to  create  dynamic  spaces between  institutions  interested  in  solving  the  challenges  include  semi-structured  meetings,  pitches,  rounds,  and  interviews.  The  knowledge  generated  in  this  phase  is  converted into  pilot  proposals,  innovation  briefs,  or  work  plans.

After the  diffusion  of  challenges  and  knowledge  exchange,  the  selection  of  pilot companies  takes  place,  followed  by  the  definition  of  the  piloting  process.  Ideas,  proposals,  and  plans  are  integrated  and  implemented  into  various  solutions,  following  the organisational  changes  suggested  in  the  earlier  stages,  and  evaluating  their  performance. The  pilot  process  begins  with  the  solution  of  interest  to  the  public  institution,  whose performance  is  measured  on  a  technological  scale,  impact  on  public  servants'  work, trust  generated  with  users,  and  process  sustainability.

## 4.3 GovTech  Outcomes

In  this  study,  we  emphasise  and  theoretically  articulate  that  governance  in  the  GovTech context  aims  at  the  public  value  [3]  generated  from  new  collaborative  configurations dealing with citizen-centered technologies [16, 17] supported by a set of resources and  capabilities  created  or  enhanced  [4,  19]  between  public  sector  organisations  and stakeholders.

As  such,  we  suggest  that  the  proactive  positioning  of  the  public  sector  to  make  decisions  and  take  actions  related  to  GovTech  involves  management  and  strategic  alignment to  achieve  outcomes  [14].  In  terms  of  GovTech,  the  outcomes  suggest  a  dual  effect:  on the  one  hand,  a  solution  for  governments  aiming  at  public  service  innovation,  and  on the  other  hand,  a  concern  for  governments  due  to  the  lack  of  technical  knowledge  and its  implications  for  decision-making  [1].

To  answer  the  first  research  question,  we  proposed  an  analytical  framework,  Table  1, where  the  environmental,  institutional,  and  organisational  determinants  can  influence GovTech's  strategic  management.  Madrid  GovTech  is  a  governmental  strategy  and  a government  programme  influenced  by  the  advancements  in  the  digitalisation  of  public  services  in  Europe.  The  context  of  modernisation  in  procurement  and  technology implementation  by  the  Spanish  government  is  an  environmental  factor  that  impacts  the management  of  digital  transformation  in  the  city  of  Madrid.  The  city  also  benefits  from national  policies,  as  it  is  the  national  capital.  However,  no  concrete  practice  or  inducing approach,  such  as  an  action  plan  or  technical  cooperation  for  GovTech,  was  identified within  the  national  vector  for  the  local  level.  Other  emerging  GovTech  ecosystems  in Europe  have  also  influenced  the  design  of  the  strategy  and  the  programme.  The  Madrid City  Council  is  also  part  of  the  European  consortium  GovTech4all,  which  functions  as a  European  GovTech  incubator.

Regarding  institutional  factors,  Madrid  GovTech  operates  in  a  governmental  system favorable  to  the  implementation  of  public  policies,  as  there  are  district  councils  to  support the  management  of  the  City  Council.  There  is  a  governance  structure  based  on  the  Digital Transformation  Strategy  that  benefits  the  initiative.  Short-term  action  plans  and  interdependent  objectives  with  other  projects  have  been  established.  According  to  Niehaves and  Klassen  [26],  policies  for  entrepreneurship,  active  government  programmes,  and the  regulatory  environment  are  crucial  to  promoting  GovTech  ecosystems.  However, the  lack  of  reference  to  GovTech  and  the  regulation  of  data  protection  and  cybersecurity,  setting  out  recommendations,  milestones,  or  practices,  could  be  a  considerable  gap. From  this  perspective,  it  is  essential  to  consider  the  environmental  determinants,  the regulations  established  within  the  European  Union  framework,  and  those  that  apply  to the  case  study.

With  the  institutional  framework  establishing  actions,  goals,  and  aligning  plans,  the alignment  of  management  objectives  naturally  facilitates  the  strategic  alignment  of  IT. However,  no  progress  measurement  structures  were  identified,  although  this  is  part  of the  announced  objectives  of  the  GovTech  Strategy.  There  are  essential  institutional  factors  for  which  no  documented  evidence  was  found:  policies,  acquisitions,  intergovernmental  agreements,  data  protection  regulation,  and  information  security  structures.  GovTech  policies  could  extend  programmes  beyond  government  programmes,  consolidating GovTech  as  a  facilitator  of  public  policy.

Moreover,  policies  are  essential  to  distinguish  public  from  private  components  [1], to  categorise  which  types  of  public  assets  and  services  should  be  involved  in  GovTech, and  to  organise  the  formation  of  the  GovTech  environment  and  the  dynamics  of  its  actors [26].  The  establishment  of  policies  is  also  a  precondition  for  facilitating  cross-border GovTech  practices  [26],  which  are  essential  for  achieving  the  European  ambitions  of interoperability.

Regulations to simplify public procurement processes that favor business and entrepreneurial  activities  should  be  part  of  the  broader  government  strategy  but  associated  with  GovTech.  While  procurement  has  been  announced  as  an  important  aspect  and incorporated  into  strategic  alignment  processes,  it  is  not  clearly  defined  as  part  of  the programme  or  as  a  core  action  of  the  strategy.

With  regard  to  organisational  determinants,  the  regulatory  gap  reveals  a  certain  deficiency  in  the  implementation  of  the  Digital  Office's  competencies.  For  example,  the Office  is  responsible  for  data  governance  and  aspects  of  artificial  intelligence.  However, the  competencies  to  draft  norms  and  recommendations  could  be  better  utilised  to  support the  management  processes  of  the  Programme,  at  least  up  to  this  point.  The  Digital  Office is  empowered  to  lead  the  broader  strategic  management  related  to  digital  transformation  and  the  GovTech  Strategy.  However,  the  leadership  style,  capacities,  and  resources related  to  the  GovTech  Programme  are  unclear,  including  concerning  the  shared  management  with  the  city's  IT  company  and  the  digital  directors.  It  is  not  possible  to  identify the  degree  of  involvement  of  the  Office  in  the  planning  and  strategic  management  of GovTech,  as  there  are  no  indicators  or  evaluation  metrics.

To answer  the second  research  question, which  seeks  to  understand  whether  the GovTech  initiative  is  aligned  with  the  broader  governance  strategy,  we  examined  the alignment  of  objectives,  adaptation,  organisational  agility,  and  integration.  We  proposed

an  analytical  framework,  Table  1,  in  which  the  processes  of  management  and  strategic alignment  impact  GovTech  outcomes.

We  classified  the  strategic  actions  related  to  the  Madrid  GovTech  Programme  into three areas where strategic alignment can assist public sector organisations in their attempts  at  digital  transformation.  In  general,  the  three  areas  of  strategic  alignmentalignment  of  objectives, adaptation, agility,  and  integration-fulfilled  the  premise  of synchronization  with  the  organisation's  strategies.  Therefore,  in  light  of  the  changing context  and  environmental  factors,  the  city  defined  and  chose  its  strategic  position.  GovTech  management  was  included  in  the  city's  strategic  planning,  establishing  synergy  with other  initiatives.  Cases  of  open  government  initiatives  at  the  local  level  in  the  Andalusia  region  also  established  this  comprehensive  view  of  operations  [10].  Thus,  different organisational  hierarchy  levels,  and  even  between  different  organisational  levels,  were overcome  through  strategic  alignment.

Regarding the relationship between leaders and members  of organisations, and between  organisations,  there  is  an  asymmetry  of  information  concerning  strategic  alignment.  The  design,  development,  support,  and  dissemination  of  the  Madrid  GovTech Programme  was  contracted  to  an  incubator  external  to  the  government.  The  objects  of the  contract  include  the  mapping  of  actors  and  capacities,  training,  programme  design based  on  an  open  methodology,  and  a  communication  plan  for  the  Programme.

First, continuous  adaptation  and  organisational  agility  studies indicate that  when organisations  undergo  phases  of  digital  transformation-internal  integration,  business process  redesign,  redefining  business  scope,  and  business  network-continuous  changes are  inevitable  [27].  However,  these  changes  are  a  management  task,  requiring  agility beyond  the  results  cycle,  that  is,  those  relationships  that,  in  practice,  affect  the  continuity of  strategy  [14],  and  are  not  confined  to  the  duration  of  a  contract.

Secondly,  the  integration  of  technologies  must  go  hand  in  hand  with  the  necessary changes  and  adaptations,  as  well  as  anticipate  the  current  and  future  IT  needs  and  the required  organisational  adjustments.  The  merging  of  strategies  depends  on  creating  a common  language  that  can  be  understood  by  both  IT and the remaining  units [27]; therefore,  information  symmetry  is  essential.  Although  an  evaluation  framework  has been declared as part of the programme  evaluation,  both  for  pilot cases and for the dissemination  and  scaling  of  solutions,  we  could  not  find  such  information  available.

## 5 Conclusion

In  this  study,  we  analyse  the  Madrid  GovTech  initiative  by  artefact-framework,  which is  promoted  by  the  Digital  Office,  and  linked  to  the  General  Coordination  of  the  City Council  of  Madrid.  The  GovTech  initiative  in  Madrid  is  aligned  with  the  broader  strategic governance  management,  but  there  are  several  areas  of  concern  related  to  the  outcomes of  management  and  strategic  alignment.  We  have  identified  that  institutional  regulatory factors  are  gaps  in  the  strategy.  There  is  a  lack  of  alignment  between  data  management and  protection,  as  well  as  information  and  telecommunications  security.  This  nascent stage  is  further  compounded  by  the  lack  of  applicability  of  the  common  competencies of  the  managing  body  in  these  areas-data,  cybersecurity,  and  GovTech.  Organisational competence  is  being  underutilised,  as  the  intersection  of  these  areas  could  facilitate  the

organisational  agility  necessary  for  projects  that  increasingly  require  the  use  of  artificial intelligence in the public sector. Consequently,  there  are gaps in legal security, data quality,  system  quality,  and  cybersecurity  that  are  needed  to  enhance  the  reliability  and credibility  of  GovTech  [1].

We  also  found  that  information  asymmetry  between  members  of  the  organisations and  between  the  organisations  themselves  may  be  related  to  the  effectiveness of the GovTech  design  and  governance.  It  is  unclear  what  role  the  public  agency  plays  in  determining  the  management  resources  for  the  GovTech  Programme,  as  ideation,  execution, and  implementation  are  driven  by  external  consultancy.  Bharosa  [1]  suggested  a  solution whereby  public  agencies  can  exert  input,  output,  behavioral,  and  normative  measures over  GovTech  providers.  Again,  the  public  manager  of  the  GovTech  Programme  assumes the  role  of  an  agent,  which  could  be  an  obstacle  to  achieving  common  behavior  with  the principal,  paraphrasing  the  principal-agent  theory  [10].  On  the  other  hand,  the  training activities  within  the  GovTech  Programme  focusing  on  internal  capabilities  in  the  public sector  contribute  to  the  absorption  capacity  needed  to  proactively  shape  GovTech  solutions  [1].  Finally,  we  identified  that  the  Programme  includes  evaluation  and  performance activities  for  GovTech  cases.  However,  it  is  unclear  whether  this  agenda  includes  ethical  parameters  where  human  values  are  infused  into  both  functional  and  non-functional requirements  [1].

GovTech  initiatives  may  be  strategically  aligned  with  management  strategies,  but institutional  and  organisational  factors  must  also  be  considered  for  continuous  alignment.  GovTech  regulation  remains  a  challenge,  reflecting  the  need  for  competencies  that consider  central  assets  for  GovTech,  such  as  institutional  levers  and  regulatory  frameworks  for  data,  public  procurement,  and  information  security.  Although  our  focus  was on  strategic  management,  strategies  are  not  formed  without  the  awareness  and  influence of  environmental,  institutional,  and  organisational  factors.

We  acknowledge  the  limitations  of  our  research,  including  the  selection  bias  inherent  in  focusing  on  a  single  case  study.  On  the  other  hand,  we  selected  a  European  case, Madrid  GovTech-Madrid Digital Capital-considering that  public  administration  operates  within  similar  regulatory  structures,  strategies,  and  values  [25],  which  allows  for potentially  generalizable  conjectures.  Therefore,  the  conceptual  model  can  be  applied  to analyse  and  compare  other  cities  in  the  future.  We  also  recognise  the  potential  of  interviews  to  corroborate  the  evidence  gathered  through  document  analysis  and  categorical review  of  strategic  documents.  On  the  other  hand,  we  see  value  in  engaging  with  other public  management  and  digital  governance  theories  to  better  understand  GovTech.

Abstract. Strategic  alignment  is  essential  for  digital  transformation  in  the  public sector,  enabling  more  citizen-centric  services  and  cross-organizational  collaboration.  However,  research  on  alignment  has  primarily  focused  on  intra-organizational dynamics  as part of business-IT alignment, overlooking the broader,  continuous  nature  of  alignment  in  digital  transformation.  Moreover,  while  some  studies propose  practical  approaches,  there  is  little  concrete  design  knowledge  on  what works  in  practice.  This  study  addresses  these  gaps  through  a  design-based  approach,  examining  how  public  sector  organizations  can  develop  training  programs that  foster  strategic  alignment  for  digital  transformation.  Using  a  four-year  action design  research  (ADR)  collaboration,  the  Digital  Leaders  Academy  was  designed, a  vocational  training  initiative  that  has  engaged  over  330  senior  public  sector  professionals.  The  research  combines  participant-observation,  internal  documents, field  notes,  interviews,  and  surveys  to  develop  a  tailored  a  solution  while  also  generating  broader  insights.  Findings  highlight  key  design  principles  that  facilitate alignment.  The  research  contributions  include  actionable  strategies  for  improving digital  transformation  alignment,  and  offering  a  deeper  insight  in  alignment  for digital  transformation.

## 1 Introduction

Digital transformation - a process  of  organizational  change  that  leverages  digital  technology  -  promises  to  create  more  agile  governments,  improve  service  delivery  and  introduce new  ways  of  collaborating  with  stakeholders  [11,  25,  26].  Achieving  these  outcomes, however,  requires  alignment  across  multiple  levels  and  actors  [14].  For  instance,  transforming  welfare  delivery  to be citizen-centric necessitates aligning shared  goals and digital  strategies  across  various  stakeholders  to  provide  a  seamless  experience.  One  life event, such as the birth of a child, often requires contact  with  different  government organizations  at  different  levels.  Also  within  these  organizations,  alignment  between different  units  is  required.

Despite  its  importance,  our  current  understanding  of  alignment  in  digital  transformation  remains  limited  in  two  key  areas.  First,  most  research  has  concentrated  on  businessIT  alignment  [29,  36],  while  alignment  for  digital  transformation  also  involves  collaboration  with  external  actors  beyond  the  organization  and  is  more  continuous  in  nature [25,  37].  Second,  while  there  have  been  attempts  to  make  alignment  more  practical  by focusing  on  what  organizations  can  actually  do  [20],  existing  research  provides  little practical  design  knowledge  on  'what  works'  [3,  31].

Therefore,  this  study  adopts  a  design-based  approach  to  explore  strategic  alignment within  digital  transformation.  It  seeks  to  answer  the  question:  'How  can  public  sector organizations  develop  successful  training  programs  that  contribute  to  strategic  alignment for  digital  transformation?'.  The  study  is  based  on  a  four-year  action  design  research (ADR)  project  [7,  33]  for  co-creating  the  Digital  Leaders  Academy,  a  comprehensive vocational  training  initiative  which  has  trained  over  330  high-level  participants,  including  general  directors,  business  and  IT  directors,  and  department  heads  of  regional  and local  governments.  The  research  involved  close  collaboration  with  practitioners  through participant-observation  and  field  notes,  internal  document  inspection,  interviews  and surveys,  allowing  to  not  only  develop  solutions  tailored  to  the  Academy's  specific  goals but  also  generate  broader  insights  through  meta-requirements  and  design  principles.

This  study  makes  two  main  contributions:  (1)  it  provides  design  knowledge  through a  set  of  design  principles,  equipping  other  organizations  with  practical  tools  for  fostering strategic  alignment,  and  (2)  it  deepens  our  understanding  of  strategic  alignment  in  digital transformation.

## 2 Background

## 2.1 Digital  Transformation  in  Government:  A  Need  for  Alignment

Governments  worldwide  are  undergoing  digital  transformation,  driven  by  increasing data  availability,  emerging  technologies,  shifting  citizen  expectations,  and  external  disruptions  such  as  the  COVID-19  crisis  [34,  37].  Digital  transformation  is  defined  as  'a fundamental  change  of  processes,  enabled  by  the  innovative  use  of  digital  technologies  accompanied  by  the  strategic  leverage  of  key  resources  and  capabilities,  aiming to  radically  improve  an  entity  [i.e.,  an  organisation,  a  business  network,  an  industry,  or society]  and  redefine  its  value  proposition  for  its  stakeholders'  [11].  It  is  not  merely  the adoption  of  new  technologies,  but  a  fundamental  reconfiguration  of  processes,  capabilities,  and  organizational  culture,  and  aims  to  improve  service  delivery,  enhance  crossorganizational  collaboration,  and  make  governments  more  agile  and  responsive  to  change [25].

A  key  challenge  in  this  transformation  is  ensuring  alignment  across  multiple  actors and  organizational  levels  [14].  Unlike  traditional  IT  modernization  efforts,  digital  transformation requires governments  to synchronize  strategies, policies and technologies in a dynamic and often uncertain environment [19, 25]. Misalignment can lead to inefficiencies,  fragmented  digital  services,  and  failed  transformation  initiatives  [22].

## 2.2 Strategic  Business-IT  Alignment

One  of  the  dominant  perspectives  on  alignment  in  IT-enabled  change  is  business-IT alignment,  defined  as  'the  application  of  IT  in  an  appropriate  and  timely  way,  in  harmony with business strategies, goals and  needs' [24, p. 3]. This  concept has been  widely studied, highlighting alignment as a key enabler of organizational  performance  and digital  innovation  [1,  21].

Early  research  framed  business-IT  alignment  as  a  static  state,  where  IT  and  business strategies  should  be  matched  [15].  More  recent  work,  however,  recognizes  alignment as  a  continuous,  dynamic  process  that  requires  ongoing  adjustments,  also  in  response to  environmental  changes  [1,  20,  29].  Scholars  have  identified  several  mechanisms  that facilitate  alignment,  ranging  from  more  structured  and  deliberate  interactions  to  continuous  actions.  Strategic  planning  and  prioritization  ensure  that  IT  initiatives  support organizational  goals  [4].  Structured  interactions  and  communication  between  IT  and business  units  contributes  to  bridge  differences  in  language,  priorities  and  objectives [32].  Continuous  monitoring  of  external  changes  allows  organizations  to  adjust  their  IT and  business  strategies  in  response  to  evolving  conditions  [20,  35].

While  business-IT  alignment  remains  relevant,  it  has  limitations  when  applied  to  digital  transformation  in  government.  First,  most  studies  assume  alignment  occurs  within a  single  organization,  whereas  digital  transformation  often  requires  coordination  across multiple organizations  and  stakeholders  [11, 14, 37].  Second,  the  business-IT  alignment  literature  largely  overlooks  regulatory  constraints,  policy  agendas,  and  public  sector  accountability  structures  that  influence  digital  transformation.  In  the  public  sector, however,  business-IT  alignment  must  consider  various  government  levels,  the  involvement  of  multiple  political  and  administrative  actors  across  these  levels,  and  the  broader institutional  context  [19,  36].  Third,  while  scholars  have  emphasized  the  importance of  alignment,  there  is  little  concrete  guidance  on  how  organizations  can  operationalize alignment  in  practice  [3,  31].

## 2.3 Toward  a  Design-Oriented  Perspective  on  Alignment

Given  these  broader  challenges,  there  is  a  need  to  rethink  alignment  beyond  traditional business-IT  perspectives.  More  recent  research  emphasized  the  need  for  more  practical, action-oriented  approaches  that  focus  on  what  organizations  can  actually  do  to  foster alignment  [1,  20,  29].  This  aligns  with  a  broader  call  in  public  management  to  move beyond  understanding  towards  providing  empirical  evidence  on  'what  works'  [2,  3,  30, 31].  Design  science  offers  a  promising  way  forward,  emphasizing  the  development  of concrete  strategies,  tools  and  interventions  that  help  organizations  navigate  alignment challenges  in  complex  environments  while  also  aiming  for  generalizable  insights.

## 3 Methodology

Design  science  research  (DSR)  aims  to  develop  innovative  artefacts  while  generating knowledge  about  their design [17, 28]. This study adopts an action design research (ADR)  approach,  a  specific  form  of  DSR  [33].  A  key  aspect  of  ADR  -  distinguishing

it  from  other  DSR  genres  -  is  its  emphasis  on  building  and  evaluating  ensemble  artefacts  within  their  organizational  context.  It  prioritizes  organizational  impact,  continuous learning  and  iterative  feedback  [8,  16].  These  characteristics  make  ADR  particularly suited  for  studying  the  development  of  vocational  training  programs  that  foster  strategic alignment  for  digital  transformation  [23].  Unlike  action  research,  ADR  not  only  focuses on  organizational  impact  but  also  aims  to  create  artefacts  with  broader  applicability  and explicitly  aims  for  generalizability  in  the  form  of  design  principles  [16].

## 3.1 ADR  Research  Context

Digital  Flanders  is  the  agency  in  the  Flemish  region  of  Belgium  responsible  for  digital government.  It  was  created  in  2021  through  an  amalgamation  of  several  agencies  responsible  for  digitalization,  data  and  ICT  facilities,  and  has  a  total  of  around  740  employees. Digital  Flanders  is  a  digital  partner  for  both  Flemish  and  local  governments,  offering  IT services,  data  services,  projects  and  guiding  governments  in  their  digital  transformation projects.

The  Flemish  government  has  high  ambitions  for  the  digitalization  policy  domain, which  has  been  located  directly  under  the  responsibility  of  the  Minister-President  for  two consecutive  government  terms.  It  wants  to  become  part  of  the  European  top  and  jumped to  the  6th  spot  in  the  2023  Digital  Economy  &amp;  Society  Index  (DESI),  coming  from  the 13th  spot just one  year earlier in 2022.  In 2023,  it established  a Flemish  data  utility company  (Athumi)  to  'allow  data  to  flow  more  freely  in  the  Flemish  and  European data  economy,  with  citizens  in  control  of  their  personal  data'  and  invested  7  million euros  in the first  2  years  of  a  4  year  research  project  by  multiple  university  research groups.  Several  projects  and  products  of  Digital  Flanders  have  won  awards,  such  as  the Enabling  Technologies  Award  at  the  Smart  City  World  Expo  in  2021  for  the  Digital Urban  European  Twin  and  the  European  Sharing  &amp;  Reuse  award  (2nd  prize)  in  2017  for two  shared  services.

Digital  Flanders  has  always  combined  a  focus  on  data  and  operational  efficiency  with a  customer-oriented  culture.  Over  time,  the  focus  on  geographical  data  -  dating  back  to its  roots  in  the  Geographical  Information  Agency  -  was  supplemented  with  a  focus  on authentic  sources,  open  data  and  standards.  The  customer-oriented  culture,  dating  back to  the  'Info  Line'  (a  Flemish  form  of  311  services)  which  was  also  absorbed  into  the agency,  led  Digital  Flanders  to,  over  time,  focus  more  and  more  on  services.  It  wanted  to relieve  the  burden  on  other  government  entities  [9]  by  providing  platforms  and  solutions 'as  a  service'  that  could  be  plugged  into  business  processes  of  other  agencies,  including  framework  contracts,  identity  and  access  management  (ACM/IDM),  data  exchange infrastructure  (MAGDA),  IT  security  services,  and  My  Citizen  Profile,  'an  ecosystem of  building  blocks  that  aims  to  provide  natural  persons  a  no-wrong  door  access  to  public services  of  all  local  and  regional  public  legal  entities'  [39].

Since  the  start  of  the  previous  government  term,  in  2019,  Digital  Flanders  also  started to  focus  on  digital  transformation  and  on  facilitating  change  in  other  Flemish  and  local entities.  It  is  within  this  focus  area  that  the  Digital  Leaders  Academy  fits.  The  Digital Leaders  Academy  'provides  training  on  digital  strategy and transformation,  collects best  practices  on  these  themes  and  connects  interested  parties  with  each  other  during networking  sessions'.  Since  its  set-up  in  2021,  over  330  participants  (business  and  IT

directors,  leading  officials  of  departments  and  agencies  of  the  Flemish  government  and general  directors  of  Flemish  provinces,  cities  and  municipalities)  took  part  in  the  different programs  of  the  Digital  Leaders  Academy,  see  Table  1.

The  core  DLA  program  consists  of  10  half  day  sessions  and  a  final  networking  session.  Two  editions  are  organized  every  year,  leading  up  to  a  total  of  9  editions  up  to  now. It  has  been  completed  by  188  managers  and  directors  within  the  Flemish  government and  local  authorities.  The  core  DLA  program  trains  new  participants  in  every  edition, but  the  program  stays  more  or  less  the  same  across  the  different  cohorts.

A separate program, referred to as 'top events', is specifically aimed at the administrator-generals  of  Flemish  departments  and  agencies.  Unlike  the  core  DLA  program,  it  is  targeted  at  the  same  participants  every  time  (about  90  administrators-general

and  their  direction  members,  with  around  35  (different)  people  joining  each  event),  but the  content  also  changes  every  time.  Two  events,  each  lasting  for  either  half  a  day  or  a full  day,  are  organized  every  year.  The  first  event  focused  on  a  general  overview  of  the core  DLA  program  in  one  day.  Later  events  focused  on  digital  maturity,  digital  strategy,  cybersecurity,  data  governance,  and  AI.  Each  time,  reputed  speakers  from  outside government  or  renowned  international  governments  are  invited.

A  variant  of  the  top  event  program,  Filbert  goes  digital,  is  organized  specifically  for the  general  directors  of  local  governments.  This  consists  of  a  3-day  condensed  version of  the  core  DLA  program,  adapted  to  the  local  government  context.  A  total  of  65  general managers  took  part  int  first  two  editions.

## 3.2 Insights  into  the  Design  Research  Process

Our  DSR  approach  began  with  addressing  Digital  Flanders'  specific  challenge  by  designing  a  concrete  artefact - the  Digital  Leaders  Academy  and  its  different  training  programs. Through  interventions,  this  research  aimed  to  derive  insights  that  could  inform  a  more generalizable  solution  for  similar  challenges  [18].  Our  approach  covered  all  four  stages of  an  ADR  process  [33]  as  illustrated  in  Fig.  1,  and  was  carried  out  in  close  collaboration with  Digital  Flanders.

The  ADR  team  consisted  of  the author, Digital Flanders' director of the Digital Strategy  and  Transformation  Department,  and  the  Digital  Leaders  Academy  Program Manager.  The  ADR  process  was  carried  out  as  an  iterative  process.  In  Table  2,  we  provide an  overview  of  the  main  ADR  interventions.

## 4 Results

## 4.1 Problem  Formulation

At  the  start  of  our  study,  in  2021,  Digitaal  Vlaanderen  noticed  that,  across  Flemish  and local  governments,  digital  transformation  was  regarded  too  often  as  the  sole  responsibility  of  IT  directors  and  IT  departments.  As  a  result,  new  digital  projects  often  focused on  incremental  and  technical  improvements,  and  did  not  focus  on  strategic  issues  for the  organization  or  government  as  a  whole.  The  administrator-general  and  the  future program  responsible  for  the  DLA  argued  that:

'Maturity must be increased among managers so that they feel comfortable entering into discussions and defining projects themselves, or assessing such programs and chairing steering groups' (program  responsible  DLA).

This  is  also  linked  to  the  broader  problem  that  digital  transformation  further  increases the  importance  of  strategic  alignment  and  digital  competences  beyond  the  IT  department [11,  14,  37].  As  a  result  of  these  practice-based  and  theory-informed  insights,  the  definition  of  the  problem  instance  evolved  from  focusing  on  business-IT  alignment  to  focusing on  alignment  for  digital  transformation  through  vocational  training.  In  Table  3, we summarize insights from the literature on digital transformation, business-IT alignment, and  specific  contextual  requirements  into  meta-requirements  for  a  vocational  training program  that  aims  to  stimulate  alignment  for  digital  transformation.

## 4.2 Building,  Intervention  and  Evaluation  (BIE)

During  this  phase,  the  ADR  team  built  and  evaluated  the  artefact  presented  in  Table  4. The  ADR  team  selected  the  OECD  digital  government  policy  framework  [27] as the overarching  framework  for  designing  the  DLA  for  several  reasons.  First,  this  framework aligned  well  with  the  broader  policy  context,  particularly  the  digital  strategy  of  Digital

| MR2: Focus on specific public sector context            | ¥ Involve multiple government levels, and have a multi-actor view on alignment: involve a diverse array of political and administrative actors [19, 25, 36] ¥ Take into account the importance of the institutional environment [10, 19, 25, 36]                                       |
| MR3: Combine intended and emergent alignment actions    | Both intended actions (such as deliberately strengthening business and IT exchanges and interactions) and emergent actions (such as gaining understanding from past and current experiences, or decision-making on issues such as resource allocation) contribute to alignment [4, 20] |
| MR4: Focus on aligning on actors and aligning on tools  | Both actions focusing on actors (such as enabling mutual understanding through a 'joint' language) and actions focusing on tools (such as continuously evaluating the environment) contribute to alignment [5, 6, 20]                                                                  |

Flanders.  Unlike  indices  such  as  Europe's  Digital  Economy  and  Society  Index 1 ,  which primarily  focus  on  digital  public  service  delivery,  the  OECD  framework  emphasizes digital  transformation  more  broadly.  Second,  the  framework  provided  sufficient  flexibility  to  incorporate  specific  priorities  and  contextual  adaptations.  Third,  and  perhaps most  importantly,  the  OECD's  reputation  as  an  authoritative  source  ensured  credibility, reducing  the  perception  that  the  framework  was  solely  promoted  by  Digital  Flanders.

The ADR  team  actively  encouraged  organizations  to enroll multiple  employees, preferably  from  both  business  and  IT  domains.  It  is  encouraged  to  register  in  pairs:  a business  manager  together  with  an  IT  manager,  IT  architect  or  IT  project  leader  within the  same  entity.  This  approach  aimed  to  establish  a  critical  mass  within  organizations while  fostering  cross-disciplinary  collaboration.

During the implementation of the program, the ADR  team identified the need to engage the senior leadership of agencies in the digital transformation process. Participants in the DLA  frequently highlighted the necessity of support from their administrator-generals  to  drive  meaningful  organizational  change.  Moreover,  alignment among  administrator-generals  across  different  Flemish  agencies  was  also  essential.  In response,  the  ADR  team  introduced  a  series  of  high-level  seminars  tailored  for  senior

executives. Initially, this seminar  was  structured  as  a  condensed,  one-day  version  of the  DLA  program.  However,  it  became  evident  that  top  managers  required  a  different

approach.  Rather  than  a  broad  introduction  to  digital  transformation,  they  sought  continuous  insights  from  external  developments  on  how  emerging  technologies  could  shape future  operations.  As  a  result,  the  ADR  team  transitioned  the  so-called  'top  events'  to  a model  of  biannual  events,  targeting  a  cohort  of  approximately  90  top  managers  and  their direction  committees.  These  events  were  designed  to  address  pressing,  timely  issues, ensuring  an  externally  driven  and  dynamic  agenda.

In  addition,  a  request  from  local  government  representatives  led  to  the  development of  the  Filbert  goes  digital  training,  a  condensed  three-day  program  tailored  for  general managers  of  local  public  administrations.  This  initiative  further  underscored  the  need  for more  structural  involvement  of  local  government  public  servants  in  digital  leadership training. Beyond  their occasional role as guest speakers, local public servants were subsequently  invited  to  participate  in  DLA  training  sessions,  ultimately  comprising  1020%  of  each  DLA  cohort.  This  broader  inclusion  of  different  government  levels  enriched discussions,  fostering  a  more  integrated  perspective  on  how  various  levels  of  government contribute  to  user-centric  service  development.

The  program  evaluation  indicated  that  participants  particularly  valued  the  OECD digital  government  dimensions  for  their  practical  applicability.  Rather  than  being  perceived  as  a  purely  theoretical  framework,  the  dimensions  served  as  a  useful  checklist  for guiding  digital  transformation  projects  within  their  respective  organizations.

## 4.3 Reflection,  Learning  and  Formalization

We  summarized  what we learned from our four-year ADR  study in formal design principles in Table 5, following Gregor et al.'s [13] schema for specifying design principles.

The  importance  of  the  OECD  framework  for  structuring  the  DLA  cannot  be  underestimated  (DP1).  It  ensured  a  broad  focus  of  the  DLA  program  and  provided  a  joint language  focused  on  digital by design, data-driven, government  as  a platform,  open by  default,  user-driven  and  proactive  government  organization.  During  the  DLA  program,  participants  work  on  a  case,  an  innovative  public  service  idea  which  they  develop themselves,  in  groups.  This  helps  in  explicitly  bringing  the  different  aspects  of  the  program  together,  in  fostering  better  ties  between  the  participant  by  developing  something together,  and  in  making  the  OECD  framework  actionable  by  applying  it  (DP3).  Participants  testified  that  they  continue  to  use  the  OECD  framework  for  decision-making  on digital  transformation  in  their  own  organizations.  What  also  helped  to  create  a  mutual understanding  in  the  group  was  to  have  them  share  lived  experiences  from  the  COVIDperiod, a  disruption  that  on  the  one  hand  drove  IT-enabled  change,  and  on  the  other hand  led  to  quick  decisions  and  shortcuts  that  did  not  contribute  to  sustainable  digital transformation  (DP4).  In  addition,  this  reflection  on  past  experiences  was  complemented with  new  experiences,  such  as  a  3-day  design  sprint.

The  layered  approach  of  the  DLA,  consisting  of  different  programs,  also  proved to  be  important  (DP2),  since  all  government  levels  and  different  functions  within  each organization  needed  to  be  included,  but  appeared  to  require  a  different  approach.  The trainings  for  the  more  limited  amount  of  regional  government  agency  heads  focused  on bringing  this  entire  population  together  around  emerging  issues  in  the  external  environment.  The  trainings  for  the  IT  and  business  managers  and  policy  advisors  at  the  regional

## 5 Discussion  and  Outlook

This  article  set  out  to  investigate  how  public  sector  organizations  can  develop  training programs  that  foster  strategic  alignment  for  digital  transformation.  The  four-year  ADR research  at  Digital  Flanders  for  developing  the  DLA  resulted  in  two  types  of  insights: it  generates  design  knowledge  on  how  to  foster  alignment  for  digital  transformation  in vocational  training  programs,  and  it  enhances  our  descriptive  understanding  of  alignment for  digital  transformation  [12,  38].

## 5.1 Design  Knowledge

Throughout  the  ADR  process,  literature  on  digital  transformation  in  government  and business-IT  alignment  helped  to define the problem  and  explore  potential solutions. However,  there  was  little  existing  guidance  on  the  actual  design  process.  Our  study's primary  contribution  is  design  knowledge,  or  prescriptive  insights  [12,  38].  The  design principles  (DP1-DP5)  in  Table  5  offer  practical  guidelines  for  public  sector  organizations to  develop  training  programs  for  digital  transformation  that  meet  the  meta-requirements from  literature  summarized  in  Table  3.

## 5.2 Deeper  Understanding  of  Alignment  for  Digital  Transformation  in  the  Public Sector

Our  design  approach  provides  a  deeper  understanding  of  alignment  in  digital  transformation  in  the  public  sector,  particularly  regarding  which  actors  require  alignment  and the  types  of  alignment  actions  used.

Compared  to  business-IT alignment literature [1, 20, 29], digital transformation alignment  involves  a  broader  range  of  actors.  These  include  government  agency  heads, public managers with business and/or IT expertise, and provincial and municipal mangers.  While  political  actors  were  not  directly  present  in  the  program,  the  need  for alignment  between  administration,  policymakers  and  politicians  was  a  recurring  theme. Furthermore,  digital  transformation  alignment  places  greater  emphasis  on  coordination across  agencies  within  the  same  government  level  and  between  different  government levels  to  obtain  a  more  integrated  approach  to  governance.

Regarding alignment actions, the DLA  program  incorporates  both intended and emergent  alignment  actions,  focusing  on  aligning  both  tools  and  actors.  While  the  design principles  align  with  several  of  the  alignment  activities  identified  by  Karpovsky  and  Galliers  [20],  some  were  less  relevant  in  this  context,  and  additional  actions  specific  to  the public sector and digital transformation  were  necessary.  In  particular,  strengthening, learning,  evaluating,  developing  and  decision-making  emerged  as  key  alignment  activities.  The  DLA  program  placed  significant  emphasis  on  aligning  actors,  while  emergent alignment  with  tools  was  more  prominent  in  the  Top  Events.  A  notable  insight  is  that top  management  primarily  engaged  in  external  alignment  -  integrating  new  disruptions into  the  organization  -  while  business  and  IT  managers  focused  on  internal  alignment between  organizational  units.

A  key  contribution  of  this  research  is  its  emphasis  on  the  importance  of  smaller,  emergent  alignment  actions  in  digital  transformation,  contrasting  with  dominant  narratives that  often  highlight  large-scale,  disruptive  interventions  [14,  25,  37].  Notably,  certain major  alignment  actions  -  reconfiguring,  signaling  and  negotiating  [20]  were  absent. This is significant, as these actions, such as restructuring organizations (reconfiguring)  or  creating  new  roles  (signaling),  are  frequently  discussed  in  digital  transformation debates  [37].  The  absence  of  these  actions  can  be  partly  explained  by  the  scope  of  the program,  which  did  not  focus  on  the  digital  transformation  of  individual  organizations, but  rather  on  providing  organizational  actors  with  the  competences  necessary  to  do  so. However,  the  lack  of  explicit  political  alignment  (negotiating)  in  digital  transformation remains  a  striking  finding,  given  its  relevance  for  achieving  systemic  change.

## 6 Conclusion

Digital  transformation  in  government  aims  to  enhance  agility,  service  delivery,  and  collaboration but requires strategic alignment  across multiple actors and levels. Unlike business-IT  alignment,  which  focuses  predominantly  on  internal  coordination  within  a single  organization,  alignment  for  digital  transformation  in  the  public  sector  involves inter-organizational coordination and needs to account for the broader institutional environment,  including  governance  structures,  policymaking,  and  multi-level  decisionmaking. Despite its importance, practical guidance on fostering alignment remains scarce.

This  study  addresses  these  gaps  by  adopting  an  action  design  research  (ADR)  approach  to  explore  how  public  sector  organizations  can  develop  training  programs  that contribute to strategic alignment  in digital transformation. The  research is based on the  co-creation  of  the  Digital  Leaders  Academy,  a  vocational  training  program  that  has trained  over  330  senior  public  sector  professionals.

The  study  makes  two  contributions:  (1)  it  provides  practical  design  knowledge  in the form of design principles to support strategic alignment, and (2) it expands  the understanding  of  alignment  in  digital  transformation  by  identifying  the  actors  involved and  the  role  of  both  intended  and  emergent  alignment  actions.  The  findings  emphasize the  need  for  continuous  adaptation,  cross-level  coordination  and  actionable  strategies for  digital  transformation  in  government.

Abstract. The digital and sustainability transitions have attracted significant attention  from  the  public  sector  and  substantial  financial  investment.  These  transitions  are  of  critical  importance,  particularly  within  the  European  Union,  which  has introduced  a  range  of  legislations,  funding  programmes,  and  various  initiatives  to advance  them.  Notable  examples  include  the  European  Green  Deal,  which  focuses on  sustainability,  and  the  Digital  Europe  Programme,  which  aims  to  drive  digital transformation  and  innovation  within  the  public  sector.  While  recent  developments in both areas have gained increasing attention from the scientific  community, much  of  the  focus  has  been  placed  on  explaining  the  one  transition,  neglecting  the inherent  interconnection  between  these  twin  transitions  in  practice.  The  concept of  the  twin  transition  highlights  how  sustainable  and  digital  transformations  can complement  each  other.  Recent  studies  emphasise  the  importance  of  understanding  this  intersection,  particularly  in  how  technology  contributes  to  sustainability efforts  and  supports  sustainable  development.  In  this  study,  we  employ  exploratory single-case  study  research  of  the  city  of  Leuven  in  Belgium.  Based  on  our  analysis  and  findings  from  the  transition  management  literature  and  perspectives,  we explore  emerging  practices  and  understanding  of  civil  servants  in  the  twin  transition initiatives. We  found  that the twin transition in the  local  government  of Leuven  doesn't  have  a  coherent  strategic  vision,  and  it  is  rather  a  high-level  policy through  which  technology  is  seen  as  an  enabler  and  a  solution  to  environmental problems.

## 1 Introduction

The  ongoing  developments  in  digital  and  green  transitions  within  the  EU  have  led  to significant  investments  and  changes  in  policies  and  operations  at  various  levels,  including  EU,  national,  regional,  and  local.  The  challenges  posed  by  external  pressures,  such as  climate  change  and  progress  in  technological  advancements,  are  central  to  EU  policymaking  [1].  In  this  context,  the  European  Commission  has  introduced  the  European

green  transition

Green  Deal  as  a  cross-cutting  policy  to  achieve  climate  neutrality  and  promote  a  resourceefficient  and  competitive  economy  in  the  EU  [2].  At  the  same  time,  the  Digital  Agenda 2030  outlines  the  processes  and  regulations  that  will  facilitate  digital  transition  [3].  The connection  and  relationship  between  these  two  parallel  initiatives  in  both  theory  and practice  are  not  clearly  defined  [1].  Technology  is  often  seen  as  one  of  the  key  factors contributing  to negative  environmental  impacts  [4].  At  the  same  time,  it can also be regarded  as  an  essential  enabler  of  a  successful  green  transition  [5].

While  the  twin  transition  is  a  concept  coined  by  the  European  Union  in  order  to manage  the  ongoing  change  processes  in  the  green  and  digital  transition  [6],  there  are existing  ambiguities  between  the  supranational  (EU)  and  local  level  (cities)  [7].  The existing  EU  initiatives  are  created  to  support  twin  transition  in  local  governments,  such as  net-zero  cities  and  100  climate-neutral  and  smart  cities  [8].  Hence,  local  governments play  a  vital  role  in  the  twin  transition  [9,  10].  The  local  governments  in  the  digital  realm are  working  towards  transforming  and  achieving  smart  city  objectives;  in  parallel,  cities are  responsible  for  addressing  the  climate  change  challenges  and  reducing  environmental impact.  However,  there  is  a  limited  understanding  of  how  public  administrations  address twin  transition  initiatives,  both  theoretically  and  empirically,  and  what  capacities  and capabilities  are  required  for  effective  twin  transition  governance  [10-12].

In  this  study,  we  aim  to  fill  this  gap  by  investigating  a  single  case  of  Leuven  City  in Belgium.  The  novelty  of  this  study  is  that  it  focuses  on  a  single  case  study  that  provides an  in-depth  analysis  of  the  city's  empirical  practices  and  the  governance  approach  taken toward  the  twin  transition.  Our  objective  is  to  explore  the  empirical  institutional  practices  of  the  cross-sectional  study  of  the  city  of  Leuven,  and  we  base  our  discussion  on the  perspectives  of  the  twin  transition  in  public  administration  [10],  transition  spheres [13],  and  key  facets  of  transition  management  [12,  14].  Hence,  to  achieve  our  research objective,  we  ask,  'How  does  the  local  city  government  of  Leuven  address  the  twin transition  initiative,  and  what  are  the  key  practices?'.  While  the  roles  of  civil  servants are  less  explored  [12],  we  base  our  findings  on  the  semi-structured  interviews  with  the civil  servants  working  on  the  domains  related  to  twin  transition  initiatives,  such  as  smart city,  mobility,  IT  infrastructure,  circularity  and  energy.

This study is organised  as follows: Sect. 2 offers a  conceptual  overview  of  twin transition  and  its  various  perspectives  and  explores  transition  management  spheres  and key components.  Section  3 discusses the  methodological  approach  we  employed  in this  study.  In  Sect.  4,  we  present  our  findings  from  the  case  study.  Section  5  discusses the  findings  following  the  analytical  framework  posed  in  Sect.  2.  Last,  in  Sect.  6, we summarise  our  study  and  provide  concluding  remarks.

## 2 Conceptual  Overview

## 2.1 The  Twin  Transition:  Concept  and  Perspectives

With  the  simultaneous  advancements  in  both  digital  and  green  transitions,  there  is  growing  concern  and  interest  in  how  these  developments  affect  each  other  [1,  4,  15].  The  green transition  is  being  pursued  in  response  to  major  challenges  such  as  climate  change,  biodiversity  loss,  and  environmental  degradation.  It  is  understood  as  the  process  that  aims  to mitigate  climate  change  and  preserve  and  restore  nature  through  a  fundamental  shift  in

production  and  consumption  patterns  by  reducing  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  employing  renewable  energy  sources  [1,  6].  At  the  same  time,  the  digital  transition  is  fueled by  technological  advancements,  which  promise  increased  efficiency  and  improved  quality  of  life.  It  refers  to  a  process  aimed  at  enhancing  prosperity  and  addressing  societal challenges  through  the  use  of  digital  technologies  in  innovations  of  infrastructure,  services,  applications,  and  human  behaviour  [1,  6].  Hence,  [1]  defines  twin  transition  as the  following:  'The  twin  transition  is  about  how  the  dynamics  and  strength  of  the  digital transition  of  society  affect  the  green  transition  of  society,  and  how  these  two  transitions mutually  influence  each  other  and  should  be  combined  in  the  coming  years.'  (p.  12). Additionally,  the  role  of  technology  in  the  green  transition  is  often  viewed  in  two  contrasting  ways:  as  a  necessary  requirement  and  enabler  [16,  17]  or  as  a  negative  influencer, particularly  regarding  concerns  about  energy  footprints  [1,  18].

This  has  led  to  a  diversity  of  perspectives  on  technology's  role  and  purpose  in  promoting  green  and  sustainable  development  transitions  in  public  administration  and  public service  delivery  [10].  [10]  has  categorised  the  role  and  frame  of  technology  into  different  relationships,  including  viewing  technology  as  a  solution  or  a  problem  through different  conceptualisation  and  positions  within  systems,  either  as  an  instrument  or  an institution  (see  Table  1).  In  the  context  of  'technology  as  an  instrument  of  a  solution'  to achieve  a  green  and  sustainable  transition,  the  discussion  centres  around  the  perception of  technological  determinism  as  a  metanarrative  of  technological  progress  and  positive outcomes.  This  narrative  is  exemplified  in  particular  in  the  literature  on  the  smart  city,  in which  the  use  of  technologies  is  perceived  as  a  solution  for  the  realisation  of  sustainable development  goals.  Conversely,  in  the  context  of  'technology  as  an  instrument  of  a  problem',  the  discussion  centres  around  the  characteristics  of  technology  in  energy  resource consumption.  Thus,  the  perspective  emphasises  the  need  to  limit  the  negative  impacts of  using  ICT  in  public  administration,  such  as  data  warehouses  and  data  processing.

While  the previous two perspectives showcase  technology  as an instrument, the other  two  perspectives  discuss  technology  as  an  institution.  For  example,  machine  logic showcases  a  highly  critical view  of technology  and  argues  that  it is the leading  root cause  of  the  environmental  crisis.  The  critical  view  lies  within  the  logic  of  blind  faith  in technology  as  a  main  instrument  for  progress,  its  emphasis  on  continuous  growth,  and its  focus  on  short-term  outcomes.  Thus,  within  this  perspective  in  the  context  of  public administration,  'technology  soothes  our  pain  but  undermines  the  incentives  for  finding solutions'  [10].  This  perspective  of  the  negative  institutional  logic  also  has  its  counterpart in  the  perspective  of  constructive  logic,  in  which  the  technology  can  be  more  focused on  human-centred  and  sustainable  practices  within  the  ecology  [10].  It  highlights  the importance  of  a  comprehensive  and  long-term  approach  to  the  information  resources within  public  administration  [10].

## 2.2 Transition  Management:  Spheres  and  Key  Facets

Transition management  plays  a  crucial  role in implementing  the  transition activities and  achieving  transition  goals.  In  the  literature,  transition  management  is  understood as  an  analytical  and  prescriptive  approach  that  supports  the  identification  of  emerging practices  that  shape  long-term  sustainable  goals  [12].

Table  1. Relations  between  technology  (e-governance)  and  sustainable  development  ([10],  p.  39)

## Technology  as  an  instrument

| Technology as a problem   | Green IT Mitigating the negative effects of e-governance on sustainable development   | EGOV4SD E-governance as an instrument for realising sustainable development   | Technology as a solution   |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Technology as a problem   | Machine logic E-governance as a logic that is environmentally destructive             | Ecology logic E-governance as a logic that is environmentally constructive    | Technology as a solution   |

[13] developed a transition management  framework  that  illustrates various  governance  activities  influencing  long-term  sustainable  change  in  societies.  This  analytical  framework  supports  identifying  empirical  practices  through  which  societal  actors address  twin  transitions  at  different  levels.  The  framework  consists  of  three  key  spheres: strategic,  tactical,  and  operational.  The  strategic  sphere  involves  processes  such  as  vision development,  strategic discussions, the establishment  of collective goals,  and  normsetting. In this context, a key focus  is on a strategic  approach  to  norms,  values,  and ethics,  highlighting  sustainability's  relative  importance  for  society.  The  tactical  sphere includes steering  mechanisms  that  include  institutional patterns and structures, rules and  regulations,  organisations  and  networks,  infrastructures,  and  routines.  Here,  actors operate  across different levels  and  domains,  aiming  to  achieve  specific  and  concrete goals.  Operational  activities  include  experiments  and  actions  carried  out  in  the  context of  projects  and  programmes  and  are  often  referred  to  as  innovations  [13].

Although  [13]  identified  activities  associated  with  transitions,  the  framework  did  not explore  the  role  and  capacity  of  public  administration  in  facilitating  these  transitions.  [19] enhances  this  perspective  by  detailing  the  essential  elements  of  public  administration's capacities: roles, resources, and capabilities. Public administration can have various roles,  such  as  promoting  the  visions  of  sustainable  transition,  facilitator  of  green  transformation,  mediator  of  conflicts,  partner  builder  and  leader,  and  encouraging  widespread societal  engagement.  These  roles  align  with  the  overall  purpose  of  organisations,  which is  to  maintain,  change,  or  disrupt  institutions  [19].  Additionally,  [19]  argues  the  importance  of  resources  in  relation  to  the  transformative  capacity,  which  they  define  as  a  set of  material  or  immaterial  assets  available  to  an  organisation,  internally  or  externally. This  includes  inter-alia,  human  resources,  financial  resources,  physical  resources  and political  mandates.  However,  the  existing  roles  and  resources  cannot  be  utilised  without  a  set  of  routines,  practices  and  procedures  or  the  capabilities  of  organisations  [19, 20].  The  capabilities  identified  as  necessary  for  transformative  capacity  are  analytical, operational,  coordination,  learning  and  reflective  abilities  [19].  Additionally,  [21]  argue

that  transformative  and  transition  management  employs  four  key  capabilities:  strategy formulation,  sustainability  measurement,  collaboration  and  reflexive  capabilities.  Last but  not  least,  public  administration  contains  different  transition  tasks  [12]  in  the  form  of giving  direction,  creating  governance,  and  supporting  and  destabilising  or  developing internal  capabilities  and  structures.  Similarly,  [20]  argue  that  there  are  four  key  governance  tasks:  creating  leadership  and  legitimacy,  coordinating  actors  and  instruments, reflexivity,  learning  and  experimenting  and  resolving  conflicts.

We  established  our  analytical  framework  based  on  the  features  of  twin  transition  and transition  management  listed  above,  which  include  key  relationships  between  digital and  green  aspects  [10],  governance  spheres  and  their  activities  [13],  roles,  resources, abilities/capabilities  [12,  19,  21],  and  tasks  that  public  organisations  use  and  demand  for transitions  [12,  20].

## 3 Methodology

This  study  aims  to  identify  emerging  governance  activities  and  practices  in  the  twin  transition  in  the  local  government.  Thus,  this  study  employs  the  qualitative  interpretative exploratory  case  study  research  design  [22],  which  is  suitable  for  phenomena  requiring further  understanding  [23].  A  case  study  is  often  used  to  answer  the  how  and  why  questions  on  specific  phenomena,  in  our  case,  the  twin  transition  [23].  This  paper  is  based on  interpretative  philosophy,  in  which  authors  see  the  real  world  as  subjective  and  that it cannot  be  used  as  a generalisable  or  universal  truth.  Instead,  it  aims  to  provide  an understanding  of  the  phenomena  of  the  complex  world  [24].  The  cases  selected  within the  multiple-case  study  represent  different  socio-ecological  relations,  geographical  contexts,  and  administrative  traditions  [25]  and  rely  on  purposive  sampling.  Thus,  Leuven (Belgium)  was  selected  as  it  provides  a  separate  socio-ecological  relation  in  a  highly developed  country  with  a  northern-western  European  position  and  a  Napoleonic  administrative  tradition.  This  study  specifically  focuses  on  Leuven  as  a  case  through  which twin  transition  emerging  practices  are  assessed  in  detail.

Table  2. List  of  interviewees

| Interview   | Position                             |
|-------------|--------------------------------------|
| A           | Smart City Policy Advisor            |
| B           | Circularity Policy Advisor           |
| C           | Sustainability Energy Policy Advisor |
| D           | Mobility Policy Advisor              |
| E           | Life Pact coordinator                |
| F           | IT data city officer                 |
| G           | Leuven2030 representative            |

In regard to the data collection, this study relies  upon  semi-structured  in-person interviews  of  approximately  45-60  min,  as  well  as  desk  research,  which  included  the relevant  policy  documents  and  official  websites.  The  interviewees  are  the  city  officials responsible  for  the  digital  and  sustainability  domains  (energy,  circularity  and  mobility) (Table  2).  Interview  questions  have  been  developed  by  following  key  spheres  of  strategic, tactical  and  operational  elements  of  the  twin  transition  within  the  city  of  Leuven.  For example,  interviewees  were  asked  to  explain  the  role  of  the  city  in  the  formulation  of the  twin  transition  goals,  or  whether  the  city  has  developed  a  strategic  approach  towards twin  transition  objectives.

For  the  data  analysis,  we  developed  general  codes  representing  the  key  transition spheres,  which  include  general  codes  and  themes  of  Strategic,  Tactical  and  Operational spheres.  Additionally,  we  populated  the  general  codes  with  the  codes  of  public  administration  transition  roles,  resources,  abilities  and  tasks.  More  specifically,  we  followed  a content  analysis  approach  [26]  utilising  NVIVO  qualitative  coding  software.  The  coding procedures  followed  the  relevant  statements  and  sentences  from  the  selected  documents and  the  interviews.  The  coding  was  primarily  done  by  descriptive  coding,  which  includes the  basic  topic  of  a  passage  of  qualitative  data.

This  study  has  some  methodological  limitations  as  well.  Due  to  the  characteristics of  an  in-depth  exploratory  case  study,  its  findings  have  limited  generalizability.  While the  insights  gained  are  valuable  for  understanding  the  context  and  practices  of  the  city of  Leuven,  they  cannot  be  applied  to  all  local  governments  in  the  EU.  Additionally,  the interpretative  nature  of  this  study  introduces  the  possibility  of  researcher  bias  during both  data  collection  and  analysis.  Furthermore,  it  is  important  to  mention  that  while  the objective  of  this  paper  is  to  assess  institutional  local  government  practices  towards  twin transition,  the  limitation  may  also  be  with  the  interviewee's  lack  of  strategic  understanding,  as  we  have  not  been  able  to  have  interviews  with  the  leading  strategic  actors  within the  city  of  Leuven.  However,  to  partially  address  this  limitation  we  relied  upon  the  main strategic  documents  of  the  city  of  Leuven.

## 3.1 General  Characteristics  of  Leuven

Leuven  is  in  northwestern  Europe,  about  30  kms  east  of  Brussels,  Belgium,  and  covers an  area  of  56  km 2 .  With  just  over  100,000  residents,  it  is  seen  as  a  mid-sized  city  in Belgium,  and  its  population  continues  to  grow  [27].  The  city  is  well  known  for  its  strong academic  reputation,  mainly  because  it  is  home  to  KU  Leuven,  one  of  the  top  universities in  the  world.  KU  Leuven  has  around  70,000  students,  many  of  whom  come  from  outside the city, making  it an important  academic  centre  that adds to Leuven's  cultural and intellectual  life.  The  university  also  supports  the  local  economy  through  research-based spin-off  companies  [27].  Dutch  is  the  main  language  spoken  in  Leuven,  as  it  is  part  of  the Flemish  region  of  Belgium.  At  the  same  time,  the  city  is  shaped  by  Belgium's  complex political  system,  which  includes  three  regions-Flanders,  Wallonia,  and  Brussels-and three  language  communities-Dutch,  French,  and  German.  These  divisions  affect  how policies  and  decisions  are  made  at  the  local  level.

The  city  has  a  long  history,  with  many  old  buildings  and  narrow  medieval  streets still  visible  today.  Leuven  is  not  only  a  centre  for  education  and  research  but  also  plays a  growing  role  in  areas  like  environmental  planning  and  innovation.  About  42%  of  the

city's  land  is  green  space,  which  is  the  second  highest  in  Flanders  after  Genk  [27].  The city's  work  in  innovation  and  sustainability  has  received  several  awards.  In  2019,  the European  Commission  named  Leuven  the  European  Capital  of  Innovation,  a  prize  given to  the  city  that  best  uses  innovation  to  solve  public  challenges  and  improve  people's lives  [28].  In  2018,  Leuven  also  won  the  European  Green  Leaf  Award,  which  recognises smaller  cities  for  their  efforts  in  sustainability  and  quality  of  life  [29].  More  recently, Leuven  was  chosen  as  one  of  100  European  Mission  cities  aiming  to  become  climateneutral  by  2030.

## 4 Findings

## 4.1 Strategic  Level

Leuven's  approach  towards  the  twin  transition  showcases  prioritisation  within  the  green transition  with  the  support  of  digital  technologies.  The  city  of  Leuven  lacks  a  unified strategic  framework  that  explicitly  addresses  both  transitions  simultaneously.  However, numerous  initiatives  are  driving  progress  in  both  areas  (as  discussed  in  4.3  Operational level).  In  the  context  of  the  twin  transition,  the  city  prioritises  the  sustainability  transition, aiming  to  achieve  climate  neutrality  by  2030  [30].  As  part  of  its  green  transition,  the city  has  expanded  its  green  spaces  to  cover  42.7%  of  its  total  area,  making  it  one  of the  greenest  cities  among  the  Flemish  central  cities  [27].  The  city  is  also  adapting  to the  impacts  of  climate  change,  preparing  for  increased  risks  of  flooding,  droughts,  and heatwaves,  with  the  average  temperature  expected  to  rise  by  6  ¡C  by  2100  [27].  In  tandem with  this,  Leuven  is  also  exploring  innovative  digital  solutions  to  enhance  access  to  public services  and  integrate  information  and  communication  technologies  (ICTs)  into  urban management,  for  which  the  city  was  awarded  as  the  most  innovative  city  in  Europe  in 2020  [31].

The  strategic  conceptualisation  of  the  twin  transition  does  not  exist  at  the  city  level. Within  this context, the prevailing narrative suggests  that digital  transformations  are seen mainly as a generic horizontal enabler of the broader sustainability transition, supporting  efforts  to  achieve  environmental  goals  through  improved  efficiency  and  datadriven  solutions.  Smart  City  Policy  Advisor  has  pointed  this  out  as  follows:

'Green transition as a vertical is something of a thematic approach. I would see digital as an enabler in a lot of things, especially focusing on sustainability like renewables, energy, local energy communities, local energy production and these things.' (Interview  A).

Thus,  in  the  context  of  perspectives  of  the  twin  transition  in  public  administration based  on  [10]  the  conceptualisation  of  the  twin  transition  in  Leuven  is  shaped  by  the  city officials'  understanding  of  both  sustainability  and  digital  transitions.  The  green  transition is  framed  as  a  comprehensive  concept  encompassing  key  environmental  objectives,  such as reducing  CO2  emissions,  alongside  targeted,  sustainable  strategies across various sectors,  such  as  mobility  and  circularity  (Interview  C).  These  strategies  include  mobility improvements,  reducing  traffic  congestion,  and  circular  activities.  The  Circularity  Policy Advisor  addressed  the  green  transition  as  follows:

'[..], to me, green means, like everything related to sustainability, you know, both in terms of circular economy, in terms of energy, but also in nature-based solutions, the greening of the city, etc., so in the widest sense.' (Interview  B).

In regard  to the roles in twin transitioning, Leuven  also  plays  a  crucial role as a facilitator  of  twin  transition  activities.  The  city  actively  supports  and  enables  these  efforts by  providing  workspace  for  civil  society  organisations  focused  on  sustainability  and digital initiatives. Moreover,  Leuven  acts  as  a partner bridge, fostering relationships between  businesses  and  citizens  while  connecting  innovative  green  and  digital  solutions with  those  who  need  them  most.  The  city  is  recognised  as  a  'living  lab'  and  a  frontrunner in  testing  and  applying  new  technologies.  As  the  mobility  policy  advisor  put  it:

'[…] we are really open to testing it in the real life of the city of Leuven as a living lab, and in that perspective, I think the city of Leuven is truly a frontrunner in embracing new technologies that support the transition to sustainable mobility […]' (Interview  D).

Additionally,  Leuven  serves  as  an  implementer  of  the  twin  transition.  Through  its governance  and  public  administration  roles,  the  city  directly  shapes  the  course  of  this transformation.  As  'market  masters'  of  the  public  domain  (Interview  D),  the  city  administration  plays  a  pivotal  role  in  guiding  sustainability  and  digital  projects.  These  initiatives span  various  sectors  and  levels  of  implementation,  with  many  falling  under  the  so-called Climate  City  Contract  [30].

Additionally,  the  interviewees  highlighted  that  political  changes  do  not  influence  the twin  transition  efforts.  As  the  Life  Pact  coordinator  noted:

'So we now have the climate contract signed by Europe, and we've got a lot of projects being set up to scale up. We've signed this contract, and we need to do as much as we can. Fortunately, this contract is not bound to politicians but to the city of Leuven. Even after elections, if there are political changes, the Climate City contract remains an obligation we have committed to' (Interviewee  E).

## 4.2 Tactical  Level

Even after elections, if there are political changes, the Climate City contract remains an obligation we have committed to' (Interviewee  E).

## 4.3 Operational  Level

Leuven  is  actively  implementing  various  twin  transition  projects  that  integrate  green and  digital  solutions  to  foster  sustainability  and  innovation.  A  notable  initiative  is  Urban Sense,  which  uses  a  network  of  sensors  to  collect  real-time  data  on  air  quality,  mobility, and energy consumption.  This platform supports smart urban planning by enabling data-driven  decisions  and  aligning  digital  tools  with  the  city's  sustainability  goals  [33].

Another  significant  project  is  Leuven  Cool,  which  deploys  80  sensors  across  public and  private  spaces  to  monitor  heat,  humidity,  and  the  urban  heat  island  effect.  The  data helps  shape  the  city's  greening  strategies,  especially  to  protect  vulnerable  populations, such  as  the  elderly  and  young  children,  by  identifying  where  heat  risks  are  highest.  This project  demonstrates  the  integration  of  digital  data  collection  with  environmental  actions to  enhance  climate  resilience.  The  Leuven2030  representative  mentioned  this  project  as well:

'Leuven Cool, where we have, I think, 80 sensors in the public and private areas spread out on the Leuven territory, measuring all kinds of stuff, heat, island, effect, humidity, and that is data that we scrape to see how the greening strategy of the city of Leuven could evolve. Where is the heat island effect? Where are our most vulnerable inhabitants? Where are the elderly homes? Where are the, how you call that, where babies are taking care of during the day? Yeah, where are the kindergartens?  And  so,  yeah,  where  do  we  develop  what  greening  strategy  to protect the most vulnerable, for example?' (Interview G).

Another  example  of  the  twin  transition  project  is  a  waste  management  pilot  project involving local hospitals and the materials bank has focused on  improving  material sorting  and  recycling,  using  AI  to  enhance  the  reuse  of  plastics,  wood,  and  other  materials (Interview  B). Additionally,  KU  Leuven  contributes  to  these  efforts  through  its research  and  development  projects.  More  specifically,  the  KU  Leuven  project  focuses on  developing  advanced  computer  vision  and  X-ray  tomography  (XRT)  imaging  technologies  to  improve  sorting  and  recycling  processes  in  the  circular  economy.  The  project specifically  targets  complex  waste  streams  like  electronic  devices  and  batteries  to  create  fully  autonomous  systems  for  material  dismantling  and  sorting.  By  applying  AI,  the project  seeks  to  enhance  the  efficiency  and  accuracy  of  recycling,  supporting  sustainable practices  and  reducing  waste  through  innovative  digital  solutions.

Citizen  participation  is  a  crucial  element  of  Leuven's  twin  transition,  where  local residents  actively  contribute  to  urban  sustainability  projects.  Over  the  last  15  to  20  years, the  city  has  adopted  a  bottom-up  approach,  ensuring  that  citizens'  voices  are  integrated into  decisions  about  public  spaces,  mobility,  and  greening  initiatives  [27]  citizens'  participation can also be noticeable  through  the  quadruple  and  triple helix projects and approaches  of  Leuven2030  and  Leuven  Mindgate.

As  a  Life  Pact  coordinator  (Interview  E)  noted,  while  awareness  of  climate  change is  generally  high,  not  all  citizens  are  equally  involved,  with  some  showing  a  ' lack of interest' or  adopting  a  ' not in my backyard' mentality.  However,  in  areas  like  KesselLo, residents have been highly proactive, asking for greener streets, reduced  traffic, and  participating  in  community-led  projects  that  use  local  budgets  to  transform  public spaces.

Leuven's  Department  of  Participation  plays  a  key  role  in  facilitating  this  engagement, employing  neighbourhood  managers  who  act  as  liaisons  between  the  city  and  residents. These  managers  help  organise  workshops,  events,  and  informal  sessions  where  citizens can  voice  their  concerns  and  propose  ideas  for  improving  their  local  environment.  For instance,  the  city  organised  community  neighbourhood  challenges  to  promote  naturefriendly  gardening  in  private  gardens.  In  some  cases,  as  noted  in  interviews,  resistance to city projects arises due to differing visions among  residents. For example,  while some  neighbourhoods  embraced  greening  initiatives,  others  were  more  resistant  due to concerns  about  changes  in their streets. The  Life  Pact  coordinator  mentioned  the following:

'Additionally, the city adapts by holding extra workshops to maintain support, adjusting plans when necessary, and ensuring that all voices are heard, even if consensus cannot always be reached. This participatory process ensures that projects remain flexible, community-oriented, and balanced between public ambitions and citizen desires.' (Interview E).

Regarding  resources  evaluation,  human  resources  in  Leuven's  twin  transition  highlights progress and persistent gaps, particularly in digital transformation. One key improvement  has  been  adding  IT  support  within  the  city's  administration.  Smart  City Policy  Advisor  (Interview  A)  noted,  ' When I started, I had nobody in IT to support me, and now I have somebody… That's a nice step up.' However,  this  progress  is  not  uniform  across  all  areas.  While  there  is  a  growing  focus  on  sustainability,  digital  expertise remains  limited,  particularly  in  key  departments  where  knowledge  of  critical  tools  like data  warehouses  is  retained  by  external  consultants  rather  than  in-house  staff.

This reliance on external consultants challenges  the city's capacity to mature  its digital  strategies.  The  IT  data  city  officer  explained,  ' We pay for a consultant… If we hadthat knowledge in-house… we would have maturity.' (Interview  F).  The  city's  ability to  attract  and  retain  highly  skilled  personnel  in  specialised  fields,  such  as  energy  markets and  digital  innovation,  is  further  hindered  by  competition  with  the  private  sector,  where salaries  and  resources  often  exceed  those  of  government  positions.  This  human  capital challenge  extends  to  areas  of  sustainability  and  circular  economy  projects,  where  the  city has  had  difficulty  filling  key  roles  needed  to  drive  forward  the  twin  transition  agenda. Despite  these  challenges,  there  is  recognition  of  the  need  to  build  internal  expertise  to support  long-term,  sustainable  growth  in  both  green  and  digital  domains.

Data  management  presents  a  further  challenge  in  Leuven's  twin  transition  efforts. One interviewee pointed out that the city often lacks ownership over critical data resources,  which  hampers  its  ability  to  fully  leverage  digital  solutions  in  achieving  its sustainability  goals.  As  expressed  in  the  quote  of  the  Sustainability  Policy  Officer,  ' We don't have the data, and we are also not the data owners' (Interview  C);  this  limitation

restricts  the  city's  capacity  to  create  data-driven  strategies  and  innovations.  Ensuring access  to  reliable,  owned  data  and  building  stronger  financial  support  frameworks  will be  key  to  overcoming  these  obstacles  and  advancing  Leuven's  twin  transition.

## 5 Discussion

In  this  study,  we  aim  to  explore  emerging  governance  practices  and  activities  and  key aspects of transition management  for  local  twin transitions in Leuven.  Our  findings indicate  that  the  twin  transition  among  civil  servants  is  assessed  rather  fragmentally,  as the  developments  in  green  transition  are  supported  and  enabled  by  digital  technologies.

Thus,  the  conceptualisation  of  digital  transition  is  framed  in  two-fold  terms  among city  officials.  Firstly,  the  digital  transition  is  understood  as  the  supporting  mechanism  for data-driven  decision-making  within  the  city.  The  city  decision-making  structures  aim  to rely  on  digital  technologies  and  data  to  make  more  founded  decisions  with  the  support of  innovative  technologies  and  successes  like  the  Digital  Twin  projects.  Secondly,  the digital  transition  is  understood  as  a  facilitator  and  enabler  for  general  business  processes and  objectives.  In  summary,  while  the  twin  transition  has  not  been  systematically  or strategically  addressed,  it  is  reflected  in  the  'people's  mind'  and  activities  of  the  city's sustainability  policy  departments  and  its  ongoing  digital  developments.  Thus,  following  [10]  discussion  on  perspective,  this  perspective  aligns  with  the  'technology  as  an instrument  for  a  solution'  in  twin  transitions  perspectives,  which  looks  at  technologies as  positive  instruments  in  enabling  horizontal  policies  of  green  and  sustainable  transition.  In  this  context,  technology's  negative  effects  are  neither  openly  perceived  nor emphasised  in  any  strategic  documents  nor  within  the  interviews.

We  also  found  that  the  strategic  governance  orientation  of  the  twin  transition  has  not been  fully  implemented.  This  observation  aligns  with  findings  indicating  that  while  conceptual  coherence  regarding  the  twin  transition  exists,  operational  coherence  lags  behind [34],  even  at  the  local  government  level.  In  the  tactical  realm,  the  fragmented  approach is  evident  in  the  strategic  documents,  which  tend  to  separately  address  the  goals  and visions  related  to  either  green  transitioning  or  digital  transitioning.  At  this  level,  the  collaborative  governance  approach  to  addressing  the  green  transition  is  noticeable  through operational  activities  in  forming  quadruple-helix  initiatives,  such  as  Leuven2030.  In  the operational  realm,  initiatives  drive  developments,  particularly  in  specific  policy  areas such  as  circularity,  mobility,  and  smart  city  initiatives.  These  findings  reinforce  the  conclusions  made  by  [21],  who  argue  the  importance  of  a  more  collaborative  and  networked governance  that  involves  both  internal  and  external  stakeholders.  However,  there  is  a need  for  a  more  strategic  focus  on  the  aspects  and  visions  related  to  twin  transitions [21].

Our  study  highlights  the  key  aspects  of  transition  management,  as  discussed  in  [12, 20,  35].  The  findings  indicate  that  the  city  of  Leuven  plays  a  purposeful  role  in  both maintaining  and  transforming  the  institutions  involved  in  the  two  aspects  of  the  transition  [19].  The  city  administration  in  Leuven  acts  as  a  facilitator  and  partner  builder  in engaging  with  the  internal  and  external  stakeholders  within  the  initiatives  and  projects related  to  digital  support  for  the  green  transition.  Furthermore,  regarding  resources,  the city  primarily  depends  on  human  resources.  However,  due  to  the  size  of  the  government,  managing  these  resources  presents  challenges,  in  addition  to  the  data  and  data

management  requirements  for  a  successful  twin  transition.  In  terms  of  capabilities,  the city  relies  upon  a  necessary  leadership  capability  and,  in  particular,  dynamic  capabilities in  the  forms  of  analytical  capabilities  necessary  for  exploring  new  methods  of  working (in  the  case  of  a  circular  economy),  collaborative  capability  and  reflexive  capability  in forms  of  leadership  for  twin  transition  [12,  21].

Besides  having  the  capabilities  in  terms  of  access  to  technologies  and  the  strategic  orientation  towards  addressing  environmental  sustainability,  the  city  of  Leuven  and similar  local  governments  may  address  the  following.  Local  governments  may  take  into consideration  that  the  twin  transition  objectives  may  require  a  consistent  governance approach  in  the  form  of  a  multi-sectoral  working  group  which  takes  into  account  several important  sectors,  such  as  energy,  mobility,  and  geo-information.  Furthermore,  the  local governments  may  further  work  on  data  and  knowledge  exchange,  as  multiple  interviewees  mentioned  the  lack  of  knowledge  and  information  exchange  on  the  other  projects, which  led  to  multiplicity  of  solutions,  in  particular  when  it  comes  to  digitalising  products or  services.  Therefore,  the  local  governments  could  put  more  efforts  into  establishing interoperability,  which  refers  to  the  abilities  of  the  organisations  to  exchange  and  use knowledge,  information  and  services  for  mutually  beneficial  objectives.

## 6 Conclusion

While  parallel initiatives in the EU  in the  green  and  digital  domains  are  happening, logical questions  arise about  how  these  initiatives influence others.  The  term  coined by  the  European  Union,  twin  transition  [6],  aims  to  address  the  challenges  associated with potential incoherence  between  two  big  objectives.  Twin  transition  is  defined  as ' how the  dynamics  and  strength  of  the  digital  transition  of  society  affect  the  green transition of society, and how these two transitions mutually influence each other and should  be  combined  in  the  coming  years.'  (p.  12) [1]. However,  there are existing dissimilarities  between  the  EU  initiatives  and  local  developments  [34,  35],  and  research on  local  government  practices  in  the  twin  transition  is  currently  lacking.  Thus,  employing an  exploratory  case  study  research  design  aims  to  address  the  mentioned  gap  by  trying to  answer  the  posed  RQ: How does the local city government of Leuven address the twin transition initiative, and what are the key practices?

The  research  findings  indicate  that  the  city  of  Leuven  has  an  asymmetrical  approach towards  twin  transition.  This  indicates  that  disintegrated  management  has  no  particular  focus  on  a  strategic  vision  to  twin  transition  aspects.  Rather,  civil  servants  identify digital  transformation  as  an  instrument  of  a  solution  to  the  green  transition  challenges faced.  Thus,  our  findings  indicate  that  in  the  city  of  Leuven,  the  twin  transition  is  perceived  as  a  technological  support  and  instrument  for  solving  environmental  problems [10]. Additionally,  the strategic orientation  showcases  the  focus  on  the  collaborative management  between  the  internal  (city  departments)  and  external  actors  (Flanders,  EU level)  through  its  quadruple  or  triple  helix  initiatives  (such  as  Leuven  2030).  Moreover, our findings  indicate  that the role of the city often lies  in  maintaining  the  institution and  partner  builder,  which  aims  to  ensure  the  transformations  for  the  citizens'  benefit and  engage  in  co-production  or  collaborative  processes.  Additionally,  resources  are  an important  factor  in  the  twin  transition,  and  in  the  city  of  Leuven,  human  resources  are

often  regarded  as  important  in  addition  to  data  resources.  Regarding  the  necessary  capability,  the  analytical,  collaborative  and  reflexive  capabilities  are  regarded  as  important  to achieving  twin  transition  objectives.  Although  there  are  high  policy  initiatives  on  twin transition,  in  practice  in  the  city  of  Leuven,  the  digital  and  green  transitions  are  governed as  separate  initiatives,  with  the  primary  focus  of  the  digital  transition  in  support  of  the green  transition  and  mitigating  environmental  challenges.

However,  due  to  the  existing  findings  mentioned  above  and  limitations  of  this  study, such  as  a  lack  of  generalizability,  potential  research  bias  and  interviewee  selection,  we have  few  suggestions  for  future  research.  Future  studies  may  investigate  the  relationships and  reasons  behind  the  city  officials'  positive  approaches  towards  technological  changes, and  also  investigate  the  potential  negative  impacts  of  the  twin  transition  in  the  EU,  as the  negative  effects  are  mainly  neglected.  Furthermore,  future  studies  may  include  the process  tracing  methodology  in  comparative  studies  to  establish  a  further  understanding of  the  causation  of  the  twin  transition  approaches  in  public  administration.

Abstract. Digital  citizen  participation  has  attracted  scientific  interest  for  decades, particularly  as  participation  platforms  have  been  implemented  and  adopted  in  the public  sector.  Although  progress  has  been  made  to  overcome  immature  technology  and  low  user-friendliness,  digital  citizen  participation  still  faces  challenges. The  promising  potential  to  enhance  co-creation  and  create  public  value  is  often not  realised.  Various  forms  of  citizen  participation,  including  the  digital  platforms used,  need  to  be  further  explored.  In  our  theoretically  informed  case  study,  we  use the  3A 3 framework  (Actors,  Arenas,  Aims),  comparing  two  distinct  digital  participation  initiatives  within  the  same  municipal  context.  Our  contribution  highlights how  differences  in  rationale,  structure,  and  interpretation  of  citizen  input  leads to  divergent  outcomes,  either  as  optimisation  (structured,  goal-oriented  participation)  or  innovation  (open,  creative  participation).  We  also  demonstrate  the  organisational  challenges  of  adapting  to  open  models  of  participation  and  how  managed participation  fits  more  easily  into  existing  bureaucratic  structures.  For  municipalities  and  policy  makers,  we  offer  practical  insights  on  how  to  design  and  implement digital  participation  initiatives  that  are  both  meaningful  and  manageable.

## 1 Introduction:  The  Challenge  of  Digital  Citizen  Participation in  Digital  Government

The  public  sector  is  under  pressure  due  to  complex,  economic,  environmental,  and  societal challenges [1]. One  way  to strengthen democracy  and  give the opportunity for citizens  to  influence  policy  impact  has  been  digital  participation  [2-4].  Citizen  participation  carries  ambitions  of  addressing  the  issue  of  distrust  and  to  facilitate  social  change [5,  6],  and  many  scholars  have  suggested  that  digital  technologies  can  improve  citizen participation  [7,  8].

Digital  government  has  moved  from  the  digitizing  of  government  services,  to  exploring  how  information  and  communication  technologies  (ICT)  can  drive  transformative

This  evolution  encompasses  enhancing  service  delivery  to  integration  of  'the  digital'  into  governance  processes  and  leveraging  advanced algorithms  and  AI  [9-11].  The  implementation  of  digital  participation  platforms  is  driven by  the  objective  of  reinforcing  the  democratic  dialogue  and  enhancing  the  level  of  participation  in  decision-making  processes  [12],  increase  the  quality  and  anchoring  of  policies but  also  to  enhance  legitimacy  and  trust  for  the  democratic  processes  [2,  13].

To foster digital participation, a paradigm shift is required from traditional approaches  to  digital  transformation  in  government.  It  means  that  public  organizations need  to  adopt  new  roles,  by  becoming  more  interactive  and  facilitative  ([14,  15],  while also  embracing  greater  openness  and  transparency  [16-18].  For  a  shift  to  happen  in  how participation  is  shaped  and  understood,  technology,  people,  and  processes  need  to  be integrated  [19],  implementing  new  technology  alone  will  not  redefine  the  value  propositions  [20].  When  adopting  participation  in  a  public  organisation  there  needs  to  be  an understanding  of  the  conditions  that  shape  the  digital  transformation  process,  as  well  as the  underlying  democratic  and  political  rules  that  govern  it  [21,  22].

There  is  a  lack  of  understanding  of  how  different  types  of  digital  participation  initiatives  function  in  terms  of  their  structure,  purpose,  and  outcomes.  Existing  research  often treats  digital  participation  as  a  monolithic  concept,  without  sufficiently  distinguishing between  open-ended  and  guided  forms  of  participation  or  analyzing  how  these  differences  affect  implementation  and  impact.  In  this  study  I  compare  two  cases  of  digital citizen  participation  implemented  in  a  Swedish  municipality.  The  ambition  is  to  explore and  understand  how  they  are  shaped  by  analysing  them  across  arenas,  actors  and  aims. Thus,  the  present  study  focuses  on  the  following  research  question:

What  are  the  most  significant  differences  between  open  and  guided  digital  citizen participation  initiatives  and  how  do  these  differences  manifest?

## 2 Digital  Platforms  for  Citizen  Participation

There  are  many  reasons  why  governments  try  to  pursue  digital  citizen  participation,  to foster  trust  and  revitalise  local  democracy  [5,  6],  but  it  is  also  as  a  way  to  develop  digital services  [23]  spur  co-creation  [3]  or  discuss  urban  planning  [24].  The  use  of  platforms for  digital  participation  emerging  in  the  late  2000s  [25]  has  led  to  an  intense  exploration where  governments  try  to  enhance  digital  citizen  participation  [7,  8],  including  hopes for  better  inclusion  of  marginalized  groups  [26],  lowering  barriers  of  participation  [27], driving cost-effective participation and participation of scale [28]. But despite years of  investment  in  digital  transformation  initiatives,  there  are  deep-seated  issues  such  as institutional  readiness  that  hinder  digitalisation  [29,  30]  and  digital  government  adoption is  still  low  [31].

From  the  classical  work  of  Arnstein,  power  and  decision-making  are  central  themes that  constitute  the  target  of  citizen  participation  [32].  Today  many  citizen  participation initiatives  have  a  consultative  role  rather  than  an  impact  on  decisions  [33],  sometimes even  the  consultative  part  is  absent,  and  governments  implement  citizen  participation initiatives  to  legitimise  decisions  [22,  34].  In  this  study  digital  citizen  participation  is aligned  with  the  definition  'the  extension  and  transformation  of  participation  in  societal democratic  and  consultative  processes  mediated  by  information  and  communication

technologies  (ICT),  primarily  the  Internet.  It  aims  to  support  active  citizenship  with  the latest  technology  developments,  increasing  access  to  and  availability  of  participation  in order  to  promote  fair  and  efficient  society  and  government.'  [35].

The  digital platforms  used  in  our study  collect the  opinions  from  citizens  on  the behalf  of  the  city  and  government,  but  they  also  encourage  and  provide  a  channel  for involvement  in  the  development  of  the  city  [36,  37].  Platforms  have  both  been  categorised and evaluated in prior research, but there is still no common  way  of  doing  so [21, 25, 37]. Previous  research  disagrees  on  the  ability  of citizen participation  to  address citizens'  interests,  some  show  how  it  can  lead  to  social  change  [38],  while  others  claim that  citizen  participation  empowers  the  already  privileged  [33].  Reasons  why  platforms are  not  used  and  therefore  not  making  an  impact  can  relate  to  issues  of  trust  [39],  low involvement,  poor  design  and  technology  know-how,  these  have  all  been  found  critical factors  for  successful  digital  participation  [40-46].  Usability  and  simplicity  are  factors that  influence  how  one  gets  involved,  but  there  are  also  in-depth  studies  that  show  that details  in  the  functionality  can  be  decisive  [47],  and  minor  changes  can  make  differences in  participant  behavior  [48].

Research  supports  the  idea  that  using  digital  participation  platforms  can  attract  new groups  to  be  involved  in  planning,  better  reach  out  with  planning  projects  and  ideas  but also  gather  local  knowledge  and  build  trust  [49].  Urban  developments  are  important  to  the government,  and  as  it  affects  the  everyday  life  of  the  citizens,  they  also  have  incentives  for being  engaged  [28].  But  although  platforms  and  technologies  have  evolved,  the  organizational  and  contextual  factors  that  shape  their  effectiveness  remain  underexplored.  There is  limited  empirical  insight  into  how  municipalities  integrate  these  platforms  into  their governance  processes,  and  how  this  integration  (or  lack  thereof)  influences  the  success of  participation  efforts.  In  this  study,  we  do  not  focus  specifically  on  the  technical  design or  use  of  the  participation  platforms,  as  the  literature  shows  that  digital  systems  per  se do  not  successfully  involve  citizens  despite  their  potential  for  large-scale  participation. Instead,  we  see  the  platform  in  its  context,  and  its  integration  into  the  organization.

## 3 Research  Design

## 3.1 Research  Setting

We  conducted  our  study  in  a  medium-sized  Swedish  municipality  with  around  100,000 inhabitants  and  6,000  employees,  between  January  and  June  2023.  We  are  studying  two citizen  participation  initiatives,  we  call  them  'Case  1  -  Citizen  Dialogue'  and  'Case 2  -  Comprehensive  Plan'.

## Case  1  -  Citizen  Dialogue

The  citizen  dialogue  is  held  in  different  parts  of  the  municipality  and  each  dialogue  lasts for  a  period  of  six  weeks  when  citizens  can  meet  civil  servants  and  politicians  in  open forums  or  add  their  proposals  in  the  digital  participation  platform  used  for  the  dialogue. This  hybrid  type  of  dialogue  means  that  several  meetings  are  held  combined  with  the digital platform  open  for  proposals.  The  budget  to  finance  citizens  proposals  is  0,43 MEUR  per  year  and  funding  decisions  are  made  by  a  board  of  politicians.  This  form  of dialogue  originates  from  policies  that  imposes  participatory  decisions  between  elections

[26]  but  also  a  strong  tradition  of  participation  and  the  view  of  citizens  as  active  creators of  their  society  [33].

The  platform  used  in  this  initiative  is  built  on  a  global  open-source  platform  called Decidim  [25].  The  platform  was  introduced  in  this  Swedish  municipality  in  2019  and implemented  because  the  pandemic  restricted  how  the  municipality  could  meet  with citizens.  The  platform  is  governed  by  civil  servants  and  in  the  platform  anyone  can  post and  search  for  proposals.  If  you  are  registered,  proposals  can  be  followed  or  commented on  but  there  is  no  voting  for  proposals.  There  are  no  restrictions  for  what  proposals  that can  be  posted  but  there  are  guidelines  to  support  the  users.  The  citizen  participation  in this  initiative  is  open  and  created  by  the  municipality  to  listen  and  understand  its  citizens better  and  provide  a  channel  for  impact.

## Case  2  -  Comprehensive  Plan

During  spring  2023,  the  municipality  carried  out  a  dialogue  to  give  citizens  the  chance to  participate  in  creating  the  new  comprehensive  plan.  The  comprehensive  plan  is  regulated  in  the  Planning  and  Building  Act  and  the  Environmental  Code  [50].  The  creation of  the  comprehensive  plan  is  extensive  since  it  includes  many  important  decisions  such as  guidelines  for  sustainable  development  and  how  to  preserve  the  existing  environment. The  platform  used  for  this  dialogue  is  called  Placetoplan  [25].  The  platform  was  introduced  to  engage  citizens  and  collect  their  ideas  exclusively  for  the  comprehensive  plan. The  platform  was  proposed,  published,  governed  and  edited  by  consultants.  Citizens could  access  the  platform,  navigate  via  a  map  and  respond  to  predefined  questions  or add  comments  connected  to  an  area  on  the  map.

## 3.2 The  3A 3 -framework  of  Participation

To  be  able  to  compare  the  two  cases  of  digital  citizen  participation  initiatives,  we  use the  conceptual  framework  called  3A 3 -framework  of  participation  [51].  The  framework builds on Arnstein's seminal  paper  on the participation ladder [32],  to  combine  and unpack  the  concept  of  participation.  The  framework  consists  of  three  components:  the surrounding  context,  the  planning  process  itself  and  third,  the  participation  process.  The participation  process  is  divided  into  three  dimensions  of  participation  (Fig.  1);  actors, who  participates, 'who?',  their roles and how  they are recruited to participate.  The

second  dimension  is  Arenas  which  deals  with  the  structure  of  the  participation  process, 'how?'.  It  tries  to  capture  the  places,  the  form,  and  the  rhythm.  The  third  dimension  is Aims,  'Why?',  and  deals  with  the  issues,  motives  and  outcomes  of  participation.  These should  be  seen  as  a  network  of  interactions  between  the  different  dimensions.  The  3A 3 framework  can  also  be  used  operationally  as  a  tool  to  navigate  the  different  options  and opportunities  for  participation  [51].

When  understanding  how  digital  participation  is  shaped  and  developed,  the  framework  can  be  used  as  an  analytical  tool  to  analyze  similarities  and  differences,  which  this study  aspires  for.  The  framework  was  derived  from  urban  planning  studies,  which  fits well  with  the  digital  participation  initiative  that  we  intend  to  analyse;  both  have  strong focus  on  planning  and  designing  the  urban  space.  Through  the  framework  I  study  the implications  of  actors,  arenas  and  aims  in  shaping  digital  citizen  participation.

## 3.3 Data  Collection

In  this  theoretically  informed  case  study  [52],  I  draw  on  the  theoretical  concept  developed  by  Hofer  &amp;  Kaufmann  [51].  This  builds  upon  existing  theoretical  frameworks  of participation  which  we  consider  reliable  for  informing  our  research  question.  Theory  is integrated  into  the  case  study  research  to  establish  connections  between  the  findings  and relevant  theoretical  frameworks  and  research  [52,  53].  Case  1  -  Citizen  Dialogue  and Case  2  -  Comprehensive  Plan,  both  aim  to  engage  citizens  to  participate  in  developing their  community.  The  cases  were  selected  because  they  occur  in  the  same  institutional setting,  a  Swedish  municipality  (the  surrounding  context  in  the  framework),  and  target  the same  community.  However,  they  differ  in  how  participation  is  implemented.  Therefore, I  wanted  to  explore  these  cases  more  deeply  to  understand  how  the  differences  manifest.  Numerous  municipalities  implement  digital  participation  in  a  comparable  manner, consequently,  valuable  lessons  can be drawn  from  this study with regard to  broader application.

From  January-June  2023  I  have  collected  archival  data,  performed  interviews  and been  involved  on  the  field  doing  observations,  attending  meetings  and  events  (table  1).

Interviews  were  conducted  online  and  in  physical  meetings,  interviews  were  recorded with  consent,  translated  from  Swedish  to  English,  and  transcribed  for  analysis  (Table  2).

## 3.4 Data  Analysis

In  the  analysis,  I  used  the  3A 3 -framework  of  participation  [51]  and  its  dimensions  and  elements  analysing  how  these  are  reflected  in  the  data.  Multiple  data  sources  were  used;  the digital  participation  platforms,  archival  documents,  observations,  reports,  pre-studies, public  communication  related  to  the  projects,  notes  from  project  meetings  and  interviews  with  key  roles  (see  Table  1).  Moving  back  and  forth  between  the  case  data  and  the conceptual  framework,  using  an  abductive  process  [54]  whereby  coded  for  the  framework  dimensions  while'  staying  open'  for  discovering  new  dimensions.  This  iterative process  allowed  identifying  patterns  and  discovering  the  similarities  and  differences.

The  initial  step  in  the  analysis  was  to  identify  and  comprehend  arenas,  aims  and  actors in  each  case,  followed  by  the  analysis  of  its  constituent  elements.  This  was  achieved  by

employing  a  tabular  representation,  wherein  the  elements  were  systematically  mapped and  then  compared.  This  facilitated  the  identification  of  both  commonalities  and  divergences.  Thereafter,  the  focus  shifted  to  a  more  in-depth  exploration  of  these  divergences in  the  two  cases.  The  next  phase  involved  a  more  detailed  examination  of  the  data  in order  to  analyse  the  components  related  to  the  elements  that  could  clarify  and  advance the  understanding  of  how  the  divergences  manifested  themselves  in  the  cases.

## 4 Findings

Study  of  Arenas:  Both  conducted  open  meetings  with  citizens  as  well  as  with  targeted groups.  These  meetings  were  carried  out  in  a  similar  manner,  regarding  the  spaces  used, the  frequency  of  meetings,  and  their  rhythm.  What  emerged  as  a  significant  difference were  the  digital  platforms  and  formats  used,  prompting  us  to  analyze  this  aspect  more thoroughly.

Analysis  of  Actors:  We  found  that  both  recruitment  and  subjects  were  similar;  they were staffed by and targeted similar groups. However,  we  found  that the proposals and  information  gathered  from  the  citizens  were  handled  using  different  approaches.  A difference  we  found  was  linked  to  the  roles  of  the  civil  servants  and  how  they  performed in  processing  and  editing  the  input.

Emphasis  on  Aims:  The  data  revealed  a  strong  emphasis  on  the  dimension  of  aims. It  became  evident  that  all  three  elements;  issues,  rationales,  and  outcomes  significantly influence  the  shape  and  differentiation.  We  highlight  this  importance  in  our  analysis  and create  an  understanding  of  its  impact  (Fig.  2).

## 4.1 Rationale + Format:  Open  vs  Guiding

There is a clear distinction regarding the rationale for citizen participation. In  Case 1  -  Citizen  Dialogue,  citizen  participation  can  be  regarded  as  an  end  in  itself,  whereas in  Case 2 - Comprehensive  Plan,  citizen  participation  serves  as  a  means  to  create  a

comprehensive  plan  regulated  by  law  [50],  and  from  the  steering  document  one  can read  that  it  is  '…  a  sub-project  within  the  framework  of  the  comprehensive  plan  and will  deliver  results  to  the  process'.  Case  1  -  Citizen  Dialogue  on  the  other  hand,  can be  described  as  a  dialogue  for  the  sake  of  a  dialogue.  The  municipality  perceives  it  as beneficial  to  engage  in  such  discourse  and  to  demonstrate  a  willingness  to  listen  and consider  the  opinions  of  its  citizens.  This  is  reflected  in  their  policy  document  which states: 'It is important to incorporate residents' experience and knowledge  of local conditions  into  decision-making  and  implementation'.  Case 2 - Comprehensive  Plan  is a  component  of  a  larger  process  where  citizens'  opinions  are  collected  in  to  serve  as  one of  several  supporting  elements  in  the  formulation  of  a  comprehensive  plan.  Participation thus  has  a  discernible  objective  and  is  not  an  end  in  itself.

In  Case  1  -  Citizen  Dialogue,  participation  as  an  end  implies  an  openness  for  participants  to  contribute  freely  based  on  their  ideas  and  thoughts.  This  is  reflected  in  the platform's  call  to  action:  'Y ou  can  help  change  your  neighborhood'.  However,  this  openness  also  creates  ambiguity,  that  can  make  it  challenging  for  participants  to  focus  their opinions  or  understand  the  specific  areas  where  input  is  most  valuable.  Consequently, which  is  visible  in  the  reports,  many  of  the  comments  received  are  not  relevant  or  related to  the  municipality's  services  or  areas  of  concern.  This  is  manifested  in  the  platform  as a  simple  form  where  the  user  can  post  whatever  proposal  they  want.  The  starting  point is  a  blank  sheet  without  any  direction  for  the  user.  Few  citizens  use  the  platform  to  post suggestions,  the  usage  statistics  shows  that  the  uptake  is  minimal.  Moreover,  there  is no  particular  reason  to  express  an  opinion  and  no  sense  of  urgency.  This  means  that everyone  can  participate  but  also  (perhaps)  that  no  one  is  necessarily  interested  because there  is  no  issue  that  attracts  attention.

The  fact  that  participation  itself  can  be  said  to  be  the  goal,  makes  it  complicated  to link  what  is  collected  to  something  that  can  be  acted  upon.  The  absence  of  a  defined problem  and  the  focus  on  citizen  expression  complicate  the  establishment  of  a  cohesive link  between  these  diverse  perspectives  and  the  objectives  of  administrations.  It  is  diffuse  how  and  where  the  proposals  should  be  addressed,  who  should  be  responsible  for implementing  them  and  how  it  should  be  done.  There  is  no  clear  timeline  and  for  those involved  it  is  unclear  if  or  when  anything  will  be  acted  upon.  This  is  reinforced  by  the  fact that  those  who  work  with  Case  1  -  Citizen  Dialogue  belong  to  the  central  administration and  that  the  integration  into  the  organisation  is  weak.  Several  civil  servants  involved  in collecting  proposals  mention  that  it  is  challenging  to  find  someone  to  drive  and  realise the  ideas  that  are  submitted.

Case  2  -  Comprehensive  Plan  has  a  clearer  intention  and  purpose  that  can  create motivation  to participate. You  can  only participate right now;  this is your chance  to influence  the  comprehensive  plan,  expressed  in  marketing  as:  'your  thoughts  and  ideas are  important  and  can  contribute  to  the  municipality's  new  comprehensive  plan'.  There is  a  defined  and  limited  purpose  and  a  sense  of  urgency  that  can  attract  and  motivate citizens. This is also reflected in the configuration of the platform, where  there are questions  and  a  definition  of  what  type  of  contribution  that  is  asked  for,  thus  enabling the  creation  of  a  comprehensive  plan.  The  platform  has  an  interactive  map  and  a  set of  themes  and  questions  that  guides  the  user,  creating  clarity  and  simplicity.  This  is  a

deliberate  intention  and  in  project  meetings  there  was  a  consensus  that  questions  should not  be  'to  open'  and  contributions  should  consultative  (Fig.  3).

## 4.2 Issues + Roles:  Degree  of  Interpretation  as  Governing

In  both  cases,  the  civil  servants  involved  are  a  relatively  small  number  of  employees belonging  to  the  central  administration.  There  is  a  main  project  manager  for  each  of  the initiatives  who  organizes  the  work,  liaises  with  the  supplier,  compiles  the  results  and reports  them  to  the  politicians.  The  analysis  of  the  data  reveals  that  the  way  in  which the  expertise  of  the  civil  servants  is  expressed  and  utilized,  which  may  appear  similar at  first  glance,  differ  significantly.  In  Case 1 - Citizen  Dialogue,  the  role  of  the  project manager  is  the  development  of  democratic  processes,  facilitate  participation,  and  possess  the  knowledge  required  to  make  appropriate  recommendations  aligned  with  the municipality's  decision-making  mandate.  Once  a  proposal  has  been  received,  it  will  not be  distorted  or  interpreted  by  the  project  manager  or  the  politicians;  rather,  a  proposal is  preserved  in  its  original  form.  The  civil  servant  in  charge  of  the  process  present  the proposals  to  the  politicians  together  with  a  recommendation,  they  then  determine  which proposals  that  should  be  implemented  and  financed.  These  reports  from  the  citizen  dialogues  are  simply  lists  of  proposals  in  its  originated  form.  Not  interpreting  the  proposals at  all  can  have  consequences,  the  project  manager  remember  situations  where  'it  has happened  that  a  citizen  makes  a  suggestion,  I  have  investigated  it  (..)  and  came  to  the conclusion  that  this  is  the  closest  we  can  do,  (…)  then  the  politicians  say  it's  a  good proposal,  but  it's  not  close  enough  to  what  the  citizens  want'.  As  opposed  to  undertaking an  action  that  might  be  tantamount  to  the  desired  outcome,  no  action  will  be  taken.

In  Case  2  -  Comprehensive  Plan,  the  proposals  received  serve  as  a  foundation  for the  urban  planners  to  further  analyse  and  interpret.  They  may  consolidate  similar  proposals,  identify  patterns  in  the  material,  and  develop  principles  and  directions  for  the comprehensive  plan  based  on  the  proposals  submitted.  This  process  involves  utilizing the  expertise  of  the  urban  planners  and  integrating  their  ideas  with  those  of  politicians to  facilitate  a  decision  on  a  new  comprehensive  plan.  The  input  provided  by  citizens represents  one  element  of  the  process,  but  there  are  other  factors  considered.  The  project

manager  means  that  'it  becomes  an  analysis  grid  on  that,  you  pick  out  certain  things and  where  you  analyse  in  a  certain  way  and  compile  in  a  certain  way.  It's  always  very difficult  because  everything  is  possible'.

Politicians  are  involved  in  both  processes,  in  the  dialogue  initiative  they  make  decisions  about  funding  from  a  shortlist  of  proposals  recommended  by  the  project  manager. In  Case  2  -  Comprehensive  Plan  the  politicians  will  eventually  decide  upon  a  comprehensive  plan  for  10-15  years  ahead  where  the  participation  from  citizens  serves  as one  input  among  others.  Urban  planners  do  their  interpretation  of  the  material,  and  they process  it  before  it  becomes  a  document  presented  to  the  politicians.  There  are  several levels  of  interpretations,  and  the  urban  planners  are  expected  to  use  their  expertise  to produce  this  document.  In  Case  1  -  Citizen  Dialogue,  the  level  of  interpretation  is  almost none,  the  proposals  are  evaluated  and  decided  upon  as  they  were  written  by  the  citizens.

## 4.3 Format + Outcome:  The  Intertwining  of  Temporality  and  Tangibility

The  two  cases  demonstrate  differences  in  the  implementation  of  the  platforms,  their appearance  and  the  manner  of  interaction  with  citizens.  Case  1  -  Citizen  Dialogue  is participation  with  the  ambition  to  give  citizens  the  opportunity  to  influence  their  local area.  There  is  a  budget,  and  feasible  proposals  can  be  financed  by  the  municipality.  There is  a  willingness  to  listen,  and  the  dialogue  has  an  ambition  to  strengthen  the  image  of the  municipality  and  the  mutual  trust  between  citizens  and  the  municipality.

The  two  cases  differ  in  their  time  horizons.  Case  2  -  Comprehensive  Plan  involves a  focused  effort  to  gather  citizens'  opinions  and  thoughts  on  what  their  neighborhood should  look  like  in  the  future,  the  project  manager  says:  'we  hope  to  discuss  (…)  longterm  development  together  with  our  citizens.  That  is,  how  they  see  the  future  and  the physical  environment  now  and  20  years  ahead'.  It  aspires  to  be  visionary  and  longterm,  in  a  dialogue  that  takes  place  right  now.  Case  1  -  Citizen  Dialogue  is  short-term, focusing  on  the  immediate  desires  of  citizens,  examples  of  proposals  from  the  aggregated list  include:  better  food  in  school,  open  air  cinema  and  seating  for  elderly.

The  discrepancy  between  these  temporalities  means  divergent  outcomes;  Case  1  Citizen  Dialogue  shows  tangible  results  in  proposals  that  are  decided  on,  given  a  budget and  implemented.  There  is  also  an  idea  of  active  citizens,  strengthened  trust  and  relationship  building.  In  the  context  of  the  comprehensive  plan,  the  result  is  intangible,  a plan  is  to  be  formulated  and  the  input  from  citizens,  after  interpreted  by  urban  planners, becomes  an  integral  part of that plan. The  process  is  visualised  and  how  their  opinions  will  be  treated  and  what  the  final  product  will  be  handled,  something  that  creates trust  [55].  There  is  a  timeline,  and  it  will  be  possible  to  follow  the  political  process  and decisions  that  will  be  taken  in  the  future.  It  is  hoped  that  this  is  something  that  can  be realised  in  the  long  term  and  aligned  into  the  municipality's  infrastructure  and  environment.  Once  the  new  comprehensive  plan  is  developed  and  adopted,  it  will  be  accessible and  presented  to  citizens.  Case  2  -  Comprehensive  Plan  has  yielded  a  tangible  outcome in  the  form  of  a  proposal  for  a  comprehensive  plan.  However,  the  absence  of  a  concrete result  until  the  development  of  the  comprehensive  plan  can  also  be  argued.

## 5 Discussion

Using  the  3A 3 framework  [51]  the  analysis  highlights  how  two  participation  initiatives diverge  and  how  their  differences  manifest.  A  considerable  body  of  research  has  been dedicated  to  investigating  the  levels  of  impact  and  the  factors  that  determine  participation. This  has  highlighted  challenges  related  to  representativeness  and  inequality  [24,  33,  38, 40].  This  study  takes  the  organisational  perspective  and  from  prior  research  we  know that  public  sector  organisations  have  a  focus  on  achieving  efficiency  rather  than  being innovative,  and  the  adaptation  and  ability  to  change  is  limited  [56].  Scholars  have  argued that  embeddedness  and  integration  in  governance  as  a  way  to  foster  participation  [14, 24,  57].

The  present  study  indicates  challenges  connected  to  adaptation  and  change  when proposals  are  received  that  cannot  be  addressed,  nor  implemented.  Case  1  -  Citizen  Dialogue  is  open  and  unstructured,  a  form  of  participation  facing  obstacles  in  the  bureaucratic  and  non-adaptive  organisation  such  as  a  municipality.  The  comprehensive  plan  on the  contrary,  has  a  clear  process  where  participation  is  guided  and  outcomes  are  managed  in  a  predetermined  manner.  The  structure  aligns  with  the  municipality's  established governance  and  can  be  regarded  as  optimisation  of  participation  (Fig.  4).

## 5.1 Digital  Participation  as  Optimisation

Our  analysis  of  the  differences  and  how  they  manifest  leads  us  to  interpret  Case 2 - Comprehensive  Plan  as  optimisation  of  participation.  In  this  form  of  participation,  citizens are  involved  with  the  aim  of  contributing  to  the  development  of  the  existing  structure in  a  clear  and  well-defined  process.  In  the  platform,  the  user  is  prompted  to  respond  to leading  questions,  generating  the  necessary  information  for  the  process.  The  user  cannot deviate  or  submit  alternative  ideas  What  is  collected  undergoes  an  analysis  and  interpretations  are  made  of  the  compiled  contribution  from  the  participants.  Civil  servants  write a  report  that  is  proposed  to  the  politicians  and  according  to  a  pre-agreed  process,  which is  eventually  approved  in  accordance  with  laws  and  regulations.

Participation  as  optimisation  is  a  form  of  participation  that  the  organisation  is  well positioned  to  implement.  It  is  consistent  with  the  governance  and  structure  that  admits well-defined,  smaller  developments.  This  does  not  pressure  the  organisation  to  be  transparent  or  responsive,  other  than  the  process  that  has  already  been  established.  The  participation  platform  had  a  substantial  uptake  of  citizens  contributing  to  the  comprehensive plan.  The  organisation's  ability  to  manage,  control  and  direct  participation  as  optimisation  ensures  its  potential  in  achieving  the  desired  level  of  participation,  contribution  and results.

## 5.2 Innovative  and  Creative  Digital  Participation

Case  1  -  Citizen  Dialogue  is  built  on  an  assumption  that  citizens  want  to  participate in  the  democratic  life  and  that  they  understand  and  see  this  as  their  responsibility.  The platform  does  not  tell  the  user  what  to  submit,  it  is  open  for  any  ideas  and  opinions. The  proposals  received  are  not  distorted,  in  fact  they are  not  in  any  way  interpreted, merely  put  forward  the  way  they  were  written.  Ideas  can  be  bold,  crazy  and  completely misaligned.  The  interaction  needed  to  advance  new  ideas  does  not  take  place  [58],  thus most  proposals  become  shelf  warmers.  The  lack  of  feedback  and  capability  of  turning new  ideas  into  reality  makes  the  citizens  (and  the  civil  servants)  call  it  a  'participation game'  -  participation  that  does  not  have  the  ability  to  create  impact  [59].  Of  course, this  is  no  surprise  that  one  of  the  most  prominent  challenges  governments  face  is  to adapt  and  change,  be  more  innovative  and  creative.  This  explains  the  challenges  that many  organisations'  experiences  when,  with  their  best  intentions,  they  try  to  open  up  for participation,  but  since  this  is  actually  about  exploration  the  organisation  does  not  have the  capabilities  to  facilitate  this  approach.

The  inherent  conflict  is  whether  participation  needs  to  be  guided  and  limited  to  be considered  effective  and  beneficial.  Our  results  indicate  that  participation  is  more  likely to  succeed  when  there  is  a  clear  expectation  of  the  input  needed,  combined  with  guiding questions  and  explicit  instructions  on  how  to  participate.  What  might  be  perceived  as open  and  creative,  the  possibility  to  participate  on  one's  own  terms  and  offer  any  opinion and  suggestion  can  instead  become  obstructive.  The  lack  of  clarity  makes  it  difficult achieve  meaningful  results  and  the  absence  of  feedback  fosters  distrust.

## 5.3 Implications  for  Practice  and  Research

Historically,  Swedish  municipalities  have  engaged  in  initiatives  that  encourage  citizen participation  [33],  characterized  by  an  almost  naive  view  that  all  participation  is  inherently  positive.  There  has  been  a  focus  on  the  potential  benefits,  overshadowing  the  risks of  eroding  trust  that  can  occur  when  citizen  participation  fails  to  produce  tangible  results [2].

This  research  shows  that  there  is  a  need  to  clarify  and  be  able  to  distinguish  different types  of  participation  that  the  municipalities  deploy.  We  have  shown  that  participation, despite  being  characterized  as  open  to  new  ideas,  does  not  have  the  prerequisites  to  create change.  This  is  because  innovative  modus  operandi  is  difficult  and  not  yet  accomplished, although  called  for  [60].  Conversely,  participation  that  is  integrated  into  well-defined projects are better equipped  to  succeed  as  municipalities  know  how  to  manage  and

implement  optimisation.  This  study  has  expanded  our  understanding  and  definition  of participation,  introducing  a  connection  to  optimisation  and  innovation.  Using  Hofer's 3m 3 as  an  analytical  tool  [51]  has  demonstrated  differences  in  participation  and  how they  manifest.

The  question remains  for municipalities whether  they should continue to  implement  what  they  have  mastered,  namely  optimisation;  clear  processes  that  guide  citizens. This  participation  is  characterised  by  its  ability  to  deliver  on  its  promises.  However,  it does  not  demonstrate  any  intention  to  influence  or  innovate.  Do  municipalities  need  to change  in  order  to  genuinely  harness  the  ideas,  and  potentially  the  skills,  of  their  citizens?  The  creation  of  citizen-centred  innovation  may  be  a  prerequisite  for  enhancing  the trust  between  citizens  and  municipalities.  The  present  study  does  not  seek  to  provide  a definitive  answer  to  these  questions;  rather,  it  identifies  an  area  for  future  research.

Numerous  municipalities  are  implementing  digital  participation in  a  comparable way, and therefore valuable lessons can be learnt from  this study in terms of  wider application.  This  does  not  mean  that  this  study  is  without  limitations.  The  use  of  the  3A 3 framework  [51]  provided  an  analytical  tool  with  a  strong  focus  on  arenas,  aims  and  actors and  the  ability  to  analyse  and  understand  differences  based  on  these.  However,  using  an inductive  approach  might  provide  a  richer  and  more  nuanced  picture  of  differences  as no  boundaries  are  set.

Abstract. With  their  broad  service  portfolio,  strict  regulations,  and  often  scarce resources,  municipalities  face  specific  requirements  and  challenges  for  mastering  digital  transformation.  While  maturity  assessments  have  become  a  common means  of  improving  project  management  at  the  organizational  level,  there  is  no domain-specific  approach  yet  that  focuses  on  digital  project  management  in  municipalities.  This  article  reports  on  the  development  and  evaluation  of  ECoProMD,  an Easy  Communal  Project  Maturity  model  for  Digitalization.  Based  on  an  extended understanding  of  maturity  models  as  a  combination  of  model  and  method,  we  used situational  method  engineering  to  design  and  validate  the  ECoProMD  artifact.  A literature  review  and  19  interviews  with  seven  municipal  experts  from  Germany provided  the  knowledge  base  for  this  research.

## 1 Introduction

<!-- image -->

Effective  project  management  (PM)  is  a  key  enabler  of  digital  transformation  in  public  administration,  ensuring  that  technology-driven  initiatives  are  successfully  implemented,  aligned  with  strategic  goals,  and  deliver  tangible  improvements  in  public  service delivery  [1].  In  the  public  sector,  digital  projects  often  involve  complex  stakeholder  environments,  regulatory  constraints,  and  long-term  impacts  on  administrative  structures  [2]. Without  mature  PM,  municipalities,  like  other  organizations,  risk  project  delays,  budget overruns,  and  failures  that  undermine  public  trust  and  digital  government  objectives  [3, 4].

Digital  PM  has  evolved  to  address  these  challenges  within  the  ongoing  digital  transformation  in  business,  public  service,  and  society.  It  can  be  defined  as  the  'combination of  traditional  project  management  and  the  full  adoption  of  digital  tools  and  technologies  in  the  management  of  projects'  [5].  Its  main  benefit,  compared  to  the  traditional

approach,  is  an  improved  ability  to  manage  project-related  information,  which  enables increased  effectiveness  and  efficiency  in  project  planning,  execution,  and  control  [5,  6] While  digital  PM  can  be  seen  as  an  adaptation  of  PM  to  the  challenges  and  requirements of  digital  transformation,  it  is  also  often  (but  not  only)  applied  for  managing  digitalization projects  [5].

Maturity  assessment  [7]  is  a  well-established  strategy  to  evaluate  an  organization's PM  capability  effectiveness  and  efficiency,  benchmark  it  with  other  organizations,  and improve  it  systematically  [8-10].  Despite  the  many  existing  PM  maturity  models  (PM3), there  is  no  domain-specific  model  yet  that  focuses  on  the  particular  requirements  and challenges  of  municipalities  for  mastering  digital  transformation  [11].  To  close  this  gap, our  research  is  guided  by  the  question:

RQ:  How  can  municipalities  determine  the  maturity  level  of  their  digital  project management capability, improve it, and consolidate it?

Based  on  this  question,  our  objective  is  to  design  a  tailored  maturity  model  for  digital PM  of  municipalities  as  the  smallest  units  of  local  government  (usually  a  city,  town,  or village). The  purpose  of  the  new  PM  maturity  model  is  to  support  municipalities  in advancing  their capability to deliver successful digitalization projects. For  increased utility and practical impact  of our research, we  focus  both on the model  and  on  the method  character  of  maturity  assessment  [12].  Consequently,  we  designed  an  artifact that  integrates  a  maturity  model  and  a  method  for  using  the  model  to  manage  maturity. As  a  result,  this  paper  presents  the  ECoProMD  model  and  method,  an  Easy  Communal Project  Maturity  model  for  Digitalization.

## 2 Theoretical Background and Related Work

The  purpose  of  maturity  models  is  to  identify  strengths  and  weaknesses  in  certain  areas of  organizations.  The  concept  has  its  origins  in  quality  management,  aiming  to  establish continuous  improvement  processes  and  optimize  product  quality.  In  1979,  Crosby  [13] described  a  concept  of  successive  maturity  levels  that  provides  a  simple  but  effective analysis  and  measurement  tool.  Maturity  models  became  more  widely  known  in  software  engineering  with  the  introduction  of  the  Capability  Maturity  Model  (CMM),  later extended  to  CMMI  (CMM  Integration)  [14].  Since  then,  the  basic  concept  has  been expanded  and  transferred  to  other  disciplines  (e.g.,  business  process  management)  and is  also  used  for  PM.  Cooke-Davies  [15]  reported  over  30  specialized  maturity  models for  PM  existing  in  2001.

Facing  the  many  proposed  models,  several  comparative  studies  have  been  published over  the  years  that  examine  and  evaluate  selected  models  (e.g.,  [9,  16,  17]).  Frameworks for  PM  maturity  model  (PM3)  comparison  with  multi-criteria  evaluation  were  proposed by  Man  [18]  as  well  as  Domingues  and  Ribeiro  [19].  Other  practice-oriented  studies explore  the  adoption  and  application  of  PM3s  (e.g.,  [20-22]).

With  a  more  fundamental  view,  Mettler  [12]  discusses  maturity  model  development and  application  based  on  a  design  science  research  (DSR)  perspective.  He  conceptualizes maturity  models  as  hybrid  artifacts  being  'somehow  in-between'  a  model  (state  descriptions,  i.e.,  the  maturity  levels)  and  a  method  (key  practices)  prescribing  the  systematic

use  of  the  model.  The  DSR  perspective  is  also  adopted  by  other  studies  investigating the  procedure  and  principles  of  designing  domain-specific  maturity  models  (e.g.,  [2325]). In their recent article, Stoiber et al.  [26]  draw  on  Mettler  [12]  and  the  method character  of  maturity  models  to  advocate  for  continuous  maturity  assessments,  which they  found  not  supported  by  many  existing  models.  To  extend  and  advance  traditional principles  of  maturity  assessment,  they  propose  the  Continuous  Maturity  Assessment Method  (CMAM)  [26].

Only  a  few  studies  shed  light  on  PM  maturity  in  public  administration.  Irfan  et  al. [3] investigated maturity of PM  as an  antecedent to organizational reputation based on  a  sample  of  425  respondents  from  the  project-based  public  sector  organizations  of Pakistan.  The  reported  findings  indicate  a  significant  positive  relationship  between  PM maturity  and  the  reputation  of  public  sector  organizations.  Bezerra  et  al.  [27]  conducted a  systematic  literature  review  to  identify  barriers  to  maturity  in  PM  in  the  public  sector. Of  the  seven  presented  barrier  dimensions,  'management  methodology',  'human  relations',  'organizational  structure',  and  'alignment  with  the  organization's  business'  are directly  related  to  PM.  Consequently,  the  authors  emphasized  the  need  for  benchmarking  practices  in  the  PM  context  and  the  integration  with  strategic  management.  A  recent literature  study  on  existing  PM3s  in  public  administration  by  De  Rosa  [11]  found  that although  some  of  the  identified  models  basically  could  be  applied  to  public  administration,  'substantial  modifications  are  necessary  to  make  them  operational  and  effective in  the  public  sector'.  Furthermore,  the  maturity  models  discussed  do  not  consider  any specific  characteristics  of  digitalization  projects  in  public  administration.

As  a  result,  it  can  be  stated  that  many  of  the  existing  maturity  models  fail  to  provide  a simple  but  sound  model  with  low-threshold  access  for  local  authorities  of  different  sizes due  to their complexity  (e.g.,  extensive  catalogs  of criteria and  capabilities).  Central success  factors  and  best  practices  in  the  project  environment  of  public  administration are  also  not  incorporated  to  the  necessary  extent.  In  the  following,  our  development  focus will  therefore  be  on  reducing  complexity  and  adding  specific  success  factors  concerning the  public  administration  domain  as  well  as  providing  clear  guidance  on  how  to  use  the model.

## 3 Research Design and Methods

Given  our  research's  objective,  we  decided  on  a  DSR  approach  [28,  29]  considering the  recommendations  of  previous  studies  on  developing  maturity  assessment  models [23-25,  30].  In  line  with  Mettler  [12],  we  understand  the  design  artifact  maturity  model as  a  combination  of  a  model  and  a  method  prescribing  the  systematic  use  of  the  model. Consequently,  we  draw  on  the  method  engineering  methodology  as  a  guiding  process within  our  DSR  approach  to  construct  and  validate  the  artifact.

## 3.1 Situational Method Engineering

Method  engineering  is  used  in  IS  [31]  as  'the  engineering  discipline  to  design,  construct and  adapt  methods,  techniques  and  tools  for  the  development  of  information  systems' [32].  Based  on  the  design  principle  of  reuse  [33],  the  assembly  of  situational  methods  for

specific  engineering  contexts  by  selecting,  adapting,  and  synthesizing  method  fragments from  existing  method  knowledge  has  become  an  established  practice  under  the  name of  situational  method  engineering  (SME)  [34-37].  SME  incorporates  an  iterative  and incremental  design  process  that  emphasizes  the  evaluation  of  method  modifications  to validate  fitness  for  use  and  value  outcome.

Maturity  assessment  and  improvement  for  digital  PM  in  municipalities  is  a  concrete engineering  scenario  that  requires  situational  customization  of  a  more  general  standard method.  Consequently,  we  aim  to  engineer  a  situational  method  for  the  given  scenario that  integrates  a  conceptual  maturity  model  as  tool  [38]  for  providing  practical  guidance for  assessing  and  improving  the  maturity  level  of  digital  project  management  in  municipalities.  Furthermore,  we  aim  to  contribute  to  the  method  base  of  maturity  models  in support  of  further  developments  of  other  situational  maturity  methods.

The  first  step  of  our  engineering  process,  illustrated  in  Fig.  1,  comprises  characterizing  the  situation  by  accumulating  domain  knowledge  on  digital  project  management  in municipalities.  A  situation  is  'characterised  by  a  number  of  factors  that  influence  or  are being  influenced  by  a  method  fragment'  [35].  Method  fragments  are  the  building  blocks of  situational  methods,  defined  as  'coherent  pieces  of  IS  development  methods'  [32]. The  fragments  can  be  either  process-focused  or  product-focused,  and  both  subtypes  can be  combined  to  form  composite  method  chunks  [35].  The  initial  knowledge  about  the situation  was  acquired  by  conducting  both  a  literature  review  and  expert  interviews.

## 3.2 Literature Review and Interviews

To  gain  a  profound  understanding  of  the  situation,  we  performed  a  narrative  literature review  [39]  with  a  mixed  scope  on  research  outcomes,  methods,  and  practices  or  applications  following  an  iterative  process.  For  the  initial  search  we  used  the  literature  databases Google  Scholar,  Semantic  Scholar,  Bielefeld  Academic  Search  Engine  (BASE),  and  the Open  Research  Knowledge  Graph  (ORKG)  with  the  search  term  '('project  management'  AND  'maturity')  AND  ('municipal'  OR  'local  government'  OR  'public')'.  We

selected  relevant  papers  by  screening  title  and  abstract  and  continued  with  backward and  forward  searches.  From  the  review  results,  we  collected  influencing  or  influenced factors  like  stakeholders,  actor  roles,  organizational  structures,  practices  and  processes, application  systems,  challenges,  and  success  factors  [40].

Expert  interviews  were  another  method  we  used  to  collect  empirical  data  for  accumulating  knowledge  about  the  domain.  For  the  interviews,  we  selected  seven  people from  different  organizations  because  of  their  domain-specific  knowledge  displayed  by their  organizational  role.  Of  the  seven  people,  six  work  for  municipal  organizations  and one  for  a  state  administration,  where  the  person  coordinates  projects  with  municipal partners.  Table  1  gives  an  overview  of  the  interviewees  with  their  characteristics.

All  interviews  were  conducted  as  semi-structured  conversations  based  on  a  standardized  guideline.  After  a  short  introduction  and  some  person-related  questions,  we  asked for  the  state  of  PM,  best  practices  in  the  organization,  and  success  factors,  followed  by questions  on  requirements  for  a  PM3  and  further  issues  from  the  interviewee's  view, before  closing  with  a  request  for  feedback.  The  recordings  or  protocols  were  transcribed and  went  through  a  qualitative  content  analysis  following  [41]  using  the  software  tool MAXQDA. During our research  process,  we  performed  a  series  of  three  interview  rounds from  June  to  October  2024,  starting  with  requirements-focused  interviews  and  ending with  two  rounds  of  evaluative  interviews.  In  the  third  round,  two  interviewees  were  not available,  resulting  in  a  total  of  19  interviews.  The  interview  duration  was  in  the  first and  second  round  between  60  min  and  1h  50  min,  in  the  third  round  50  min  on  average.

## 3.3 Iterative Engineering Process

After  characterizing  the  situation,  the  process  continues  with  iterative  engineering  steps. The knowledge base provides requirements that are used for selecting appropriate method  fragments  from  the  method  base  guided  by  the  individual  design  goal  and  design principles  [25,  42].  Because  of  our  focus  on  high  usability  for  practice,  our  method  base was created from both international best practice standards  for  project  management maturity  assessment  and  published  maturity  models  from  academic  literature.  Of  the many  existing  best  practice  models,  we  selected  the  Capability  Maturity  Model  Integration  (CMMI)  as  the  'mother'  of  all  capability  maturity  models  [14]  and  three  project management  focused  models  with  relevance  for  public  administration  according  to  the expert  interviews  (see  Table  2).

Table 2. Selected  maturity  models  forming  the  method  base.

(ISACA: Information Systems Audit and Control Association, IPMA: International Project Management  Association,  PMI:  Project  Management  Institute).

The  next  step  is  selecting  method  fragments  from  the  method  base  that  meet  the specific  requirements  of  municipal  project  management  according  to  the  knowledge base  for  inclusion  into  the  new  situational  method  (e.g.,  compliance  with  regulations and  laws,  transparency,  and  budget  control).  Also,  more  general  quality  criteria  (e.g., reliability,  applicability,  user-friendliness)  emphasized  by  the  municipal  experts  were considered.  Other  options for the design decision are the exclusion  of  inappropriate fragments  or  the  adaptation  of  fragments  in  the  next  step.

For  the  evaluation  of  the  assembled  method,  we  conducted  two  rounds  of  semistructured  interviews  asking  the  seven  experts  for  detailed  feedback  on  the  method's strengths and weaknesses.  This feedback  was  used for further improvements  of  the method  in  the  following  iteration.

## 4 Specific Requirements of Municipalities

When  developing  the  maturity  model,  the  specific  requirements  of  the  target  group  had to  be  considered  to  ensure  its  practical  applicability  and  effectiveness.  The  following design  premises  emerged  from  the  results  of  the  literature  review  and  the  findings  of  the first  round  of  expert  interviews  regarding  the  specific  framework  conditions,  challenges, and  success  factors  for  digitalization  projects  in  public  administration.

- 1) Low-threshold access and flexibility. Municipalities  in  Germany  vary  greatly  in terms  of  size,  resources,  and  digital  maturity.  The  maturity  model  must  reflect  the  organizational  structures  and  processes  of  the  municipal  administration  and  accommodate the  diverse  starting  conditions  and  capabilities  [E5].  This  includes  clear,  understandable language  [E1],  simple  application  mechanisms,  and  a  flexible  evaluation  system.  The model  is  intended  to  enable  municipalities  with  scarce  resources  to  realistically  assess the  status  quo  of  their  PM  and  derive  concrete,  implementable  development  steps  without  the  need  for  extensive  prior  knowledge  or  specialized  external  support  [E3-6].  The maturity  levels,  criteria,  and  evaluation  scales  must  therefore  be  formulated  in  a  practical and  easily  accessible  manner  to  ensure  broad  application.
- 2) Time required and complexity. Time  is  a  crucial  factor  [E2].  The  time  required  by organizations  to  apply  the  maturity  model  should  be  as  short  as  possible.  Conducting the  assessment  must  be  efficient  and  time  saving  [E6],  particularly  for  municipalities with  limited  human  resources.  This  requires  a  compact  structure,  clear  questions,  and a  clear  presentation  of  the  results  [E6].  The  model  should  be  'translated  as  practically as  possible  and  must  not  be  overly  complex'  (all  quotations  from  the  interviews  are translated  from  German  and  redacted)  [E4].  The  goal  is  for  municipalities  to  quickly assess  the  maturity  of  their  PM  and  derive  concrete  recommendations  for  action  without having  to  undergo  extensive  analysis  processes.
- 3) Focus on single project management. The  model  should  consider  the  specific  context of single digitalization projects. These projects are characterized  by  high  complexity,  technological  dynamics,  and  interdisciplinarity.  The  maturity  model  must  be able  to  reflect  these  factors  by  addressing  key  aspects  such  as  stakeholder,  change,  and risk  management,  as  well  as  digital  technologies  and  work  practices.  The  model  should place  strong  emphasis  on  operational  individual  PM,  as  this  enables  low-threshold  entry, especially  for  small  municipalities  [E3],  and  supports  the  successful  implementation  of projects.  The  model  must  therefore  provide  concrete  and  action-oriented  criteria  for  the evaluation  and  further  development  of  individual  projects.
- 4)  Suitability  for  self-assessment. It should  be possible for the parties involved  to collect the data for maturity assessment  independently,  i.e. without the  involvement of external third parties (e.g., consultants) [E3]. The  main  reasons  cited for this are expected  resource constraints (especially time and staff). For the  implementation  of self-assessments,  standardized  questionnaires  have  proven  their  worth  in  practice  [23]. This  requirement  correlates  with  the  low-threshold  access  and  the  time  required,  as  the maturity  assessment  can  be  conducted  on  this  basis  according  to  a  simple,  generally understandable  scheme,  eliminating  the  need  for  extensive  coordination  with  external stakeholders.
- 5) Consideration of organizational context. Since  PM  is  embedded  in  an  organizational  context  and  interfaces  exist  between  the  project  organization  and  the  line  organization,  the  model  must  also  take  into  account  corresponding  interactions  between  the projects  and  the  line  organization  in  the  evaluation  criteria  (e.g.,  organizational  framework  conditions  such  as  strategic  specifications  and  goals  of  the  line  organization  as well  as  interfaces)  [E1,  E3].

- 6) Tool support. The  applying  municipal  organizations  should  be  guided  through  maturity  assessment  according  to  a  concrete,  uniform  system.  Therefore,  maturity  level  measurement  and  assessment  should  be  supported  electronically  wherever  possible  [E7]. By  providing  a  digital  tool  (e.g.,  as  a  web-based  application),  a  fast,  automated,  and multi-layered  evaluation  (including  a  dashboard  view)  should  be  realized  [E1].
- 7)  Continuous  maturity  assessment. Finally, it must be ensured that the maturity model  not  only  allows  for  a  static  assessment  but  also  serves  as  a  tool  for  continuous improvement  [26].  The  model  should  therefore  be  designed  in  such  a  way  that  it  supports the development  of  digitalization projects over time and creates incentives for ongoing  optimization  [E2,  E3,  E6].  For  this  purpose,  basic  specifications  for  the  establishment  of  an  organizational  routine  (e.g.,  definition  of  responsibilities  and  specification of  evaluation  cycles)  must  be  made.

These  requirements  form  the  basis  for  the  development  of  the  maturity  model  and ensure  that  it  meets  the  specific  needs  of  municipal  administration  in  Germany  and  offers a  high  level  of  practical  benefit.

## 5 The ECoProMD Artifact

We  defined  four  maturity  levels  for  a  differentiated  view  of  PM  maturity  in  municipal authorities  and  institutions.  Five  dimensions  are  used  to  structure  PM  in  terms  of  content, which  are  assessed  based  on  specific  individual  criteria.  The  required  data  is  collected using  a  questionnaire-based  self-assessment.  A  five-point  Likert  scale  is  used  for  the evaluation. This section provides an  overview of the basic model  elements and the evaluation  system.

## 5.1 Model Perspective

The  ECoProMD  model  describes  the  maturity  of  PM  according  to  the  four  maturity levels  listed  in  Table  3.

Table 3. ECoProMD  maturity  levels.

| Maturity level   | Characteristics                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1) Initial       | • PM practices are informal, unstructured and ad-hoc. No standardized processes or methods exist • Project success depends heavily on individuals and their individual skills • There is little organizational support for PM • Projects have a limited focus on strategic goals |

| Maturity level   | Characteristics                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2) Defined       | • Fundamentally defined PM processes exist and initial approaches to standardizing terminology, methods and tools have been made • Project planning tasks such as target definition, resource planning and work breakdown structure are partially implemented • Basic structures and roles for PM have been established • PM knowledge is beginning to be anchored in parts of the organization |
| 3) Standardized  | • PM processes and methods are applied uniformly and as standard in projects throughout the organization • Clear structures, roles and responsibilities in PM exist • Processes for all PM phases (initiation, planning, implementation, controlling, and closure) are established • Projects are widely aligned with strategic objectives                                                      |
| 4) Governed      | • PM is firmly anchored in the organization and is developed proactively and continuously • PM methods are flexibly adapted to the respective project requirements • PM skills are developed throughout the organization • PM is an integral part of the organizational strategy                                                                                                                |

Maturity  level  2  (defined)  represents  the  baseline,  i.e.,  the  minimum  requirements for  professional  PM  are  met  when  this  level  is  reached.  It  should  at  least  be  achieved and  therefore  represents  the  minimum  target.  The  model  thus  provides  basic  orientation, particularly  for  municipalities  with  little  or  no  PM  experience,  and  removes  significant barriers  to  entry.  In  contrast,  maturity  level  3  (standardized)  represents  the  normal  target, i.e.,  when  this  level  is  reached,  the  organization  meets  all  the  basic  requirements  for professional  PM.  This  maturity  level  aims  to  provide  an  incentive  for  continuous  further development  beyond  the  minimum  level.

## PM Dimensions and Criteria

Based  on  the  analysis  of  existing  PM3s  and  taking  into  account  the  specific  requirements and  best  practices  from  the  expert  interviews,  the  five  PM  dimensions  with  according criteria  presented  in  Table  4  were  defined  for  the  ECoProMD  model.

## Data Collection and Evaluation

For  collecting  the  required  data  for  an  assessment,  a  questionnaire  was  designed,  which queries  all  ECoProMD  criteria  dimensions  and  also  considers  the  requirements  from the  expert  interviews.  The  questionnaire  is  divided  into  five  sections  according  to  the dimensions,  with  a  total  of  40  questions  covering  the  individual  criteria.

As  part  of  the  questionnaire-based  self-assessment,  the  degree  of  implementation within  the  organization  is  determined  for  each  criterion  by  the  respondents'  subjective assessment  using  a  five-point  Likert  scale:

0 - does not apply at all, 1 - applies to a small extent, 2 - partially applies, 3 - largely applies, 4 - fully applies.

Table 4. ECoProMD  dimensions  and  criteria.

| Dimension                    | Criteria                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1) Strategic alignment       | • Alignment of projects with organizational goals (interface to project portfolio management) • Development and alignment with a digitalization strategy • Prioritization of digitalization projects • Long-term resource and capacity planning • Benefit and value orientation of projects • Sustainable integration of project results • Continuous monitoring of the project environment • Continuous improvement of the organization's PM approach |

The  five-point  scale  allows  a  differentiated  assessment  by  the  respondents  and  is fully  transferable  in  terms  of  maturity  levels  by  means  of  scoring.  For  this  purpose,  each scale  entry  is  assigned  a  score  from  0  to  4  points  (does  not  apply  at  all = 0  points,  applies to  a  small  extent = 1  point,  etc.).

To  evaluate  the  questionnaire,  the  average  of  all  ratings  is  first  calculated  for  each dimension.  The  overall  average  is  then  calculated  from  the  mean  value  of  all  dimensions. The  maturity  level  is  determined  on  this  basis  using  the  following  range  of  points:

0-0.99 pts.: initial, 1-1.99 pts.: defined, 2-2.99 pts.: standardized, 3-4 pts.: governed.

Concerning  the  data  evaluation,  it  was  required  to  enable  a  differentiated  understanding  of  the  data  (per  dimension)  and  to  support  quick  and  easy  graphical  visualization. A  spider  web  diagram  is  suitable  for  this  purpose.  The  evaluation  results  can  thus  be viewed  in  direct  comparison.  However,  this  representation  does  not  allow  any  statement about  specific  weak  points  or  improvement  potentials.  A  detailed  evaluation  of  the  individual  criteria  is  therefore  also  necessary.  A  bullet  chart  is  suitable  for  obtaining  a  quick overview  of  the  status  of  all  individual  criteria  in  all  dimensions.  Thus,  the  maturity  levels achieved  for  each  individual  criterion  can  be  specifically  tracked  and  compared  with  the desired  target  state.  This  detailed  view  also  provides  clues  as  to  where  strengths  (individual  criterion  with  a  high  level  of  maturity)  and  potential  for  improvement  (individual criterion with  a low  level of maturity)  lie. In  addition,  detailed  analysis  also  enables the  transparent  presentation  of  progress  as  part  of  the  continuous  maturity  assessment. Based  on  the  respective  target  status  (e.g.,  normal  target  maturity  level  3),  the  degree of fulfillment  or progress  (ratio  of  achieved  point  value  to  target  point value)  can  be determined  and  displayed.

## 5.2 Method Perspective

Since  a  static  approach  neglects  the  continuous  development  of  competencies  and  the associated  evolutionary  progress  of  maturity  in  constantly  changing  organizations,  ECoProMD  aims  to  provide  recommendations  for  establishing  maturity  measurement  as  a continuous  organizational  routine  in  line  with  [26].  Two  factors  are  particularly  important  for  this:  the  definition  of  a  role  responsible  for  implementation  and  the  definition  of schedules  and  recurring  triggers  for  tracking  capabilities  [26].  Due  to  the  very  different starting  situations  in  the  individual  municipalities,  the  only  recommendation  made  at this  point  is  to  define  a  role  responsible  for  maturity  assessment.  For  the  ECoProMD model,  we  defined  a  five-step  evaluation  cycle,  which  is  illustrated  in  Fig.  2  together with  the  maturity  levels  and  dimensions.

For the initiation, certain decision parameters must be defined by the  organization. These  include  the requirements  of  the target organization  and  the definition of the  assessment  objective.  The  design  objectives  of  the  ECoProMD  model  provide  an initial  orientation.  In  the  second  step  (analyze  &amp;  assign),  the  current  maturity  level  is determined  using  the  questionnaire  provided.  The  result  provides  the  organization  with a  differentiated  overview  of  the  strengths  and  potential  for  improvement  for  each  dimension  or  individual  criterion.  Subsequently,  improvement  measures  can  be  defined  and prioritized  based  on  the  current  maturity  level  and  the  organization's  goals.  ECoProMD is  intended  to  provide  concrete  catalogs  of  measures  and  best  practices  for  this  in  the

future.  In  the  fourth  step,  the  defined  measures  are  implemented.  The  final  phase  checks the  outcome  and  impact  of  the  executed  measures.  It  also  ensures  that  the  maturity  model is  used  continuously  and  initiates  the  next  assessment  cycle.  Based  on  the  expert  statements,  a  cyclical  application  of  the  ECoProMD  model  within  a  period  of  24  months  is recommended.

## 6 Discussion and Conclusion

The  ECoProM-D  maturity  model  and  method  provide  a  compact  instrument  specifically  tailored  to  the  requirements  of  digital  PM  for  municipals  in  the  context  of  digital transformation.  With  its  integrated  approach  and  the  provision  of  a  standardized  questionnaire  with  a  multi-level  answer  and  evaluation  scale  corresponding  to  the  maturity levels,  the  model  enables  a  differentiated  determination  of  the  maturity  level  of  digital project  management  in  municipal  administrations.

Beyond  the  focus  on  municipalities,  the  model  is  characterized  by  the  integration of the  model  and  the  method  perspective.  The  integrated  model/method  perspective

on maturity assessment  contributes  to  the  design  knowledge  on  maturity  models  by demonstrating  the appropriateness of situational method  engineering  for developing new  domain-specific  maturity  models.  Furthermore,  the  emphasis  of  the  method  character  follows  the  recently  formulated  claim  for  continuous  maturity  assessment  [26]. Since  digital  transformation  is  known  to  inflict  frequent  and  extensive  change  on  organizations,  digital  PM  needs  to  incorporate  continuous  improvement  to  be  capable  of handling  change  successfully.  As  digitalization  projects  adopt  iterative  and  incremental development  processes  like  Scrum,  the  assessment  of  digital  PM  maturity  must  also adapt  to  these  new  requirements  through  a  shift  from  one-time  initiatives  to  a  continuous  process.  This  position  is  also  supported  by  the  concept  of  business  process  maturity based  on  a  lifecycle  view  of  business  processes  [43].

In  comparison  to  other  PM3s,  it  stands  out  that  ECoProMD  features  only  four  maturity  levels,  while  many  other  maturity  models  offer  five  or  more  levels.  While  more levels may  enable  a more  precise maturity assessment,  the restriction to four levels was  a  deliberate  design  decision  explicitly  demanded  by  the  involved  experts  to  reduce complexity  and  enhance  practicability.  Like  the  rest  of  ECoProMD,  the  effect  of  this decision  has  not  been  evaluated  in  the  field  yet.  It  is  one  of  the  main  limitations  at  this point  that  the  artifact  was  validated  with  a  formative  evaluation  and  a  relatively  small sample  of  experts.  Regarding  the  method  part  of  ECoProMD  the  guidance  on  performing  an  assessment  is  elaborated  in  more  detail  than  the  support  on  how  to  develop  and implement  concrete  measures  to  reach  the  next  maturity  level.  Furthermore,  the  national perspective  on  German  municipalities  may  require  adjustments  before  using  the  model in  other  countries.  To  overcome  these  and  other  limitations,  further  empirical  research on  effectiveness  and  efficiency  in  municipal  contexts  of  different  sizes  and  types  (e.g., district  administrations)  is  required.  Related  research  directions  include  the  development of  a  digital  tool  for  applying  ECoProMD  and  investigating  the  acceptance  of  the  model by  various  municipal  stakeholders.

Abstract. Swedish  municipalities  strive  to  digitalize  their  citizen  facing  services to  the  extent  possible,  directing  citizens  to  digital  self-service.  While  previous  digitalization  efforts  using  either  bottom-up  or  top-down  approaches,  these  changes often  fail  to  deliver  the  expected  outcomes,  in  terms  of  increased  efficiency.  This case study illustrates that change  can take place from the  middle-out  through the  introduction  of  municipal  contact  centers.  Using  a  routine  dynamics  lens,  we illustrate  that  by  guiding  and  educating  both  citizens  and  departments,  the  contact  center  changes  how  routines  are  performed  by  citizens,  contact  centers,  and departments  alike.  The  departments  have  to  adjust  to  the  contact  center's  demands for  increased  standardization,  codification  and  interoperability  of  routines  and  processes,  and  contact  centers  drive  cross-departmental  change  incrementally  using digital  artefacts  such  as  scripts.  These  findings  contribute  to  our  understanding how  citizen-centric  change  can  come  about  in  local  authority  and  how  routine interdependencies  can  be  used  to  leverage  organizational  change.

## 1 Introduction

Since  the  early  2000s,  many  governments  have  an  explicit  goal  to  present  citizens  with a  unified  digital  gateway,  through  which  citizens  can  access  all  government  services  and related  information;  so-called  one-stop-shops  [33].  However,  the  goal  of  streamlining and  collocate  public  service  to one  digital place,  supporting  citizens  to  easily  access services  that  they  are  eligible  for,  is  still  not  reached.  Digital  public  services  are  often made  available  separately,  in  an  uncoordinated  fashion,  typically  through  each  public organization's  website.  This  places  burden  on  citizens  to  identify  and  match  the  right service  to  their  life  situation,  and  to  understand  how  to  comply  to  the  application  process [24].  A  large  portion  of  citizens  find  this  challenging,  especially  those  in  vulnerable  life situations  [16].

The  reasons  why  coordination  of  digital  service  delivery  is  difficult  are  many,  e.g.,  due to  conflicting  legal  frameworks  between  policy  areas,  incompatible  technical  solutions across  and  within  organizations,  and  conflicting  stakeholder  views  and  values  regarding what  services  and  policy  areas  can  and  should  be  digitalized.  Furthermore,  although  citizens  are  considered  the  main  stakeholder  for  digital  government  and  central  to  creating public  value  [1,  28],  the  citizen  perspective  is  often  lacking  in  digital  government  [8].

However,  citizens are not only on the receiving end of public services, they are also  important  actors  in  its  delivery,  as  co-producers  of  the  service  interaction  [27].  In the  Swedish  setting,  the  large  majority  of  citizens  are  digitally  literate  and  use  digital self-services  to  a  large  extent  [42].  Still,  some  citizens  cannot,  or  do  not  want  to,  use digital services as their way  of interacting  with  government.  According  to  Swedish law,  government  organizations  are  obliged  to  offer  help  through  call  centers  or  physical contact  centers  to which  citizens  can  go  in person  to get support.  This  goes  also  for the  local  level  of  government,  where  many  municipalities  have  dedicated  citizen  contact centers  for  this  purpose.  At  these  centers,  citizens  can  use  computers  with  internet  access and printers, and the personnel  have a pronounced  mission  to  help citizens  become digitally  literate,  to  enable  digital  self-service.

The  aim  of  this  paper  is  to  explore  how  the  work  performed  at  municipal  contact  centers  drives  change  through  the  municipality.  We  investigate  this  through  a  qualitative  case study  performed  at  a  Swedish  municipality,  and  by  applying  a  routine  dynamics  lens  on the  empirical  data  [cf.  13,  14].  Our  research  aim  builds  on  an  underlying  assumption  that when  the  contact  center  assists  and  educates  the  citizens,  they  contribute  to  an  increased use  of  digital  technologies  among  the  citizens,  as  well  as  decreased  interactions  between citizens  and  the  various  service  departments.  Additionally,  as  the  routines  performed by  citizens  and  contact  centers  change,  routines  elsewhere  are  also  affected  [cf.  9,  20, 32,  34].  Using  case  study  data,  we  illustrate  that  interdependencies  between  routines in  the  contact  center  and  the  departments  carry  changes  across  departments  and  functions  within  the  organization.  As  the  departments  have  to  adjust  to  the  contact  center's demands  for  increased  standardization,  codification  and  interoperability  of  routines  and processes,  contact  centers  are  driving  cross-departmental  change  incrementally  through the  use  of  digital  artefacts  such  as  scripts.

After  introducing  the  empirical  background,  we  present  routine  dynamics  as  a  theoretical  lens.  Next,  we  present  data  generation  techniques  for  our  qualitative  case  study and  further  explore  the  research  setting.  We  then  use  the  process  of  Social  Assistance claims  to  illustrate  how  the  routine  plays  out,  and  discuss  how  changes  in  this  routine, following  the  actions  of  the  Contact  Center,  bring  ripple  effects  through  the  organization as  a  whole.  We  conclude  with  our  main  findings  and  directions  for  further  research.

## 2 Background

Local  government  in  Sweden  is  organized  in  290  separate  municipalities  that  are,  to  a large  extent,  self-governed,  as  long  as  they  adhere  to  the  Swedish  Local  Government  Act. The  act  regulates  the  relationship  between  the  government  and  the  municipalities,  but also  stipulates  that  all  citizens  in  Sweden,  regardless  of  where  in  Sweden  they  live,  are entitled  to  a  defined  set  of  municipal  services,  such  as  social  services,  schools,  building

permissions,  and  care  for  small  children  and  the  elderly.  How  municipalities  organize these  services  is  largely  up  to  the  local  authorities  themselves,  but  typically  the  operations  are  split  up  into  separate  departments  dealing  with  e.g.  education,  social  services, and  environment  and  urban  planning.  These  departments  are  politically  steered  and  are typically  managed  independently,  with  separate  budgets.  In  addition,  each  municipality has  a  set  of  centrally  organized  support  functions  that  supply  internal  services  to  the departments,  e.g.,  the  IT  department  and  the  HR  and  finance  functions.

## 2.1 Digital  Transformation  in  Swedish  Municipalities

Based  on  traditional  ideas  on  how  to  govern  IT-infrastructure  in  a  large  organization, Swedish  municipalities  typically  organize  digital  technology  through  a  buyer-seller  relationship between  the Service and IT departments.  This usually works  well for  dayto-day  IT-related  issues  such  as  ordering  and  maintenance,  and  up-keep  of  basic  ITinfrastructure.  However,  for  larger  change  initiatives  crossing  departmental  boundaries, municipalities  are  struggling  to  make  this  relationship  work  [21].  In  short,  it  is  difficult to  start  and  manage  inter-departmental  change- and  digitalization  initiatives  in  Swedish local  authorities  [22,  36,  40].  Such  initiatives  often  involve  competition  between  departments  and  conflicts  regarding  what  should  be  digitalized,  who  should  run  and  pay  for a  project,  what  digital  solutions  are  appropriate,  and  who  should  be  responsible  for  the technology  when  it  is  up  and  running  [21,  37].  Additionally,  the  different  departments  are guided  by  different,  and  sometimes  conflicting,  legal  frameworks.  Collaboration  is  made yet  more  difficult  by  each  department  having  the  autonomy  to  put  their  own  routines  and processes  in  place,  as  well  as  using  IT-systems  that  are  not  necessarily  compatible  with systems  used  by  other  departments  within  the  same  municipality.

To overcome these challenges, many municipalities have created digitalization groups  to  run  digitalization  initiatives  on  a  strategic  level  [21].  An  earlier  research  project followed  several  such  digitalization  groups  and  found  that  their  attempts  faced  resistance and  obstacles  within  the  organization  as  they  were  lacking  both  mandate  and  budget  to realize  the  various  digitalization  initiatives  on  their  own  [21].  The  actual  digitalization projects  still  have  to  be  led  and  financed  by  the  individual  departments  to  be  successful. The  initiatives  launched  by  the  digitalization  groups  also  frequently  tend  to  be  of  a  more visionary  and  abstract  kind  [38]  and  can  be  difficult  for  the  departments  to  translate  into concrete  actions.  Hence,  Swedish  municipalities  have  tried  both  the  bottom-up  approach to  digital  change,  letting  the  departments  buy  services  from  IT,  and  the  top-down  approach,  appointing  a  digitalization  group  managing  digitalization  from  above.  However, both  approaches  have  struggled  to  achieve  the  intended  results  and  digitalization  in  the municipalities  is  going  slower  than  planned.

## 2.2 Routines  and  Routine  Interdependencies

Organizational  routines  have  since  long  been  recognized  as  important  drivers  of  both organizational  stability  and  change  [6,  13,  14,  31].  As  such  they  are  often  targeted  when organizations  try  to  change  [4,  5,  11,  15,  19].  However,  deliberately  changing  routines can  be  difficult,  partly  because  organizations  often  fail  to  recognize  that  when  routines are  performed,  the  actors  are  simultaneously  carrying  out  situated  actions  in  the  here

and  now, as  well  as creating  and  recreating  long  term  structures  and  patterns  [13,  14]. When  the  complex  dynamics  between  the  performing  and  patterning  aspects  of  routines and  their  subsequent  potential  for  endogenous  change  are  overlooked,  change  may  not happen  as  intended  [e.g.  10,  12,  30].  Another  reason  for  why  it  can  be  hard  to  target routines  when  changing  organizations  is  that  routines  do  not  operate  in  isolation  [3]. They  are  often  intertwined  with  a  large  network  of  routines  and  the  interdependencies and  intersections  can  be  hard  to  overview  [17,  29,  35].

Interdependent  routines have, in previous research, been theorized through their boundaries  [20]  and  intersections  [35],  or  as,  e.g.,  clusters  [19]  and  ecologies  [3,  34].  In this  paper  we  explore  interdependencies  between  routines  across  department  boundaries and  define  two,  or  more,  routines  as  being  interdependent  when  the  performance  of  one routine  enables  or  constrains  the  performances  of  the  other  [20].

Routine  interdependencies  add  to  complexity  and  have  been  shown  to  be  hindering change  when  changes  in  one  routine  are  blocked  by  rigidity  in  another  [19,  26].  Additionally,  routine  interdependencies  have  also  been  seen  to  be  the  cause  of  routine  breakdowns when  interdependencies  are  viewed  differently  by  different  actors  [41].  However,  routine interdependencies  can  also,  when  flexibly  performed,  be  important  drivers  for  innovation  and  novelty.  Deken  et  al.  [7],  for  example,  take  a  temporal  perspective  and  show how  actors  anticipate  or  adapt  to  routine  interdependencies  to  create  novel  outcomes. Sele  and  Grand  [34]  show  how  actants  take  on  the  role  of  mediators  or  intermediaries  to modify  or  maintain  connections  between  routines  in  innovative  work.  Similarly,  Dönmez  et  al.  [9]  argue  that  by  manipulating  interdependencies  between  routines,  actors  can balance  stability  and  change.

In  this  study  we  will  build  on  previous  research  by  showing  that  routine  interdependencies  can  also  be  used  to push change  through  an,  otherwise  quite  rigid,  organization. By  focusing  on  the  interdependencies  between  routines,  we  therefore  shift  the  focus  from how  routines  are  performed  and  changed  by  the  citizens,  contact  centers,  and  department in  isolation  to  how  the  connections  between  them  drive  change  throughout  the  entire process,  across  intra-organizational  boundaries.

## 3 Data  Collection

We  have  carried  out  a  case  study  within  a  bigger-sized  municipality  in  south-eastern Sweden.  This  case  study  is  part  of  a  larger  research  project  studying  digitalization  of public  services  in  Norway,  Sweden  and  Denmark  [18],  funded  by  the  Norwegian  Labor and  Welfare  Administration  (NA V)  and  the  Research  Council  of  Norway.  In  this  particular  case  study,  we  have  focused  on  the  case  handling  process  for  social  assistance  (SA) claims.  We  have  conducted  semi-structured  interviews  with  employees  working  with  SA provision  at  the  municipality  (5  interviewees),  as  well  as  with  employees  working  at  the contact  center  (3  interviewees).  We  have  also  carried  out  a  process  mapping  workshop together  with  managers  and  SA  case  workers  (6  participants).  In  addition,  we  conducted an  interview  survey  with  66  citizens  visiting  the  contact  center.  The  collected  data  was analyzed  based  on  an  interpretive  approach  [25,  39]  to  identify  the  routines  carried  out, by  what  actors,  and  for  what  purposes.  The  main  goal  of  the  analysis  was  to  identify  core routine  characteristics  and  understand  how  changes  in  the  routine  affects  other  parts  of the  organization.

## 4 Research  Setting

Municipality  East  is  a  bigger-sized  municipality  located  in  the  south-eastern  parts  of Sweden.  In  2019,  the  municipality  created  a  shared  contact  center  for  all  citizen-related services.  The  contact  center  is  a  service  function  for  all  the  departments  in  the  municipality,  where  frontline  personnel  can  answer  simple  questions  and  pass  the  more  complex issues  on  to  the  appropriate  employees  in  the  respective  departments.  The  core  of  the operations  of  the  contact  center  is  a  set  of  digital  tools,  in  which  the  resources  that  are key  to  the  interaction  with  the  citizens  can  be  found.  These  resources  include  e.g.  definitions  and  descriptions  of  services  and  basic  rules  and  regulations,  and  scripts  for  the most  commonly  asked  questions.  These  scripts  are  authored  by  personnel  working  at  the service  departments,  in  collaboration  with  the  personnel  working  at  the  contact  center. The  work  at  the contact  center is  guided  and  influenced  by  input  from  both  citizens contacting  the  center  and  by  employees  working  in  the  various  departments.

The  contact  center  is  hence  operating  the  very  interface  between  the  citizens  and the  different  departments  in  the  municipality.  As  such  they  therefore,  on  one  hand,  have insights  into,  and  generate  data  on,  the  challenges  citizens  experience  with  the  services and  information  provided  by  the  municipalities.  On  the  other  hand,  the  contact  centers are  also  in  direct  contact  with  the  employees  in  the  departments,  with  whom  they  work closely to  formalize and document  processes,  routines, and standardized  answers  to citizens'  questions.  As  such, they have  the ability  to  identify  concrete  problems  and areas  of  improvement  in  the  daily  work  of  the  departments.

At  Municipality  East,  one  of  the  services  that  require  the  most  attention  of  the  contact center  personnel  is  Social  Assistance,  officially  handled  by  the  Department  of  Integration and  Labor  Affairs.  Social  Assistance  (SA)  is  a  form  of  short-term,  minimum  economic support  for  people  in  need.  For  social  assistance,  eligibility  and  subsidy  levels  are  subject to  extensive  means-testing,  with  eligibility  determined  by  individual  caseworkers  [2]. In  2023,  approximately  146  000  households  in  Sweden  were  granted  social  assistance of some  kind  [43]. SA  is subject to  much  public  debate  on  fraudulent  behavior;  the case handling practice is therefore focused on control of the applicant's claims and submitted  information,  while  still  ensuring  that  those  in  need  receive  the  assistance  they are  entitled  to.  These  characteristics  make  SA  an  interesting  public  service  to  investigate, as  is  involves  heavy  case  work,  for  both  citizen  and  case  worker,  and  the  outcome  of  the process  is  of  great  importance  to  the  applicant.

## 5 Social  Assistance  Application  and  Case  Handling  Process

The  social  assistance  application  and  case  handling  process  typically  starts  by  a  trigger, something  that  changes  in  the  life  situation  of  the  citizen.  This  might  be  a  change  in income  due  to  changes  in  employment  status  or  that  the  citizen  no  longer  qualifies  for e.g.  unemployment  benefits.  It  could  also  be  an  increase  in  costs  due  to  spiking  energy prices  or  a  new  family  member.  The  citizen  then  firstly  has  to  identify  that  support  exists before  they  send  in  the  application.  When  the  department  receives  the  application,  they review  it  and  either  make  a  decision  up-front  or  contact  the  citizen  if  there  is  a  need  for additional  information.  When  a  decision  has  been  made,  the  decision  is  communicated

to  the  citizen.  If  the  application  has  been  approved,  money  is  paid  out  by  the  Department and  the  process  is  over,  at  least  for  this  time.  If  the  application  has  been  rejected,  the citizen  can  decide  to  accept  the  rejection  or  appeal  it.  If  accepted,  the  process  ends.  If appealed,  the  citizen  will  have  to  go  through  the  steps  again.  For  an  overview  of  the social  assistance  application  and  case-handling  process,  see  Fig.  1.

## 5.1 Change  in  Life  Situation  and  Identifying  the  Support

Citizens of  all  ages  and  backgrounds  can  be  found  among  those  applying  for  social assistance  from  the  municipality,  but  according  to  the  social  workers  handling  the  cases at  the  Department,  the  most  common  applicants  are  single,  unemployed  men,  women of  non-Swedish  background  who  are  aged  55+  and  have  various  health  conditions,  and young  adults  suffering  from  addiction  or  mental  health  issues.  This  means  that  many  of those  applying  are  vulnerable,  finding  themselves  in  a  situation  where  they  have  no  assets and  where  they  are  struggling  to  make  ends  meet.  There  is  also  an  over-representation of  people  with  no  or  very  little  education,  illiteracy,  as  well  as  low  level  of  knowledge of  the  Swedish  language  and/or  the  workings  of  the  Swedish  system.

There  are  many  ways  for  a  citizen  to  find  out  about  the  municipal  social  assistance. According  to  our  respondents,  some  citizens  are  able  to  find  the  information  themselves on  the  municipality's  website,  whereas  others  may  have  been  advised  by  health  care providers  or  other  public  institutions  or  agencies  to  contact  the  municipality.  Some  have also  heard  about  the  social  assistance  support  system  from  their  personal  networks.  A frequently  re-occurring  issue  at  this  stage  is  that  many  believe  that  you  qualify  for  social assistance  support  by  just  being  a  resident  in  the  municipality,  which  is  not  the  case  (as

per  the  requirements  stated  above).The  contact  center  plays  an  important  role  in  guiding citizens  in  these  matters  as  they  are  the  first  point  of  contact  the  citizen  will  have  with the  municipality,  regardless  of  if  the  contact  happens  by  phone,  mail,  or  by  walking  in in  person  to  one  of  the  three  physical  centers  set  up  around  Municipality  East.

The  identification  of  the  social  assistance  is  a  one-off  thing  for  the  individual  citizen,  but  for  the  Contact  Center  this  is  a  recurring  routine,  in  which  they  will  engage repeatedly.  In  our  particular  case,  the identification  routine ends  in  the  identification  of the  municipal  social  assistance,  but  the  outcome  of  the  routine  depends  on  the  needs  and issues  of  the  citizen  in  question.  For  all  stages  of  the  process,  the  staff  at  the  Contact Center  has  received  training  and  education  in  how  to  help  the  citizens  out  and  are  also acting  according  to  a  pre-established  script.  These  scripts  are  originally  developed  by the  different  departments,  but  are  continuously  changed  and  updated,  partly  based  on feedback  from  the  Contact  Center.  As  the  scripts  develop,  the  Contact  Center  can  answer increasingly  more  complex  questions,  thereby  relieving  the  departments  of  some  of  their work.

Through  each  performance  of  the  routine,  the  Contact  Center  also  learns  more  about the  particular  challenges  and  pain-points  of  the  citizens  of  the  municipality,  which  is information  that  can  later  be  communicated  to  the  respective  departments.  The  departments  are  not  actively  participating  in  this  routine,  but  they  are  indirectly  affecting  its performance  by  providing,  and  updating,  the  scripts.

## 5.2 Applying  for  Social  Assistance

When  the  identification  has  been  completed  and  social  assistance  has  been  identified as  a  potential  solution,  the  citizen  needs  to  prepare  and  submit  an  application,  thereby initiating the application  routine .  The  application  can  be  submitted  either  through  an e-service available on the municipality  website  or by handing  in a printed, physical application.  If  handing  in  the  application  physically,  this  can  be  done  either  by  posting it  to  the  municipality  or  by  handing  it  in  directly  at  the  Contact  Center.

From  the  perspective  of  the  Department,  it  is  preferrable  if  the  citizen  submits  their application  digitally  through  the  e-service  as  this  will  allow  for  a  smoother  case  handling process  in  the  next  stage  (even  though  this  can  be  questioned  as  well,  which  we  will get  back  to  later).  However,  according  to  the  Department,  only  52%  of  applications  are submitted  digitally  at  the  moment,  meaning  that  almost  half  of  the  applications  are  still submitted  physically.

There  are  several  reasons  why  citizens  decide  to  submit  their  application  physically instead  of  using  the  e-service.  Our  interviews  with  citizens  as  well  as  staff  at  the  Contact Center  and  the  Department  show  that  there  are  many  citizens  who  either  don't  have access  to a  computer  or  who  have  very  little  experience  with  digital  technologies  in general.  The  Contact  Center  plays  an  important  role  here  as  citizens  can  come  to  the Contact  Center  and  use  one  of  the  computers  set  up  in  the  public  area  there  to  fill  in  and submit  an  application.  The  staff  at  the  Contact  Center  is  also  available  to  help  out  and explain  how  the  technology  works  and  how  the  application  can  be  filled  in.  As  many who  apply  for  social  assistance  are  recurring  applicants,  by  providing  this  service,  the Contact  Center  is  actively  helping  the  Department  to  increase  the  number  of  applications submitted  digitally  via  the  e-service.

Interestingly  enough,  some  of  the  citizens  we  spoke  to  said  that  the  reason  why  they did  not  use  the  e-service  was  because  their  case  worker  had  told  them  not  to.  As  we could  not  speak  to  the  respective  case  workers,  we  do  not  know  for  sure  that  the  message had  been  interpreted  correctly  by  the  applicant,  but  we  also  had  members  of  staff  both at  the  Contact  Center  and  the  Department  confirming  that  this  happened,  albeit  rarely. The  reasons  for  why  a  case  worker  would  prefer  to  receive  the  application  could  be  for example  that  if  the  application  is  not  filled  in  correctly,  which  is  often  the  case  due  to the  applicant's  poor  knowledge  of  Swedish,  it  is  easier  for  the  case  worker  to  manually correct  the  application  if  it  hasn't  been  logged  digitally.  The  Contact  Center  assisting the  citizens  to  fill  in  the  digital  application  therefore  becomes  even  more  important,  as it  improves  the  reliability  of  the  e-service  also  internally.

In  connection  with  the  application,  the  citizen  has  to  also  submit  a  number  of  documents  to  back  up  the  figures  they  state  in  the  application.  These  documents  could  be, among  others,  copies  of  electricity  bills,  invoices  for  rent,  and  doctor  notes.  When  applying  for  social  assistance  for  the  first  time,  all  claims  have  to  be  supported  by  relevant documentation.  However,  for  recurring  applications, the  requirements  on  supporting documentation  are  not  as  extensive  as  long  as  the  stated  costs  are  recurring  and  don't change.

Usually,  all  supporting  documentation  should  be  provided  at  the  time  of  application. However,  if  documentation  is  missing,  the  Department  will  ask  the  citizen  to  provide the  missing  information  before  the  case  can  be  processed.  While  documentation  can  be provided  digitally  in  connection  with  the  application,  if  the  citizen  needs  to  add  anything to  the  application  after  it  has  been  submitted,  they  need  to  send  this  by  post  or  e-mail  to the  relevant  case  worker  within  the  Department.  Many  of  the  citizens  we  spoke  to  had submitted  their  application  digitally  but  were  using  the  Contact  Center  to  post  additional documentation  physically.

The application routine provides the Contact Center with a great opportunity to learn  more  about  the  challenges  the  citizens  face  in  connection  with  the  application.  The Contact  Center  therefore  acts  as  a  collector  of  information  and  data  that  can  be  used  to improve  the  application  routine  in  general.  As  the  Department  is  particularly  interested in  increasing  the  number  of  applications  submitted  through  the  e-service,  the  Contact Center  can  provide  important  knowledge  on  improvements  that  could  lead  to  increased digital  application  rates.  Similar  to  the  identification  routine,  future  changes  and  updates from  the  Department  to  the  Contact  Center  are  provided  through  scripts.

## 5.3 Case  Handling

During  both  the  identification  and  the  application  routine,  the  Department  has  mainly played  an  indirect  role.  However,  once  the  application  routine  has  been  concluded  and the  application  has  been  submitted,  the  Department  steps  in  to  perform  the case  handling routine. At  this  stage,  the  process  differs  depending  on  the  mode  of  application.  In  the case  of  a  digital  application,  the  application  is  automatically  registered  in  the  system  and assigned  to  the  relevant  case  worker.  All  the  information  provided  in  the  application  is automatically  registered  and  the  system  performs  a  preliminary  calculation  of  whether the  citizen  is  entitled  to  social  assistance  or  not.  However,  according  to  our  respondents  at the  Department,  these  preliminary  calculations  'always'  have  to  be  corrected  manually.

The  system  automatically  accepts  all  stated  costs,  which  is  something  the  case  workers often  have  to  correct  by  manually  going  through  the  provided  documents  to  verify  that the  costs  stated  are  actually  qualifying  for  social  assistance.  If  not,  the  case  worker  has to  change  the  numbers  manually.

In  the  case  of  analog  applications,  the  case  worker  enters  all  the  details  in  the  system manually  and  the  system  then  proceeds  to  do  the  same  calculations  as  above.  The  case worker  registers  the  supporting  documents  and  saves  them  along  with  the  physical  files. Normally,  supporting  documentation  will  not  be  scanned  unless  it  contains  information that  will  help  to  understand  and  follow  the  case  going  forward.  An  important  difference however  between  digital  and  analog  applications  is  the  randomized  controls.  As  mentioned  earlier,  for  recurring  applicants,  the  need  to  provide  supporting  documentation is  not  as  extensive  as  for  new  applicants.  However,  the  system  performs  randomized controls,  implying  that  even  for  recurring  applications  where  nothing  has  changed,  additional  documentation  could  be  requested.  In  that  case,  the  citizen  receives  a  message  on the  application  page  saying  that  they  have  been  randomly  selected  and  that  additional information  is  required.  These  randomized  controls  do  not  happen  when  the  application has  been  submitted  in  physical  form.  However,  case  workers  often  have  to  contact  the applicant  anyway  for  additional  information  even  in  the  case  of  analog  applications. Hence,  according  to  the  staff  at  the  Department,  citizens  have  not  yet  figured  out  that randomized  controls  happen  for  digital  applications  but  not  for  analog,  and  this  should therefore  not  be  influencing  the  citizen's  decision  to  submit  applications  in  digital  or analog  form.

During  this  part  of  the  process,  which  should  normally  take  around  ten  days,  the citizen  waits.  It  is  also  during  this  part  of  the  process  that  the  Contact  Center  gets  the most  phone  calls  from  citizens  regarding  the  process,  and  we  have  named  this  part  of the  process  the waiting  and  answering  routine ,  reflecting  the  role  of  the  citizen  and  the Contact  Center  respectively.  Many  call  in  and  want  to  know  the  status  of  their  particular application. Many  are  of course  desperate  and  therefore impatient, but for  some  the handling  of  their  application  could  also  be  delayed  for  a  number  of  reasons.  The  most common  reason  for  delays  is  that  the  case  worker  is  awaiting  additional  information that  has  not  yet  been  provided.  When  digital  applications  have  been  selected  for  random controls,  a  message  pops  up  after  the  application  has  been  submitted,  stating  that  the applicant  needs  to  provide  additional  information.  This  message  then  goes  away  and  is quite  easy  to  miss.  In  those  cases  where  the  citizen  didn't  notice  the  message,  they  might not  find  out  that  their  case  worker  is  waiting  for  them  to  provide  additional  information until  the  time  social  assistance  would  normally  show  up  on  their  bank  account.

If  the  application  has  been  submitted  in  the  e-service,  the  citizen  can  log  in  to  the system  to  check  the  status  of  their  application.  However,  if  the  application  was  sent  in  in analog  form,  the  citizen  will  have  to  call  to  get  the  information  they  require.  As  the  case workers  can  only  be  called  during  set  hours,  30  min  a  day,  the  impatient  citizen  often calls  the  Contact  Center  to  receive  news  on  the  status  of  the  application.  When  receiving a  call  from  a  citizen,  the  staff  at  the  Contact  Center  can  help  by  either  directing  the  citizen to  the  correct  case  worker  (if  the  citizen  doesn't  know  who  their  case  worker  is),  or  by answering  their  questions  according  to  the  previously  mentioned  script.  By  assisting  the citizens  during  this  stage,  the  Contact  Center  can  hopefully  explain  and  clarify  issues  in

a  way  that  prevents  the  same  issues  occurring  the  next  time  the  citizen  applies  for  social assistance.  As  such,  this  stage  also  provides  an  opportunity  for  the  Contact  Center  to both  further  understand  the  challenges  faced  by  the  citizens  regarding  the  process,  as well  as  a  way  of  improving  future  performances  of  the  application  routine.

## 5.4 Receive  Decision  and  Payment

When  a  decision  has  been  made,  the  decision  is  communicated  either  thorough  the  eservice,  if  the  application  was  made  digitally,  or  by  post,  if  the  application  was  submitted in  analog  form.  If  the  application  has  been  approved,  this  is  normally  the  end  of  the  story for  now  and  money  is  paid  out.  However,  if  rejected,  the  citizen  can  appeal  the  decision and  request  a  re-evaluation  of  their  application.  Sometimes,  all  the  citizen  needs  to  do  is provide  additional  documentation  or  clarify  certain  items  in  their  original  application. Common  reasons  for  rejection  are  that  the  citizen  has  not  followed  the  financial  plan that  has  been  set  up  for  them  together  with  the  Department  in  connection  with  previous  applications,  that  the  citizen  has  had  additional  incomes  such  as  an  inheritance  or gambling  profits,  that  the  citizen  claims  they  don't  have  the  assets  or  the  income  that  the Department  says  they  have,  or  that  they  have  not  been  able  to  support  their  claims  with the  relevant  documents.  Sometimes  the  citizen  is  also  claiming  to  be  the  only  provider  in a  household,  even  though  the  Department  has  information  that  would  suggest  that  that's not  the  case.

If  everything  runs  smoothly,  the communication  routine normally  involves  only  the Department  and  the  citizen.  However,  when  issues  occur,  the  Contact  Center  quite  often gets  involved  in  clearing  these.  A  common  problem  at  this  stage  is  that  the  citizen  might not  fully  understand  the  decision,  or  the  grounds  on  which  it  was  made.  This  could  be due  to  issues  with  the  language  or  lack  of  knowledge  of  how  the  Swedish  system  works and  its  rules  and  regulations,  or  simply  because  the  citizen  has  not  understood  what  it  is that  the  municipality  is  responsible  for  and  what  sort  of  support  they  can  provide.

Most  of  those  who  apply  for  social  assistance  will  apply  also  the  following  month, regardless  of  whether  their  last  application  was  approved  or  not.

## 6 Discussion

The  main  contribution  in  this  study  lies  in  showing  the  ways  through  which  routine interdependencies  function  as  drivers  of  change  in  public  service  delivery  by  studying  the introduction  of  contact  centers  in  Swedish  municipalities.  We  build  on  previous  studies who  have  shown  that  routine  interdependencies  can  be  inhibitors  of  change  [e.g.  19,  26] as  well  as  creators  of  novel  outcomes  [e.g.  7,  34]  and  show  that  routine  interdependencies can  also  be  used  to  push  change  across  intraorganizational  boundaries.  From  the  findings we  see  that  by  acting  as  an  intermediary  between  the  Department  and  the  citizens,  the Contact  Center  takes  an  active  part  in  how  routines  are  evolving  for  both.

As  can  be  seen  from  the  description  of  the  social  assistance  application  and  case handling  process, the citizen, the Department,  and  the  Contact  Centers  are  involved at  different  degrees  during  the  various  stages  of  the  process.  Regardless  of  who  performs  the  routine  during  each  stage,  throughout  the  process  there  is  also  an  exchange  of information,  guidance  and  instructions  between  the  actors  as  illustrated  by  Fig.  2.

## 6.1 Educating  and  Guiding  Citizens

During  every  stage  of  the  process,  the  Contact  Center  assists  citizens  with  their  interaction with the Department.  By  doing so, the Contact Center doesn't just provide help in the  moment.  They  also  provide  guidance  that  affects  future  iterations  of  the  respective routines,  which  will  in  turn  affect  how  other  routines  in  the  process  are  performed  also going  forward.  The  most  prominent  example  of  this  is  when  citizens  enter  the  Contact Center  to  get  help  with  filling  in  an  application  using  the  e-service.  Firstly,  by  providing access to computers,  the  Contact  Center  ensures that all citizens have the option of submitting  the  application  digitally  in  the  first  place.  For  many  of  the  citizens  applying on-site,  digital  applications  would  not  have  been  an  alternative  unless  they  were  able to  use  the  computers  located  at  the  Contact  Center.  Secondly,  by  providing  guidance and  explaining  every  step  of  the  application,  the  Contact  Center  improves  the  chances of  the  citizen  being  able  to  submit  a  digital  application  on  their  own  the  next  time  they apply. Hence,  the  Contact  Center  improves  the  digital  literacy of the citizens  during the  application  routine,  thereby  affecting  both  how  the  application  routine  is  performed in  the  future  as  well  as  how  the  next  step  in  the  process,  the  case  handling  routine,  is performed  in  both  this  and  future  iterations  of  the  process.  Additionally,  the  Contact Center  provides  guidance  also  later  in  the  process,  during  the  waiting/answering  routine as  well  as  the  communication  routine.  What  the  citizen  learns  during  the  performance of  these  routines  will  also  feed  into  to  the  next  performance  of  the  application  routine, thereby  enhancing  the  effects  even  further.

The  Contact  Centers  are  thus  actively  involved  in  how  routines  largely  performed  by the  citizen  are  performed  and  patterned,  and  subsequently  also  how  it  evolves  over  time [13,  14].  As  the  next  routine  in  the  process  is  dependent  on  how  the  previous  routine has been performed  [20]  this change  is carried through  also to  subsequent  routines, enhancing  the  effects  of  the  Contact  Center's  guidance  even  further.

## 6.2 Collecting  Data  for  the  Department

As  can  be  seen  from  Fig.  2,  the  Contact  Center  not  only  educates  citizens.  It  also  educates the  Department  by  collecting  information  and  data  on  the  citizens.  Through  their  close interaction  with  the  citizens  applying  for  social  assistance,  the  Contact  Center  can  provide the  Department  with  insights  on  where  in  the  process  the  citizen  encounters  problems  and obstacles.  This  information  can  be  used  by  the  Department  to  improve  how  applications are  designed,  both  in  digital  and  analog  form,  thereby  making  future  iterations  of  the process  run  more  efficiently  for  both  citizens  and  the  Department.  By  making  especially the  digital  application  easier  to  use,  the  Department  can  also  improve  digital  application rates,  thereby  improving  efficiency  also  in  the  long  run.  By  guiding  both  citizens  and the  Department  on  the  needs  and  challenges  of  the  other,  the  Contact  Center  modify  the connections  between  the  routines  and,  in  the  long  run,  drive  change  in  how  the  routines are  performed  going  forward  [34].  As  above,  those  changes  are  carried  through  also  to the  subsequent  routines  in  the  process,  and  so  forth.  As  shown  also  by  Deken  et  al.  [7] and  Sele  and  Grand  [34],  networks  of  interdependent  routines  hence  have  generative properties  in  themselves  that,  when  understood  and  harnessed,  can  be  important  drivers of  change.

There  is  also  another  important  aspect  of  the  Contact  Center's  close  contact  with  the citizens.  As  the  Contact  Center  interacts  with  the  citizens  on  a  regular  basis,  they  gain  an understanding  of  the  situations  and  circumstances  surrounding  each  case.  This,  in  turn, becomes  valuable  information  to  help  the  Department  work  proactively  with  vulnerable citizens  going  forward.  In  a  best-case-scenario,  such  proactive  measures  would  improve the  situation  for  the  citizens  and,  ultimately,  decrease  the  number  of  applications  for social  assistance  in  the  future.

## 6.3 Triggering  Change  by  Forcing  the  Department  to  Map  Routines

The  Contact  Center  works  as  the  single  point  of  contact  for  citizens  wanting  to  get  in touch  with  the  municipality.  The  Contact  Center  therefore  has  to  handle  questions  and cases  related  to  most  of  the  departments  within  the  municipality.  However,  while  the case  workers  who  used  to  answer  the  questions  from  citizens  before  the  introduction  of contact  centers  are  experts  within  their  field,  the  staff  at  the  Contact  Center  are  not.  They are  certainly  more  knowledgeable  than  most  of  us,  but  it  would  be  impossible  for  them to  know  the  ins  and  outs  of  all  six  departments  within  Municipality  East.

They  way  this  has  been  solved  is  that  the  departments,  such  as  the  Department  of integration  and  labor  market  affairs,  have  provided  the  Contact  Center  with  thorough scripts.  The  scripts  describe  each  process  in  great  detail  and  can  be  found  within  the digital  resources  of  the  municipality.  The  staff  at  the  Contact  Center  start  by  performing a  keyword  search  taking  them  to  the  relevant  script.  They  can  then  implement  the  script by  following  a  number  of  if-then  step-by-step  instructions.  From  a  routines'  perspective, the  Department  has  been  forced  to  expose  routines  and  processes  that  have  previously been  performed  quite  automatically,  relying  on  the  competence  and  experience  of  the individual case worker.  This, in itself, has meant  that many  inefficiencies  and  bottle necks  in  routines  have  been  identified  and  improved.

When  the  Department  changes  any  aspect  of  the  social  assistance  application  and case  handling  process  as  a  result  of  the  insights  collected  by  the  Contact  Center,  the change  will  be  communicated  to  the  Contact  Center  as  the  script  is  updated.  Many  of the  processes  in  which  the  Contact  Center  assists  change  regularly,  and  it  is  therefore important  that  Contact  Center  follows  the  scripts  in  each  interaction  with  the  citizens. Changes  to  the  process  are  therefore  both  implemented  and  communicated  through  the script.  As  the  scripts  for  answering  frequently  asked  questions  have  been  continuously developed  and  become  more  sophisticated,  the  Contact  Center  can  do  more  and  reduce the  workload  of  the  Department  even  further.  As  a  result,  routines  have  slowly  changed, both  in  the  Contact  Center  and  in  the  Department.

## 7 Conclusion

In  our  previous  research,  we  have  observed  prevailing  challenges  with  the  current  forms of  managing  and  driving  digitalization  in  Swedish  municipalities;  the  bottom-up  approach originating in the departments  does  not work  for  complex,  inter-departmental projects,  and  the  top-down  approach,  driven  by  higher  level  digitalization  groups,  fails to  instigate  change  in  the  departments  [21,  22].  However,  in  the  ongoing  research  project which  this  paper  is  based  on,  we  see  that  work  conducted  by  the  municipal  contact  centers can trigger digital transformation and the centers can push change  out into the organization,  forcing  departments  to  change  from  the  middle  out.

This  paper  has  shown  that  when  routine  interdependencies  are  understood  and  utilized,  they  can  be  used  as  powerful  drivers  of  organizational  change.  When  routines  are interdependent  across  departments  and  actors,  a  seemingly  small  change  in  one  routine, can  have  ripple  effects  on  the  routines  connected  to  it,  thereby  bringing  change  from one  end  of  an  organization  to  another.  By  acknowledging  the  interdependencies  between routines,  we  also  show  that  how  a  routine  is  performed  today  doesn't  only  enable  and  constrain  the  performance  of  the  next  routine  during  the  current  iteration,  but  also  changes how  previous  routines  in  the  process  are  performed  next  time.  When  moving  some  routines  from  one  part  of  the  organization,  while  retaining  others,  the  increased  need  for standardization,  codification  and  interoperability  can  in  turn  also  lead  to  incremental changes  and  improvements  being  implemented  and  aggregated  over  time.

The  introduction  of  a  contact  center  in  Municipality  East  has  therefore  not  just  been a  case  of  moving  a  task  from  one  role  (within  the  departments)  to  another  (at  the  contact center).  The  creation  of  the  cross-departmental  single  point  of  contact  is  continuously forcing  the  municipality  to  map  processes  and  introduce  new  digital  systems,  adapt  to citizens'  need,  and  re-design  existing  routines  -  both  within  the  contact  centers  themselves  and  in  the  departments.  Hence,  we  can  see  that  change  is  pushed  from  the  inside out,  across  intra-organizational  boundaries  through  routine  interdependencies.

Abstract. Successful  digitalization  requires  a  deep  understanding  of  the  practices surrounding  self-service  solutions.  Such  understanding  can  be  developed  through direct  interaction  between  citizens  and  service  providers.  In  this  study,  we  contribute  to  such  understanding  by  exploring  how  explicit  and  tacit  knowledge  is exchanged  during  citizen-caseworker  interactions.  We  do  so  by  examining  how citizens  and  caseworkers  share  knowledge  while  interacting  with  a  digital  selfservice  application  for  financial  assistance.  Although  self-service  solutions  aim  to improve  service  delivery  by  allowing  citizens  to  serve  themselves,  we  find  that  they can  also  create  challenges.  Citizens  need  to  acquire  relevant  knowledge  and  skills, and public employees  must  often  correct application errors and assist citizens during  service  procedures.  Our  findings  from  observations  and  interviews  reveal that  both  parties  hold  essential  knowledge  for  the  use  of  self-service  solutions. These  interactions  facilitate  bidirectional  knowledge-sharing,  enhancing  citizens' confidence  and  helping  caseworkers  refine  their  guidance  methods.

The  paper  discusses  how  knowledge-sharing  occurs  when  caseworkers  guide and  support  citizens  through  the  process  of  digital  self-service  applications  and how  these  guidance  sessions  can  benefit  the  development  and  design  of  digital self-service  solutions  in  the  public  sector.

## 1 Introduction

Governments  around  the  world  are increasingly implementing  self-service solutions with  the  aim  of  improving  service  delivery  through  easier  access  to  services  and  more efficient  case  handling  [1,  2],  as  these  technologies  enable  citizens  to  serve  themselves without  requiring  assistance  [3,  4].  However,  as  services  become  more  complex  and involve  a  network  of  people,  organizations,  technologies,  and  processes  [5,  6],  ensuring independent  use  of  self-services  becomes  more  challenging.

In  the  case  of  welfare  and  social  services,  such  complexity  is  twofold  and  concerns both  citizens'  life  situations  and  service  regulations.  Existing  research  shows  that  many citizens  require  support  in  the  handling  of  digital  self-service  solutions  as  they  struggle  to understand  the  information  provided  and  relate  it  to  their  life  situation  [6,  7].  To  successfully  engage  with  digital  self-service,  citizens  must  have  some  basic  level  of  knowledge regarding  the  public  services  they  are  applying  for.  Such  knowledge  is  embedded  in the  domain  skills  that  citizens  possess,  as  well  as  situational  experience  and  computer skills.  Acquiring  these  skills  is  often  described  as  the  learning  cost  of  self-services  [810].  Public  employees,  such  as  caseworkers,  who  assist  citizens  in  understanding  and using  digital  self-service  solutions,  become  knowledge  intermediaries  as  they  bridge these  knowledge  gaps  [11].  The  engagement  of  both  caseworkers  and  citizens  in  the self-service  procedure  is  therefore  essential  for  successful  public  service  delivery.

Self-service  solutions  pose  not  only  challenges  for  citizens  but  also  for  caseworkers who  should  gather  sufficient  knowledge  about  a  citizen's  situation  to  accurately  process  their  application  despite  not  having  direct  interaction  with  citizens  [12].  Failing  to provide  usable  self-service  may  create  extra  work  for  caseworkers  as  they  must  correct application  errors  and  assist  citizens,  leading  to  additional  organizational  costs.

Lemon  and  Verhoef  [13]  state  that  successful  digitalization  of  services  requires  a deep  understanding  of  the  citizens'  practices  surrounding  self-service  solutions,  which can  be  developed  as  citizens  directly  interact  with  caseworkers.  It  is,  however,  equally important  to  consider  the  caseworker's  practice.  In  this  study,  we  develop  such  an  understanding  of  both  practices  through  facilitated  guidance  sessions  in  which  citizens  directly interact  with  caseworkers  and  the  digital  self-service  application  for  financial  assistance, provided  by  the  Norwegian  government.

Through  an  inductive  analysis  of  our  qualitative  data, our findings  reveal several aspects  of  knowledge-sharing.  To  further  interpret  our  data,  we  adopt  Wenger's  perspective  on  knowledge-sharing,  where  explicit  and  tacit  knowledge  is  tied  to  a  specific practice.  Knowledge-sharing  and  learning  can  therefore  occur  within  one  practice  but also  where  two  or  more  practices  intersect  [14].  Applying  this  lens  helps  us  to  make sense  of  our  findings  and  answer  the  following  research  question:

RQ:  How  does  knowledge-sharing  unfold  as citizens and caseworkers  interact with digital  self-service  solutions  in  the  context  of  public  welfare  services?

The  paper  will  proceed  as  follows:  in  Sect.  2,  we  present  the  background  of  relevant literature  concerning  digital  self-service  in  the  public  sector  and  knowledge-sharing.  In Sect.  3,  we  present  our  method  and  case  description.  In  Sect.  4,  we  present  our  findings. We  present  our  discussion  in  Sect.  5,  relating  our  findings  to  Wenger's  perspective  on knowledge-sharing.  In  Sect.  6,  we  present  limitations  and  suggest  future  research.

## 2 Background

## 2.1 Digital  Self-service  in  the  Public  Sector

Self-service  is  implemented  using  a  wide  range  of  technologies,  including  ATMs  and vending  machines,  online  retail,  and  other  digital  services  provided  by  both  the  private and  public  sectors  [15].  These  technologies  enable  users  to  perform  transactions,  such

as  making  payments  or  submitting  applications,  through  a  digital  system  or  technology artefact  without  human  contact  [16].  The  aim  of  a  self-service  system  is  to  allow  even inexperienced  people  to  perform  sophisticated  tasks  quickly  [3].  Increased  convenience through  greater  accessibility  and  availability  for  the  user,  as  well  as  lower  costs  for  the service  provider,  are  some  of  the  benefits  associated  with  self-service  [17].  However, usability  challenges  are  evident  across  various  self-service  technologies,  such  as  parking meters  and  digital  self-service  portals  [18,  19].

In  the  context  of  public  services,  particularly  social  and  welfare  services,  digital  selfservice  portals  can  enhance  service  accessibility  and  significantly  benefit  individuals  who have  difficulty  visiting  service  providers  or  attending  in-person  meetings  [20].  Despite these  advantages,  several  studies  indicate  that  users  often  struggle  or  fail  to  complete self-service  tasks  when  they  don't  understand  what  is  expected  of  them[8]  or  face  difficult life  situations  that  become  further  complicated  by  self-service  interactions[21].

To  successfully  navigate  digital  service  encounters,  citizens  need  specific  domain skills,  such  as  bureaucratic  knowledge,  situational  experience,  and  computer  skills  [8, 10].  Traditionally,  caseworkers  would  possess  and  share  specialized  knowledge  with  citizens  regarding  eligibility  for  certain  services  [22].  With  the  shift  to  digital  self-services, this  knowledge  is  redistributed  away  from  caseworkers,  leading  to  an  outsourcing  of caseworker  duties  to  citizens  [23,  24].  This  redistribution  of  knowledge  can  create  challenges  for  both  caseworkers  and  citizens,  complicating  the  task  performance  for  both parties.  Caseworkers  who  handle  self-service  applications  often  deal  with  missing  and fragmented  information  in  the  applications  [12].  To  deal  with  these  issues,  caseworkers come  up  with  their  own  workarounds,  i.e.,  'tinkering'  such  as  entering  placeholder  data to  comply  with  system  requirements  [25].

Digital  self-service  solutions  integrate  various  forms  of  written  support  and  instructions, e.g., help text  or  automated  prefilling,  to  guide  users  and  increase  compliance [26],  which  is  known  as  explicit  knowledge.  However,  they  cannot  offer  practical  tacit knowledge,  which  often  plays  a  crucial  role  in  effective  service  delivery.

## 2.2 Knowledge-Sharing

E-government  literature  has  addressed  knowledge-sharing  within  the  context  of  knowledge  management  to  enhance  government  competence,  increase  the  quality  of  service, and  promote  healthy  government  development  [27].  While  knowledge  management includes  topics  such  as  organizational  learning,  knowledge  management  systems,  and knowledge  intermediation  between  government  agencies,  it  gives  little  attention  to  the knowledge-sharing  practices  that  can  occur  when  citizens  interact  with  public  organizations.  Knowledge-sharing  can  further  be  linked  to  knowledge  intermediaries  (hereafter called  intermediaries)  who  support  citizens  in  bridging  their  knowledge  gaps  and  gaining access  to  services  [28].

Intermediaries  figure  in the  digital  government  context  when  citizens  struggle  to manage  these  services  on  their  own  in  the  digital  public  service  delivery  [29,  30].  They can  be  employees  of  a  public  administration,  e.g.,  caseworkers,  or  external  actors.

We build on this literature by exploring how knowledge-sharing unfolds in caseworker-citizen  interaction  to  improve  the  use  of  digital  self-service  solutions.  Knowledge  can  be  either  explicit  or  tacit.  Explicit  knowledge  can  be  stored  and  retrieved  from

systems  such  as  books,  databases,  or  web  pages.  In  contrast,  tacit  knowledge  is  carried  by people  who,  through  their  experience,  develop  a  deep  understanding  of  complex,  interdependent  systems  [31,  32].  Tacit  knowledge-sharing  is  enabled  through  interaction  and informal  learning  processes  such  as  storytelling,  conversations,  and  coaching.  Digital self-service  solutions  can  pose  challenges  to  the  transfer  and  sharing  of  tacit  knowledge, as  the  nuances  of  tacit  knowledge  are  difficult  to  verbalize  and  put  into  data  [33].

According  to  Wenger  [14],  knowledge  is  often  tied  to  a  specific  practice.  For  instance, caseworkers  acquire  explicit  knowledge  during  their  formal  studies  but  gain  tacit  knowledge  through  practicing  their  profession.  Knowledge  can  also  be  tied  to  private  actors, e.g.,  citizens,  who  are  knowledgeable  in  practices  they  regularly  perform.

Sharing  knowledge  requires  a  shared  repertoire  of  resources,  such  as  language,  routines,  sensibilities,  tools,  etc.,  which  is  often  present  when  people  share  the  same  practice.  However,  knowledge  can  also  be  shared  across  different  practices  [14].  To  ensure knowledge-sharing  and  learning  when  two  or  more  practices  meet,  there  needs  to  be something  to  interact  about,  open  engagement  with  differences,  and  ways  to  translate between  the  repertoires  of  each  practice.  By  working  at  the  intersection  of  two  practices, people  can  become  knowledgeable  about  the  other  practice  without  being  professionals in  that  practice.  Wenger's  frameworks  on  knowledge-sharing  have  been  widely  applied in  medical  and  healthcare  research  [34],  education  [35],  and  management  [36],  among others.  However,  it  has  received  little  attention  in  the  field  of  e-government.

In our case of the digital self-service application, caseworkers  and  citizens each have  their  own  practices.  Caseworkers  are  professionals  who  have  administrative  and regulatory  knowledge  and  make  decisions  about  citizens'  eligibility  for  specific  benefits [22],  while  citizens  apply  for  services  digitally.  These  two  practices  came  together  during the  guidance  sessions,  allowing  for  knowledge-sharing  and  learning  as  they  interacted with  the  digital  self-service  application.

## 3 Method  and  Case  Description

## 3.1 The  Case

This  paper  is  based  on  the  case  of  a  digital  self-service  application  for  financial  assistance  at  the  Norwegian  Labour  and  Welfare  Administration  (NA V).  Financial  assistance (FA)  is  short-term  support  to  people  who  cannot  financially  support  themselves.  To  be entitled  to  FA,  one  must  have  legal  residency  in  Norway  [37].  In  2023,  152,500  people  in Norway  received  financial  support  [38].  Citizens  applying  for  FA  are  often  in  vulnerable situations,  such  as  being  unemployed  or  having  health  and  family  issues.  Citizens  can receive  some  degree  of  help  and  guidance  through  various  channels,  including  the  reception  area  at  a  local  NA V  office,  a  call  center,  or  during  a  meeting  with  their  counselor or  caseworker.  The  digital  self-service  was  designed  as  a  supplement  for  face-to-face meetings,  but  in  reality,  it  has  replaced  these  encounters.  This  is  not  unusual  in  the  public sector,  as  technology  is  often  introduced  to  save  public  resources  by  reducing  human interaction  [26].

The  application  can  be  found  on  NA V's  website,  nav.no,  and  requires  a  secure  login with a digital identification device (Bank-ID).  The  digital application is available in Norwegian  and  English,  but  all  guidance  sessions  were  carried  out  in  Norwegian.  The

digital  application  process  consists  of  eight  steps,  throughout  which  the  citizen  provides, confirms, or changes  contact information, relevant information on their  income  and expenses,  and  information  about  their  family  and  living  situation.  In  the  last  step,  the citizen  is  asked  to  upload  all  relevant  documentation,  such  as  a  housing  contract,  bank statements,  and  receipts.

The  digital  application  is  then  forwarded  to  a  caseworker  who  reviews  it  and  makes  a decision.  The  citizen  receives  the  decision  digitally  to  'MittNA V'  (My  NA V)  -  the  portal through  which  citizens  can  receive  information  from  NA V .  Although  FA  is  intended  as short-term  support,  typically  approved  for  only  a  few  months  at  a  time,  many  applicants require  ongoing  aid  and  must  reapply  multiple  times.

## 3.2 Data  Generation  and  Analysis

In  October  2024,  we  facilitated  one-on-one  guidance  sessions  (hereafter  called  sessions) between  caseworkers  and  citizens,  with  the  aim  of  capturing  citizens'  experiences  when digitally applying  for FA. Together  with  the participants, we  discussed  not only the usability  and  design  of  the  digital  solution  but  also  their  experiences  and  considerations regarding  comprehensibility  of  the  bureaucratic  language,  rules,  and  eligibility  criteria. Participants were asked to assess whether  they could easily understand  their rights, determine  their  eligibility  for  benefits,  identify  the  appropriate  application  processes, and  understand  what  documentation  was  required.  Additionally,  the  sessions  created possibilities  to  develop  a  shared  understanding  of  the  realities  that  actors  face  in  their different  practices.  These  guidance  sessions  simulate  elements  of  guidance  and  support as  they  may  occur  in  the  NA V  offices,  but  in  a  more  structured  and  facilitated  research context. In this way,  the study took a holistic  approach,  considering  the  intersection of interface design, bureaucratic  language,  digital  literacy, and institutional practices shaping  citizens'  experience.  In  addition  to  our  observations,  we  had  separate  interviews with  each  caseworker  and  citizen  before  and  after  their  session  (pre- and  post-interviews) (Table  1).

Table  1. Overview  of  guidance  sessions  and  participants

| Caseworker (CW)   | Session (S) and Citizens (C)     |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|
| CW1               | S1 and S2; C1 and C2             |
| CW2               | S3, S4, S5, S6; C3, C4, C5, C6   |
| CW3               | S7, S8, S9, S10; C7, C8, C9, C10 |

The  citizens  who  participated  in  the  sessions  covered  the  age  groups  from  late  teens to early 60s; six were  female,  three  were  male,  and  one  couple.  Nine  out  of  the ten participants  were  immigrants  (holding  legal  residency  in  Norway  while  being  born  in  a country  other  than  Norway).  For  some,  it  was  their  first  time  applying  digitally,  while others  have  used  the  digital  self-service  application  many  times.

All  interviews  were  semi-structured.  In  total,  10  citizens  participated  in  the  interviews and  sessions,  with  three  caseworkers  participating  on  different  days.  All  sessions  and interviews  were  held  in  Norwegian,  with  interpreters  provided  for  non-proficient  citizens.

The  pre-interviews  with  caseworkers  lasted  between  30  and  40  min  and  covered questions about their experience working  with FA  and how  they guide and support citizens  in  the  application  process.  In  the  post-interview,  we  asked  about  caseworkers' reflections  and  experiences  guiding  citizens.  The  pre- and  post-interviews  with  citizens lasted  between  10  and  20  min  each.  We  asked  about  the  citizens'  experience  with  NA V and  the  application  process  for  FA  (on  paper  and  digitally),  as  well  as  their  experience and  reflections  on  receiving  one-on-one  guidance.  The  post-interview  was  further  used to  validate  our  observations  from  the  session.

In  addition  to  field  notes,  all  interviews  and  sessions  were  recorded.  The  sessions were  observed  from  three  different  perspectives.  Two  authors  were  in  the  room,  observing the  caseworker-citizen  interaction  and  asking  questions  regarding  the  understanding  of certain  terms  and  phrases  in  the  application.  The  third  author  observed  remotely  through screen and audio sharing. This approach  allowed a thorough focus on the different interactions  between  caseworkers,  citizens,  and  the  digital  self-service  application.

A  first  round  of  qualitative  data  analysis  was  carried  out  right  after  the  data  collection, with  three  authors  sharing  and  comparing  their  notes  and  identifying  and  discussing major  themes.  The  results  of  this  analysis  were  presented  to  the  three  caseworkers  so they  could  discuss  and  verify  our  findings.

A  more  thorough  analysis  of  all  interview  transcripts  and  observation  notes,  following an  inductive  approach  [39],  was  done  in  NVivo.  The  data  analysis  included  several  rounds of  reading  and  coding,  where  categories  were  created  from  actual  phrases  or  meanings. The  categories were  refined through  continuous  revision,  combining  categories,  and searching  for  subcategories,  resulting  in  a  set  of  the  most  important  categories.  From  this analysis,  we  identified  'knowledge-sharing'  as  a  main  theme  with  related  subtopics  such as  'required  knowledge',  'Citizen-held  knowledge',  and  'caseworkers  learning  from citizens'.  Our  inductive  approach  allows  us  to  find  new  aspects  and  further  elaborate on  Wenger's  ideas  while  adopting  them  to  interpret  or  make  sense  of  the  findings,  not to  dictate  them.  By  using  Wenger·s  theoretical  approach,  we  extend  the  theory  about knowledge-sharing  to  the  digital  government  domain,  where  explicit  and  tacit  knowledge is  tied  to  specific  practices.

## 4 Findings

This section presents our findings from the data analysis, divided into the following  topics:  (1)  Knowledge  Required  by  Citizens,  (2)  Citizen-held  knowledge,  and  (3) Knowledge-Sharing  and  Learning  in  Caseworker-Citizen  Interaction.

## 4.1 Knowledge  Required  by  Citizens

Successfully  completing  the  digital  self-service  application  requires  a  combination  of knowledge  that  citizens  need  to  possess  or  obtain,  such  as  a)  language  and  regulatory knowledge,  and  b)  ICT  skills.

## a. Language  and  Regulatory  Knowledge

Understanding  and  responding  to  the  digital  application  requires  familiarity  with bureaucratic  terminology  and  service  regulations.  When  the  language  level  is  not  sufficient,  caseworkers  might  not  motivate  the  self-service  application,  but  rather  pre-fill the  paper  form  for  the  citizens  and  ask  them  to  sign  (CW2).  Terms  such  as  'ytelser' (benefits),  'bostłtte'  (housing  support),  and  'barnebidrag'  (child  support)  are  not  selfexplanatory  for  all  citizens,  and  misunderstandings  can  result  in  incorrect  applications. We  observed  that  some  citizens  rely  on  caseworkers  to  clarify  and  explain  these  terms, while  others  use  Google  Translate,  which  is  not  always  accurate  (S9).  Additionally,  certain  terms  or  phrases  that  have  a  specific  meaning  in  the  context  of  the  application  form were  perceived  as  hard  to  understand:

'I don't know what they mean by 'other expenses'. Maybe there are new expenses I haven't thought of, for example, shoes the kids suddenly need, or a new phone.' (C2).

In  addition  to  the  use  of  bureaucratic  terms,  the  language  used  in  the  application  form can  be  difficult  to  understand,  especially  for  citizens  who  don't  have  Norwegian  as  their first  language  or  those  applying  for  the  first  time.  We  observed  that  misunderstanding certain  terms  or  questions  can  lead  to  incorrect  answers,  which  later  need  to  be  corrected by  caseworkers.  Even  when  citizens  understand  the  question,  they  might  struggle  to formulate  an  answer.  One  citizen  points  out  that  it  would  be  much  easier  to  select  from a  pool  of  answers,  as  she  knows  why  she  is  applying  for  FA,  but  translating  and  writing it  in  a  different  language  takes  a  lot  of  time  (C5).

Beyond  language  challenges, regulatory knowledge gaps  hinder  citizens'  ability  to apply  for  the  correct  assistance.  Many  citizens  are  unaware  of  what  they  are  entitled  to, leading  to  missed  benefits.  One  citizen  described  how  they  only  learned  about  financial assistance  for  children's  leisure  activities  years  after  becoming  eligible.

'It went on for 3-4 years without me knowing that we could get support for this [freetime activity for children], then I talked to someone and got to know our rights' (C2).

The  caseworkers  confirm  these  observations,  stating  that  they frequently  need  to provide  extensive  guidance  on  the  regulations,  explaining  what  the  citizen  is  eligible  for or  the  reasoning  behind  decisions  (CW1,  CW3).

In  addition  to  lacking  knowledge  of  their  rights,  some  citizens  lack  understanding  of the  service  and  the  information  NA V  requires  to  process  the  application.  Some  citizens questioned  why  NAV  needs  certain  information  about  them  or  stated  that  NA V  should already  have  certain  information  about  them,  e.g.,  their  family  situation.

'You [NAV] know that my children go to kindergarten every month; why do I have to send the invoice every month?' (C2) .

## b. ICT  knowledge

The  guidance  sessions  and  interviews  showed  that  one  of  the  main  challenges  for citizens  is  to  collect  and  provide  documentation,  as  this  demands  them  to  interact  with other  digital  self-service  solutions  besides  NA V's  digital  application,  for  example,  their bank.  Caseworkers  explained  that  citizens  must  get  documents  from  several  places  (bank, tax  authority,  municipal  page,  electricity  provider,  etc.)  and  are  often  not  sure  how  to download  them  from  the  respective  portal  and  deliver  them  digitally.

'Bank statement. Many people struggle to download as a PDF and deliver it digitally, and it may happen that they come and meet up here and print it out and deliver it on paper' (CW1).

Citizens  can  provide  supplementary  documentation  and  information  through  a  designated  function  in  the  web  portal,  yet  the  guidance  sessions  and  interviews  showed  that this  function  is  difficult  to  find.  Thus,  some  citizens  send  a  new  application  instead.

'Because then they can't figure out how to submit it without applying. Or they can't find the attachment [function]. And in our experience, we quite often find that applications come in… And not just attachments, but if they need to explain something to us, they fill out an application to explain it. They don't have to apply; you can just explain it. We don't have any digital communication with them, so they use the digital application to communicate. Maybe it's to explain their situation. But they can actually send in an attachment or an explanation of an attachment.' (CW2).

One  citizen  explains  that  he  is  worried  about  making  a  mistake,  so  he  always  fills  in a  new  application  even  when  he  only  has  to  send  a  receipt  for  something  (C3).

## 4.2 Citizen-Held  Knowledge

We  find  that  the  knowledge  held  by  citizens  refers  to  both  a)  contextual  knowledge  that citizens  have,  and  b) practice knowledge gained  when  handling  the  digital  application. We  will  present  these  different  dimensions  of  citizen-held  knowledge  below.

## a. Contextual  knowledge

The contextual knowledge that citizens possess needs to be comprehensively transferred  to  caseworkers  to  be  able  to  handle  the  application.

'[…] the more information I have from them [the citizen], regardless of what kind of service I can offer, the easier it is for me as a caseworker because then I understand the situation. […] It's always a judgment call. You might have these standard laws or rules. […] But there's so much more to it than that. Leisure activities are not really covered, but we make an individual assessment, and sometimes, they get it covered by us. So, the more we know about the person, the easier it is for us to pick up on things because we have a lot of responsibility. If they're in debt, we're basically the ones who have to pick it up.' (CW3).

As  this  caseworker  tells  us,  FA  requires  individual  assessment  based  on  the  information  provided  by  the  citizens.  Many  citizens  have  complex  life  situations  that  are  not  easy to  explain  in  the  application  form.  We  observed  that  citizens  understand  the  question that  is  asked  in  the  application  form,  but  are  unsure  how  to  answer  it  because  of  their  life situation.  One  citizen  who  owes  rent  explained  that  ' …it can be difficult to describe a complex situation in the digital application form' (C6).  He  prefers  to  discuss  the  matter during  a  physical  meeting  with  his  caseworker.

## b. Practice  Knowledge

Through  repeated  use  of  the  application  form,  citizens  gain  knowledge  of  handling the  application  process.  Examples  of  this  are  the  use  of  Google  Translate  lens  for  translating  the  application  form  (S9)  or  logging  into  the  application  form  from  two  devices simultaneously  to  allow  for  documentation  to  be  uploaded  from  each  device  (S7).  We further  found  that  citizens  who  have  filled  out  the  application  many  times  may  know what  they  have  to  click  or  write,  but  when  asked  about  it,  they  cannot  explain  what  it means  (e.g.,  clicking  'yes'  on  'do  you  want  us  to  collect  your  tax  information  automatically?'  (S2).  This  shows  that  citizens  have  learned  to  complete  the  application  process without  fully  comprehending  it.

## 4.3 Knowledge-Sharing  and  Learning  in  Caseworker-Citizen  Interaction

We  find  that  knowledge-sharing  and  learning  unfold  as  citizens  and  caseworkers  interact during  the  guiding  sessions,  where  they  are  both  a)  learning  through  interaction  and together  b)  overcoming  knowledge-sharing  barriers.

## a. Learning  Through  Interaction

As  shown  above,  citizens  need  certain  knowledge  to  submit  the  digital  application form  successfully.  In  their  interaction  with  a  caseworker,  the  citizens  can  gain  knowledge to  understand  and  comprehend  the  application  form.

As  one  caseworker  puts  it, '[…] giving them logic and reason behind the questions, and they will understand. Only that creates mastery' (CW3).  One  possible  channel  that allows  caseworkers  to  give  logic  and  reason  is  physical  meetings.  Additionally,  these meetings  offer  opportunities  to  identify  the  challenges  citizens  experience  and  are  a  good way  to  build  a  better  relationship  with  the  citizens.  This  is  confirmed  by  citizens  who explain  that  it  is  important  to  have  good  guidance  in  the  beginning  to  become  self-serving and  feel  more  confident  when  applying  themselves  later  on  (C3,  C7).  As  caseworkers guide  citizens  through  the  digital  application  form,  they  can  explain  every  step  of  the application,  the  information  NA V  is  asking  for,  why  NA V  is  asking  for  it,  and  how  it connects  to  the  other  steps  in  the  application  (S3).  Caseworkers  motivate  citizens  to  fill in  the  application  as  independently  as  possible,  meaning  they  should  control  the  mouse and  keyboard,  with  the  caseworker  only  helping  when  questions  arise.  Yet,  caseworkers admit  that  time  pressure  and  citizens'  frustration  might  tempt  them  to  take  over  for  the citizen  rather  than  guide  (CW2,  CW3,  S3,  S4).

These  interactions  not  only  allow  caseworkers  to  guide  the  citizens  but  also  to  gain more  insights  into  the  citizens'  cases  and  life  situations.  Examples  range  from  discovering  unpaid  bills  (S4)  to  citizens  explaining  why  they  were  unable  to  pay  rent  (C6),

but  also  more  serious  problems  related  to  the  family  situation.  In  the  interview,  a  caseworker  tells  us  that  face-to-face  meetings  are  very  important  to  discover  such  issues  and explains  that 'the digital application might prevent that [we get a better impression of the citizen]. Because with the paper application, you had to come to us in person. […] and even if they don't say anything, again, someone might show some signs. And the digital world has perhaps made that path longer.' (CW3).

During  these  interactions,  caseworkers  learned  that  many  citizens  experience  the application  as  long  and  with  many  questions,  which  can  create  frustration  for  the  citizen (CW1,  CW2).

'When you work in NAV and with the system all the time, it's easy to think that everyone understands it, but it's a lot and very complex. When I went through the first application now, I had to stop a bit because there was so much at once. And it is for them too, but sometimes we think they understand just because we understand' (CW3).

At  the  same  time,  caseworkers  gain  understanding  and  insight  into  the  functioning of  the  digital  solution  as  they  guide  the  citizen.

'I don't know if it will come up at the end if he checks it off. He probably has to document something on it. Maybe at the end or something?' (CW2,  S6).

On  several  occasions,  caseworkers  were  unsure  how  a  specific  question  should  be answered  or  how  to  find  a  certain  document,  e.g.,  bank  statements  or  tax  declarations. When  citizens  and  caseworkers  are  unsure  how  to  answer  a  question,  they  often  discuss the  matter  and  solve  it  in  a  collaborative  process  (e.g.,  S5).

In  addition  to  learning  about  the  citizens'  perspective,  caseworkers  can  also  learn from  citizens  about  how  to  use  the  digital  application  form,  as  some  citizens  develop their  own  methods.  In  one  guidance  session,  the  citizen  logged  into  the  same  application from  the  PC  and  phone  to  upload  documentation  that  she  had  on  her  phone  without transferring  it  to  the  PC  first.  The  caseworker  was  not  aware  of  this  option  before,  but integrated  it  into  the  other  guidance  sessions  by  telling  other  citizens  to  try  the  same method.  (S7).

This  knowledge  helps  refine  how  they  support  citizens: 'It makes my job easier now that I know how to guide people tomorrow and the day after.' (CW3).

## b. Overcoming  Knowledge-Sharing  Barriers

Caseworkers  often  face  system  limitations  when  guiding  citizens,  especially  when interacting  through  the  phone.  They  describe  phone  guidance  as  challenging,  as  they cannot  see  what  the  citizen  is  actually  struggling  with  (there  is  no  screen-sharing  option available)  (CW1).  One  common  strategy  among  caseworkers  is  to  create  a  fictitious application  in  their  personal  NA V  account.

The  application  process,  especially  handling  documentation,  looks  different  on  a  PC or  smartphone,  which  causes  an  additional  barrier.

When  guiding  citizens  in  downloading  and  submitting  documentation,  caseworkers occasionally  log  in  to  their  personal  banking  apps  to  find  out  how  to  download  bank statements.  However,  as  each  bank  has  its  own  portal,  this  method  has  its  limitations.

Compared  to  face-to-face  guidance,  phone  guidance  gives  fewer  opportunities  to  explain the  whole  application  and  identify  other  areas  in  which  the  citizen  struggles.

To  summarize  our  findings,  knowledge-sharing  in  digital  self-service  is  a  two-way process.  Citizens  need  regulatory,  linguistic,  and  ICT  knowledge  to  navigate  the  system, while  caseworkers  require  contextual  knowledge  that  citizens  hold  about  their  financial situations.  Additionally,  caseworkers  gain  insights  into  citizens'  experiences  when  using the  digital  self-service  solution  in  collaboration.  During  the  sessions,  we  find  that  both citizens  and  caseworkers  learn  from  each  other's  practices  while  engaging  in  shared practices as they interact with self-service solutions and share  knowledge  about  the digital  application.

## 5 Discussion

Successful  digitalization  of  services  requires  a  deep  understanding  of  citizens'  practices  [13].  In  the  case  of  digital  FA  applications,  both  caseworkers  and  citizens  operate within  distinct  but  interconnected  practices.  Caseworkers  possess  domain  knowledge, i.e.,  administrative  and  regulatory  knowledge,  making  decisions  on  citizens'  eligibility for  support  while  citizens  navigate  digital  application  processes  to  access  these  services. Our  findings  show  how  direct  interaction  between  caseworkers  and  citizens  can  facilitate knowledge-sharing  across  these  practices  to  improve  service  delivery,  which  can  further benefit  both  citizens  and  caseworkers.

Our  findings  demonstrate  that  many  citizens  need  support  in  understanding  and  handling  the  digital  self-service  application  for  FA  and  that  knowledge  gaps  can  lead  to errors  and  additional  administrative  work  for  caseworkers.  These  findings  support  previous  research  [12,  18,  19].  For  instance,  service  complexity,  bureaucratic  terms,  and language  barriers  make  it  difficult for  citizens  to  understand  the  application  process, increasing  the  likelihood  of  incorrect  submissions  that  require  manual  correction.  Similarly,  regulatory  knowledge  gaps  and  challenges  related  to  ICT  skills,  e.g.,  document upload,  result  in  incomplete  digital  applications,  necessitating  follow-up  efforts  from caseworkers.  Caseworkers  become  knowledge  intermediaries,  playing  a  crucial  role  in bridging  the  gap  between  both  practices.  When  caseworkers  provide  guidance  on  how to  fill  out  application  forms  correctly,  they  help  reduce  application  errors  and  enhance citizens'  confidence  in  using  digital  self-services.  Without  adequate  guidance,  citizens must  navigate  the  system  independently,  increasing  the  learning  costs  associated  with self-service  technologies,  also  shown  by  [8,  10].

When  caseworkers  explain  bureaucratic  terms,  regulations,  and  eligibility  criteria, they  transfer  the  explicit  knowledge  of  their  own  practice  to  the  citizens.  While  previous literature  has  mainly  focused  on  supporting  citizens  in  gaining  relevant  knowledge  and skills  to  become  self-serving  [9,  28],  we  found  that  knowledge-sharing  is  not  unidirectional.  Through  repeated  interaction  with  the  self-service  solution,  citizens  develop  tacit knowledge  from  which  caseworkers  can  learn.  For  example,  some  citizen-developed strategies include using two devices for simultaneous  logins  and  document  uploads or  using  Google  Translate  Lens.  This  knowledge  has  been  transferred  and  adopted  by caseworkers  to  improve  and  facilitate  guidance.

Thus,  the  interaction  between  caseworkers  and  citizens  offers  an  opportunity  for caseworkers  to  learn  from  the  citizens'  practice  of  handling  the  self-service  application

and  improving  the  guidance  of  other  citizens.  This  shows  that  filing  self-service  applications  is  a  practice  in  which  one  can  develop'  professional'  knowledge.  Additionally, citizens  can  share  information  on  their  life  situation,  which  is  too  difficult  to  convey  in the  digital  application  form,  yet  highly  relevant  for  caseworkers'  case-handling  practice. This  represents  an  example  of  complexity  in  a  citizen's  life  situation  that  is  difficult  to capture  in  a  digital  application  and  can  be  eased  with  human  interaction  [6].

We  further  found  that  knowledge-sharing  can  be  constrained  by  the  lack  of  interactive  communication  features  such  as  screen  sharing  or  messaging,  especially  when  the interaction  is  not  face-to-face.  This  may  lead  to  misuse  of  the  application  form,  e.g., when  citizens  submit  entirely  new  applications  just  to  communicate  with  NA V .  At  the same  time,  these  constraints  lead  caseworkers  to  create  alternative  strategies,  such  as starting  a  fictive  application  to  support  knowledge-sharing.  Such  workaround  strategies or  'tinkering'  have  been  observed  in  other  research  as  well  [25].  This  underlines  the value  of  physical  meetings  for  more  comprehensive  knowledge-sharing,  as  they  allow caseworkers  and  citizens  to  make  sense  of  and  interact  with  the  self-service  solution together.

Relating  our  findings  to  Wenger's  perspective  of  knowledge-sharing,  we  can  interpret the  self-service  solution  for  financial  assistance  as  an  artifact  that  is  placed  between  two practices:  professional  case  handling  and  the  citizens'  digital  application  process.  As citizens  and  caseworkers  interact  with  and  through  the  self-service  system,  they  share knowledge,  produce  new  knowledge,  and  become  knowledgeable  in  the  other  practice [40].  We  further  extend  Wenger·s  theory  of  knowledge-sharing  to  the  digital  government domain.  We  find  that  different  knowledge  dimensions  are  tied  to  different  practices,  for example  1)  citizens  require  explicit  knowledge  to  manage  the  digital  application,  while also  holding  contextual  and  tacit  knowledge  that  can  be  transferred  to  caseworkers  (2) contextual  knowledge  transfer  can  be  hard  to  comprehend  in  written  format;  and  (3) knowledge-sharing  both  enables  and  improves  digital-self  service  delivery  by  mutual learning  and  overcoming  barriers.  This  has  implications  for  both  the  individual  and  the collective  level.

This study contributes to the literature on digital self-service, which  often has a reductionist view focusing on explicit knowledge  embedded  in  the digital solution. While  explicit  knowledge  is  primarily  transferred  from  caseworkers  to  citizens,  tacit knowledge  flows  bidirectionally.  However,  knowledge-sharing  barriers,  including  language  difficulties,  bureaucratic  complexity,  and  system  limitations,  can  hinder  the  use of  digital  self-service.  Personal  interaction,  where  these  barriers  become  visualized  and addressed,  for  example,  with  the  use  of  a  translator,  can  bridge  these  barriers.

Our  study  presents  implications  for  digital  service  delivery  by  challenging  the  striving  for  purely  'self'-service  delivery,  as  our  findings  point  to  the  value  of  knowledgesharing  between  caseworkers  and  citizens  in  direct  interaction,  to  benefit  both  citizens, caseworkers,  and  the  organization.  As  such,  knowledge-sharing  represents  a  valuable resource  for  organizations  seeking  to  improve  their  services,  as  the  knowledge  generated  can  be  used  in  service  development.  Further,  it  helps  to  gain  realistic  expectations on  what  digital  services  actually  offer  and  what  their  limitations  are.

Our  findings  further  emphasize  the  need  for  organizations  to  integrate  caseworkers' and  citizens'  insights  into  the  development  of  digital  service  delivery,  such  as  self-service

solutions.  By  leveraging  caseworkers'  insights,  public  organizations  can  reduce  learning costs  for  citizens  and  improve  the  overall  use  of  digital  self-service  solutions.  Additionally,  recognizing  caseworkers  as  knowledge  intermediaries  highlights  their  critical  role in  ensuring  equitable  access  to  digital  public  services.

## 6 Limitations  and  Future  Research

This  study  is  based  on  data  from  a  limited  number  of  citizens.  Additionally,  the  majority of  our  participants  were  immigrants,  of  whom  four  required  an  interpreter.  While  the use of an interpreter  enabled  us  to  include  these  citizens  in  the study, it also poses  a limitation  to  the  data  quality,  as  important  information  and  its  meanings  can  get  lost  in the  translation  process.  Therefore,  we  recommend  extending  this  study  to  other  groups to  better  understand  citizens  and  their  needs  when  applying  for  FA.

Future  studies  could  explore  how  the  knowledge  that  caseworkers  gain  through  interaction  with  citizens  can  be  further  transferred  within  the  organization  to  support  system design,  as  well  as  service  innovation.  Future  research  should  further  explore  how  informal  knowledge-sharing  networks  influence  self-service  adoption  and  whether  system design  improvements  can  reduce  citizens'  reliance  on  unofficial  support  mechanisms.

Abstract. This article explores how  disadvantaged women  experience  digital welfare  services  and  the  meanings  and  feelings  they  attribute  to  their  lived  experiences.  While  digital  welfare  is  a  reality  in  many  countries  worldwide,  few  studies focus  on  how  disadvantaged  citizens  experience  it  and  the  consequences  of  social services  digitalization,  especially  considering  a  gender  lens.  Women  are  usually the  default  reference  for  the  public  social  services  system  and  disproportionally face  the  weight  of  care  work  and  the  gender  digital  divide.  The  research  employed Interpretative  Phenomenological  Analysis  (IPA)  as  a  data  collection  and  analysis  method.  A  purposeful  sample  of  women  living  in  the  M'Boi  Mirim  outskirts region  in  Sªo  Paulo  City,  Brazil,  were  interviewed  in-depth.  Results  indicate  that ambivalent  feelings  and  experiences  are  influenced  by  age,  level  of  education,  and family  background.  Mostly,  out  of  necessity,  disadvantaged  women  find  their  way to  digital  social  services,  whether  experiencing  satisfaction  and  embracement  or feelings  of  anger,  frustration,  and  disempowerment,  which  all  come  together  to delineate  the  digital  government  they  hope  for.  The  research  contributes  to  both theory  and  practice  by  revealing  the  symbolic  and  concrete  implications  of  digital social  services  from  a  gender  perspective.

## 1 Introduction

Digital welfare  is now  a reality in many  parts  of the world,  as  technologies  such  as biometric  identification,  automated  decision-making,  and  even  simple  online  forms  have been  applied  to  various  social  welfare  policies  and  services,  whether  in  countries  with strong  welfare  traditions  or  not  [15].  This  reality  has  not  been  without  questioning  [4, 11],  one  of  the  reasons  being  that  welfare  policies  and  services  are  mostly  directed  at disadvantaged  people,  who  tend  to  coincide  with  the  digitally  excluded:  citizens  who lack  the  means  to  access  technology  properly,  to  varying  degrees  and  forms.

Research  on  digital  welfare  has  increased  considerably  over  the  last  five  years;  however,  some  crucial  spots  remain  under-investigated,  such  as  the  lived  experience  and

consequences  of  digital  government  on  citizens  [3,  20,  31],  and  specifically  on  women, viewed  through  a  gender  lens  [12].

Citizens  assume  new  roles  in  digital  government  as  their  form  of  interaction  with digital  public  services  has  undergone  a  dramatic  change,  with  new  responsibilities  and normative  expectations  being  placed  upon  them,  such  as  the  concept  of  the  self-serving citizen.  This  new  narrative  of  citizenship  forges  new  patterns  of  exclusion,  especially concerning  those  who  cannot  comply  with  the  new  environment,  creating  new  hierarchies between  citizens  or  second-order  citizens  [32],  also  emphasizing  the  need  to  understand more  deeply  the  consequences  of  these  developments  and  the  risk  of  adverse  effects, such  as  control  over  citizen  behavior  and  privacy  issues  [20].

Additionally,  citizens  have  been  treated  as  a  homogeneous  group  of  stakeholders  in e-government  research  or  as  small  groups  divided  by  demographic  characteristics  [8, 9].  However,  the  citizenry  consists  of  diverse  individuals  with  varied  needs,  expectations,  and  life  circumstances  [8],  and  therefore,  context,  life  conditions,  and  identities significantly  impact  how  digital  government  is  perceived  and  experienced.

Women  constitute  a  special  group  of  citizens  for  digital  welfare  research.  In  many cultures  around  the  globe,  women  are  primarily  responsible  for  government  interactions regarding  social  services,  as  culturally  reinforced  gender  roles  have  attributed  to  women the  weight  of  care  work,  such  as  being  mothers,  wives,  and  caregivers  of  family  members  [18,  28].  Through  norms,  policies,  and  other  instruments  such  as  digital  technology, governments  may  reinforce  gender  roles  and  exert  control  over  women's  bodies,  labor, and  gender  identities  [12,  16,  24].  Despite  this,  research  has  shown  that  digital  technologies  are  usually  designed  by  men,  having  a  generic  white  male  figure  in  mind  [12, 27].  This  scenario  adds  to  the  gender  digital  divide  [1,  21].  However,  women  are  not  a homogeneous  category  on  their  own,  and  differences  in  color/race,  class,  among  others, matter  [22].

This  article  contributes  to  addressing  this  gap  by  analyzing  the  experiences  of  different  disadvantaged  women  living  in  the  M'Boi  Mirim  outskirts  region  of  Sªo  Paulo City,  Brazil,  as  they  interact  with  digital  social  policies.  The  central  question  is:  How do  women  experience  the  digitalization  of  social  policies  and  services?  By  examining the  general  experiences  of  women  within  various  social  services,  the  consequences  and meaning-making  of  digital  welfare,  from  the  perspective  of  disadvantaged  women,  are revealed.

This  explorative  and  inductive  research  [30]  draws  on  interpretative  phenomenological  analysis  (IPA)  [33]  and  intersectionality  [34,  35]  to  unveil  the  experiences  of disadvantaged  women  who  rely  on  welfare  services  that  have  now,  to  varying  degrees, gone  digital.

While  not  accounting  for  generalizable  results,  exploring  women's  experiences  is  a valuable  approach  that  brings  relevant  insights  to  advance  in  understanding  the  consequences  of  digital  welfare  from  a  gender  perspective:  how  it  affects  their  sense  of  citizenship,  how  they  navigate  these  new  roles  attributed  to  them  by  governments,  what  are  the phycological  effects  on  them,  and  especially  how  these  experiences  add  to  their  intersectional  identities,  reinforcing  or  easing  patterns  of  oppression  and  exclusion  to  different women.  Research  from  this  perspective  is  crucial  to  ensure  that  digital  governments  and welfare  systems  are  creating  a  better  world  for  all  [36].

The  following  section  presents  the  literature  background  that  motivated  the  research, informed the inductive research design, and provided a repertoire for interpreting women's  experiences.  Next,  the  study  site  and  IPA  methodology  are  presented.  Results are  structured  in  the  form  of  four  group  experiential  statements  (GETs)  that  emerged  in the  IPA  inductive  analysis.  Finally,  the  discussion  and  final  considerations  are  presented.

## 2 Gender, (Digital) Welfare and Intersectionality

Women  constitute  a  distinct  and  diverse  group  of  citizens  central  to  welfare  policies and  services,  given  the  significant  reliance  of  welfare  systems  on  women's  unpaid  care labor.  Lewis  [18]  was  the  first  author  to  discuss  gender  and  welfare  regimes  and  one of  the  most  bruising  voices  in  criticizing  Esping-Andersen's  [10]  threefold  typology  of welfare  states.  She  argued  that  any  concept  of  welfare  should  consider  unpaid  work  as well,  not  just  paid  work  and  the  male-breadwinner  family  model,  thereby  problematizing the  dependent  status  that  women  have  historically  assumed  in  many  cultures  as  wives, mothers, and caregivers. Due  to caregiver responsibilities,  women  often  assume  the majority  of  interactions  with  public  services  for  family  members,  such  as  scheduling health  appointments,  applying  for  and  navigating  the  conditionalities  of  social  benefits, and  managing  school  enrollment  and  attendance,  despite  their  increasing  participation in  the  paid  labor  market  and  their  roles  as  heads  of  households.

In  fact,  through  its  policies,  norms,  and  instruments,  states  can  reinforce  and  influence how  women  are  perceived,  what  behaviors  are  expected,  and  which  are  not  allowed. Mello  &amp;  Marques  [24]  propose  a  model  highlighting  four  ways  in  which  states  consider women  in  the  design  and  implementation  of  public  policies:  i)  a  reproductive  vision,  in which  women  are  seen  primarily  as  mothers  and  caregivers;  ii)  a  productive  vision,  in which  women  are  seen  as  labors  in  a  paid  labor  market,  iii)  a  reactive  vision,  including women  lately  on  public  policies  and  iv)  an  inclusive  vision,  with  women  as  focus  of public  policies.

Herd  and  Moynihan  [16]  highlight  how  administrative  burdens  are  gendered  and function  to  control  and  regulate  bodies,  labor,  and  gendered  identities  that  are  mainly applied  to  poor  and  racially  marginalized  groups  of  women,  making  the  case  for  a  feminist  approach  to  public  administration  scholarship.  The  authors  identified  four  mechanisms  through  which  gendered  burdens  generate  inequalities:  i)  regulating  reproductive health  care,  ii)  requiring  reproductive  labor,  iii)  restricting  reproductive  labor,  such  as limiting or impeding  the  right to  provide care labor with dignity, and iv) regulating gendered  identities  that  reinforce  heteronormative  and  cisnormativity  constructions  of gender.

Similarly, calling attention to the role of gender  in  technology  design,  adoption, implementation,  and  use, Feeney  &amp;  Fusi [12] argue for the need to critically study gender  and  technology  in  government,  noting  how  feminist  theory  is  rarely  applied  to the  field,  despite  the  commitment  of  most  Western  governments  to  gender  equity.

Women,  however,  are  not  a  unified  category  as  well.  Understanding  the  gendered experiences of e-government interaction requires considering other factors as they intersect  with  experiences  of  inequality  and  oppression.

Intersectionality  is  concerned  with  understanding  the  complex  dimensions  of  systems of  oppression  and  power  relations  imbricated  with  overlapping  social  identities,  such  as

gender,  race,  class,  sexuality,  and  other  identities  and  social  positions  [34,  35].  Kimberly Crenshaw  [7],  the  first  author  to  explicitly  adopt  the  term  'intersectionality,'  used  the metaphor  of  a  crossroad,  where  different  factors  flow,  configuring  unique  individual  or group  subjectivities  and  experiences  of  oppression,  power,  or  subordination,  to  address the  racialized  experiences  of  women  in  the  United  States.

Intersectionality  considers  how  the  heterogeneity  that  emerges  from  different  intersections  affects  the  understanding  of  social  experiences.  These  social  positions  cannot be  analyzed  separately;  they  shape  social  experience  together  [6].  Intersectional  research faces  the  challenge  of  ' capturing  the  simultaneous  interrelations  between  the  subjective and  the  structural ' [34]  to  tackle  inequalities.  It  relies  on  lived  experience  as  a  criterion of  meaning,  considering  the  analysis  of  more  than  one  category  of  difference  and  the interaction  between  the  individual  and  institutional  levels  in  a  multilevel  approach.

## 3 Research Approach

## 3.1 Study Site

M'Boi  Mirim  is  a  zone  located  on  the  outskirts  of  Sªo  Paulo,  with  approximately  600,000 people  living  in  urbanized  areas,  favelas,  and  areas  with  rural  characteristics.  According to  one  of  the  research  participants,  telecom  companies  arrived  in  the  area  only  about  six years  ago,  and  it  has  one  of  the  worst  concentrations  of  mobile  internet  access,  measured by antennas  per area  (km 2 ) [29]. Figuring  as a zone  with  some  of  the lowest  social scores  on  the  Sªo  Paulo  City  Inequalities  Map  2024  [29],  one  of  its  neighborhoods, Jardim  ´ngela,  was  considered  by  the  United  Nations  the  most  violent place in the world  during  the  90  s,  with  a  murdering  rate  of  116,23  per  100  thousand  inhabitants in  1996.  The  history  of  violence  motivated  the  uprise  of  many  social  movements  in the  region,  driven  by  the  catholic  church  in  partnership  with  civil  society.  After  years of researchers  coming  to  study  the area, they  engendered  the  creation  of  the  M'Boi Urban  Research  Station.  Holding  the  philosophy  of  ' nothing  about  us,  without  us ,'  they welcome  research  in  the  area,  asking  researchers  to  engage  with  the  community  in  the return  of  results.

## 3.2 Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA)

The  qualitative  and  inductive  research  design  [30]  followed  Interpretative  Phenomenological  Analysis  (IPA)  [33].  Derived  from  psychology,  IPA  is  committed  to  revealing life experiences  as lived by subjects and interpreted by the researcher. It is  focused ' on  personal  meaning  and  sense-making  in  a  particular  context,  of  people  who  share a  particular  experience ' [33,  p.  39].  Informed  by  phenomenology,  hermeneutics,  and idiography,  IPA  can  be  considered  a  process  of  double  hermeneutics.  First,  the  researcher attempts  to  make  sense  ' of  the  making  sense  of  the  participant ,'  looking  at  things  as  they appear  to  be  to  the  individual,  as  in  idiography.  In  this  sense,  each  participant  is  a  case. Later,  the  researcher  attempts  to  ask  questions  and  interpret  the  experiences,  moving  to more  general  claims  about  the  experience,  noting  that  ' the  specifics  are  unique,  but  they are  hung  on  what  is  shared  and  communal ' [33,  p.  32].

## 3.3 Sample and Data Collection

The  sample  was  purposively  selected  [26],  considering  IPA  and  an  intersectional  lens. Seven  women  living  in  M'Boi  Mirim,  mostly  black/brown  women  living  with  up  to one  minimum  wage  per  month  per  household  (U$  260),  were  chosen.  Despite  these commonalities,  they  were  also  selected  due  to  other  markers  of  difference,  such  as  age, educational  level,  family  configuration,  disability,  and  sources  of  income.  Participants are  described  in  Table  1.  Names  have  been  aleatory  attributed  by  ChatGPT  to  preserve anonymity.

| Participant name   | Age   | Educational level   | Primary source of income      |
|--------------------|-------|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| Sofia              | 60+   | Elementary          | Retirement (INSS)             |
| Valentina          | 60+   | Elementary          | Retirement (INSS)             |
| Gabriela           | 41-50 | Secondary           | Disability benefit (BPC/INSS) |
| Larissa            | 31-40 | Secondary           | Bolsa Família                 |
| Helena             | 31-40 | Secondary           | Employment contract           |
| Camila             | 21-30 | Tertiary            | Work contract                 |
| Juliana            | 21-30 | Tertiary            | Disability benefit (BPC/INSS) |

After  obtaining  ethics  approval,  data  were  collected  through  in-depth  and  in-person interviews  of  approximately  50  min  each  to  gain  insight  into  participants'  accounts  of experiences  interacting  with  various  digital social  services,  prompting  them  to  share their  thoughts,  feelings,  and  meaning-making  processes  in  as  much  detail  as  possible. The  decision  not  to  focus  on  one  single  digital  social  service  was  intentional.  It  allowed for  a  broader  view  of  digital  welfare  as  a  sum  of  different  government  policies,  services, and  levels.  A  research  assistant  from  the  community  helped  identify  the  participants, invited  and  scheduled  the  interviews,  and  participated  in  some  of  them  as  an  observer. Interviews conducted  by  the author took place between  June  and  August  2024  in a church's  dependencies.  They  were  recorded  and  subsequently  transcribed.  During  the interviews,  some  participants  spontaneously  showed  the  interviewer  an  app  or  website on  their  smartphones  to  illustrate  their  answers.

## 3.4 Data Analysis

The  data analysis followed  IPA  principles, summarized  in  7  steps [33],  which  were implemented  as  follows: (i) The first case (interview) was adapted to a template in Microsoft  Word  containing  three  columns  -  experiential  statements,  original  transcript, and  exploratory  notes.  The  original  interview  was  placed  in  the  second  column  and  read and  re-read.  Second,  (ii)  exploratory  notes  on  the  case  were  written  in  the  third  column. Third, iii)  in  the  first  column,  experiential  statements  were  constructed  based  on  the process  of making  sense  of  what  happened  to  that particular participant. Fourth, iv)

connections  across  experiential  statements  were  searched  to  group  them  under  personal experiential themes  (PET).  Following,  v) the emerging  PETs  for  the particular case were  named  and  consolidated  in  tables  using  Miro  online  software.  After  that,  vi)  the analysis  of  the  other  six  individual  cases  followed  the  same  steps.  Finally,  vii)  after  all the  cases  had  gone  through  the  same  individual  process,  the  PETs  that  emerged  for  each participant  were  analyzed  together  to  develop  group  experiential  themes  (GET)  across cases.  The  GETs  were  also  consolidated  using  Miro.  Regarding  intersectionality,  rather than  selecting  a  few  predetermined  categories  of  difference  to  focus  on,  identities  were left  to  emerge  during  the  research  and  analysis.

## 4 Results

The  analysis  revealed  four  group  experiential  statements  (GETs)  that  account  for  participants'  experiences  with  digitizing  social  policies  and  services,  binding  individual experiences  together.  They  are  explored  in  the  following  subsections.

## 4.1 Statement 1: Women Found Their Way to Digital Social Services Somehow

A  central  aspect  of  digital  government  use  is  having  quality  access  to  the  internet  and devices,  as  well  as  literacy  to  interact  with  technology.  Among  the  participants,  they somehow  managed  to  access  the  internet  and  digital  social  services.  All  the  interviewees in  the  research  are  users  of  digital  welfare  policies,  whether  directly  or  indirectly,  by relying  on  an  intermediary,  as  many  services  are  now  mandatorily  online,  leaving  no other  alternative.  Table  2  provides  a  brief  description  of  the  main  services  mentioned  by participants  during  the  interviews.

However,  although  most  consider  access  enough  for  the  type  of  use  they  perceive  as needed,  access  cannot  be  regarded  as  meaningful  [5].  Women  face  limitations  and  difficulties,  from  difficulty  acquiring  a  connection  to  unstable  signals  and  limited  memory space  on  devices.  Juliana  and  Camila  habitually  delete  governmental  apps  from  their devices  after  use,  as  they  don't  have  enough  memory  space  to  keep  them.  Gabriela,  a single  mother  of  a  child  with  a  cognitive  disability,  relies  on  neighbors  or  solidarity  of local  internet  providers  to  be  able  to  have  a  fixed  internet  connection  at  home,  as  she cannot  afford  either  fixed  or  postpaid  4G:

'…  money  is  not  enough  to  pay  for  the  internet  …there  is  no  money  left  over  for anything  ...  but  everywhere  I  go,  there  is  a  neighbor  who  allows  me  to  use  [their wifi]… '  (Gabriela)

From  the  perspective  of  autonomous  use,  whether  digitally  excluded  women  managed  to  access  digital  social  services  through  the  help  of  intermediaries,  this  happened with psychological  consequences,  as  there  is  a  bitter feeling of not being  able to do things  by  oneself  anymore:

' I  feel  terrible  …  because  you  go  in  one  place,  you  can't  do  it  [access  service], you  go  in  another  [the  same  happens]…,  because  this  …  had  to  be  released  for the  elderly  to  be  able  to  get  things  [social  benefits] '  (Sofia)

## 4.2 Statement 2: Ambivalent Experiences Shaped by Identities

Participants'  experiences  with  digital  welfare  are  ambivalent.  On  the  positive  pole,  terms such  as  satisfaction,  being  taken  care  of,  and  support  describe  the  feelings  associated with  digital  social  policies.  Terrible,  complex,  impossible,  and  bureaucratic  are  words employed  to  describe  the  experience  on  the  negative  pole.  Frequently,  both  feelings  are present  in  the  reasoning  of  the  same  participant,  reinforcing  the  ambivalence  of  digital

welfare  in  the  experiences  of  women  in  M'Boi  Mirim.  Larissa's  experience  with  digital welfare  symbolizes  the  middle  of  this  spectrum:

' At  the  same  time  that  they  help,  at  the  same  time  they  drive  us  crazy,  like,  I  think it's  half,  half,  because  yes,  it  helps  a  lot,  but  also  when  there  is  a  problem,  to  solve it  is  even  more  a  hell  of  a  bureaucracy '  (Larissa)

Despite  the  homogeneous  group  of  women  interviewed  regarding  gender  identity, class,  color/race,  and  geographical  region,  different  experiences  were  shaped  mainly  by markers  of  difference  such  as  age,  level  of  education,  and  family  configuration.  The design of digital social services also played a role.  Sub-statements  presented  below explore  these  aspects.

Digital Welfare as a Form of Disablement and Loss of Autonomy. Aged  women with  low  levels  of  education  were  mostly  digitally  excluded,  and  this  exclusion  was  felt deeper  when  there  was  no  member  of  the  family  to  help,  as  it  is  for  Sofia,  who  lives  by herself.

' I  don't  know  how  to  use  it  because  I  have  little  education,  and  I  don't  know  how to  use  anything,  not  an  app,  nor  the  internet,  anything...  I  only  know  how  to  use this  [showing  WhatsApp  on  her  phone];  my  phone  must  have  internet,  but  I  don't know  … '  (Sofia)

This  feeling  of  not  being  capable  is  related  to  a  common  fear  of  doing  something irreversibly  wrong  or  falling  into  a  scam  with  severe  consequences,  such  as  losing  their money.  Valentina  exemplifies  this  concern  by  showing  during  the  interview  a  message she  had  just  received  from  an  unknown  person  offering  her  consigned  credit.

These  women  rely  primarily  on  others  to  use  the  internet  and  access  social  digital services.  However,  the  use  by  proxy  [14]  is  problematic  as  it  subjects  them  to  the  availability  and  goodwill  of  intermediaries,  such  as  family  or  community  members,  bonds that  may  be  hard  to  substitute  in  their  absence.

'…  I  can't;  I  need  someone's  help;  it's  so  that  if  one  day  I  move  away  from  here or  Beth  [church  volunteer  who  helps  her]  leaves  here,  I  don't  know  what  to  do ' (Sofia)

When  there  is  no  volunteer  to  help,  it  is  necessary  to  resort  to  a  paid  intermediary  or, if  it  is  a  matter  of  public  service,  visit  a  Descomplica  unit  in  Sªo  Paulo,  which  is  a  service center  to  assist  citizens  with  technology,  among  other  services.  Sofia,  for  example,  pays an  internet  cafe  every  month  to  print  her  telecom  bill,  which  she  no  longer  receives  on paper,  at  her  address.

Intermediation  of  digital  services  also  increases  the  exposure  of  personal  data  and risk,  as  women  may  not  always  be  aware  of  what  others  are  doing  in  their  names.  In  this scenario,  trust  in  other  people  stands  out  as  a  fundamental  element:

' I  don't  do  it  ...  They  [sons]  do  it  ...  sometimes  he  [referring  to  one  of  her  sons] looks  at  my  salary,  ...  manages  my  retirement  … '  (Valentina)

However,  satisfaction  with  using  digital  technology  through  intermediaries  differs among  them.  Sofia,  for  example,  was  very  unsatisfied  as  digitalization  undermined  her autonomy  to  solve  her  problems  independently  and  to  interact  with  government  bodies and  private  companies.  This  dependence  is  frustrating  for  her,  while  Valentina,  even  if  it represents  a  loss  of  autonomy,  prefers  someone  to  do  whatever  she  needs  so  she  doesn't have  to  go  to  public  offices  in  person.

' ...  I'd  rather  he  [son]  makes  it  [appointment  with  the  doctor  using  the  Agenda Fácil  app];  I'm  already  tired,  with  my  old  legs  and  climbing  all  this  …  [reference to the slope near  her house  and  how  it would  be  difficult to  walk  through  it] ' (Valentina)

Not  being  able  to  use  it  directly,  feeling  disempowered,  or  losing  autonomy  seem  to contribute  to  making  transformative  good  digital  changes  underperceived  or  undervalued by  some  participants.  Valentina  says,  ' …  for  me,  not  much  has  changed ,' as  her  son does  everything  she  needs.  Even  when  participants  are  aware  of  significant  changes, improvements  may  be  unperceived  or  undervalued,  as  in  the  case  of  Sofia.

Annually,  retired individuals  were  required  to provide  proof  of life at a  physical INSS  agency;  however,  this  process  is  now  fully  automated  in  most  cases  through  the cross-referencing  of  databases.  While  Sofia  is  aware  that  she  no  longer  has  to  provide proof  of  life,  she  doesn't  seem  to  recognize  it  as  a  positive  experience;  for  her,  digital welfare  has  brought  only  frustrating  and  disempowering  feelings  rather  than  positive changes.

Digital Welfare as a Means of Empowerment and Fulfilling Citizenship. The  more young  women  interviewed  represent  another  facet  of  experience  dealing  with  the  digital world.  With  varying  degrees,  they  are  all  direct  users  of  digital  social  policies  and  other digital  technologies,  such  as  digital  private  banks,  music  apps,  online  classes,  streaming services,  and  social  networks.  Feeling  secure,  taken  care  of,  and  welcomed  are  frequently mentioned  in  these  cases,  as  exemplified  by  Camila,  who  works  online  from  home  and is  a  mother  to  a  young  child.

' I  feel  very  graced,  let's  put  it  this  way  …  it's  free,  it's  public,  and  it  works!  These are  three  things  you  usually  can't  fit  in  the  same  sentence  … '  (Camila)

Juliana,  a  young  woman  with  a  physical  disability,  explained  her  contact  with  digital social  policies  had  mainly  to  do  with  circumstances  that  forced  her  to  go  digital.  However, she  felt  a  sense  of  empowerment  from  using  it  and  perceived  digital  public  services  as an  opportunity  to  save  time  and  reduce  her  commuting.

Digital Welfare as Fight, Anxiety, and Humiliation. Sometimes,  the  experience  is also  described  as  frustrating,  terrible,  and  impossible,  fostering  feelings  of  exclusion  and anxiety.  The  digitalization  of  CRAS  appointment  scheduling  is  a  prominent  example,  and it  is  unanimously  described  as  challenging  and  almost  impossible  by  all  the  interviewees who  needed  it.

CRAS,  along  with  the  INSS,  is  one of Brazil's  most  important  social  protection units.  While  the  INSS  is  responsible  for  retirement,  pensions,  unemployment  security, and  payment  of  BPC  for  people  with  disabilities,  among  others,  the  CRAS  is  accountable

for  the  reception  of  all  other  social  needs,  including  non-contributory  assistance  such as  the  Bolsa  Família,  the  national  conditional  cash  transfer  program  for  people  leaving  in  poverty  or  extreme  poverty.  Similarly,  the  Unified  Registry  for  Social  Programs (CadÚnico)  is  the  most  critical  registration  that  citizens  entitled  to  social  benefits  and cash  transfers  must  fill  in  to  be  eligible  to  access  them,  such  as  the  milk  benefit  (Leve Leite).  The  CRAS  are  the  units  responsible  for  filling  in  these  registries.

The  change  in  CRAS  scheduling  in  the  city  of  Sªo  Paulo  is  emblematic  for  most participants,  as  its  digitalization,  transitioning  from  in-person  to  online  (or  telephone) scheduling,  became  a  gatekeeper  to  the  service.  Although  there  are  many  CRAS  offices around the city, they now  refuse face-to-face contact unless it has been previously scheduled  virtually.  Camila  explains  her  frustration  very  clearly.

- ' …  I  get  very  upset  because  it's  a  service  that  we  are  entitled  to,  that  is  not  difficult to  have  physical  access,  but  what  makes  it  impossible  for  us  to  have  physical  access is  the  digital  … '  (Camila)

Updating  CadÚnico,  in  this  scenario,  became  a  source  of  anxiety,  as  it  depends  on the  online  scheduling  of  CRAS.  Keeping  the  CadÚnico  updated,  including  children's school  attendance  and  vaccination  information,  is  a  major  concern  for  women  who  rely more  deeply  on  social  benefits,  as  the  expiration  or  outdated  information  implies  the suspension  of  their  provision.

- '…  That's  what  they  say,  it  doesn't  block,  ...  but  if  you  stay  for  two  months  without updating  the  registration  ...  they  block  it '  (Gabriela)

Larissa  seems  to  suggest  that it would  be  better if  she  could  complete  the  entire process  of  CadÚnico  actualization  online,  as  scheduling  an  appointment  at  CRAS  is almost  impossible,  showing  a  propensity  to  deeper  digitalization.

- ' ...  you  have  to  re-register  for  Bolsa  Família,  to  update,  [and]  it's  a  sacrifice  ...  to schedule  because  you  don't  do  any  of  this  over  the  internet,  we  can  only  schedule [the  service],  so  for  you  to  schedule  it  is  a  damn  bureaucracy  because  as  much as  they  have  vacancies,  they  don't  release  them,  so  you  have  to  stay  there 24  h watching  to  see  if  a  spot  is  released  ... '  (Larissa)

For all that, attempts to schedule are described by participants as a struggle, as something  you  have  to  fight  for.

- ' …  They  say  that  there  is  no  more  vacancy,  that  it  has  already  been  completed, and  you  are  in  this  agony,  see,  it's  terrible...  You  keep  fighting;  some  people  get up  at  dawn  to  call  to  see  if  they  can  schedule  it '  (Sofia)

It  looks  like  the  traditional  daybreak  queues  in  many  public  services  in  Brazil,  a  symbol  of  precariousness,  have  been  removed  to  people's  homes,  where  they  can  struggle alone,  hidden  from  public  scrutiny,  eliminating  pressure  from  public  service  to  the  individuals  who  need  to  deal  by  themselves  with  an  internet  connection,  devices,  and  virtual public  encounters.  Humiliation  and  begging  are  words  that  appear  in  some  interviews when  the  CRAS  in  Sªo  Paulo  city  is  mentioned.

' …  I  cried  inside  the  CRAS  …  I  cried  like  a  child  there,  begging,  and  they  said  I couldn't,  that  I  should  …  go  home  and  call  [to  schedule  an  appointment] '  (Sofia)

In  the  case  of  CRAS  scheduling,  digitalization  promoted  an  inversion  where  entitled citizens,  such  as  disadvantaged  mothers  and  retired  women,  must  beg  for  something  that the  government  should  assure.

Digital Welfare as Both Information Empowerment and Disempowerment. Access to information  is another theme  frequently  mentioned  by  participants, and it is also mentioned  in  an  ambivalent  way.  On  the  one  hand,  the  possibility  of  checking  information independently  empowers  women,  allowing  them  to  be  more  aware  of  important  data  and avoid  waiting  in  line  at  a  public  agency.  One  of  the  participants,  for  instance,  could  see in  the  app  that  the  attendant  had  incorrectly  filed  the  date  of  birth  of  one  of  her  children, so  she  took  action  to  correct  it  before  incurring  any  loss  in  benefits.

Trust  in  information  is  another  issue.  Even  when  information  is  available  online, many  participants  still  rely  on  offline  interactions  to  verify  the  accuracy  and  reliability of  the  app  information.  More  information  is  readily  available,  saving  commuting  time, but  distrust  persists,  prompting  people  to  continue  going  to  offices  anyway.

Juliana:  ' It  was  easier  because  we  had  most  of  the  information  we  wanted  to  know there  [in  the  app]  …  You  didn't  have  to  leave  the  house,  right?  To  the  bank  ... '

Interviewer:  ' But  did  she  [her  mother]  go  to  the  bank  afterward?

'

Juliana:  ' Yes,  it's  because  she  still  had  doubts,  right?  Then,  she  wanted  to  be  sure if  that  was  the  case  ... '

On the other hand, they wish to have more detailed information, especially concerning  benefits  cuts  or  reductions  in  the  amounts.

' No,  there's  no  explanation;  it  doesn't  show;  if  it  gets  blocked  or  canceled,  they don't  give  you  justification,  then,  if  you  go  up  to  CRAS,  you  don't  solve  it  there either,  they  don't  give  you  any  information  …  They  don't  have  it,  …  or  I  don't know  why  [they  don't  give  the  information],  because  I  don't  understand  either ' (Larissa)

Offline  service,  however,  seems  worse  than  ever  in  the  participants'  speech,  as  they feel  that  frontline  workers  are  not  prepared  to  act  under  the  new  digital  logic.

' Sometimes  you  go  looking  for  information  about  something,  that  person  doesn't even  know  what  we're  talking  about…  you  see  people  that  aren't  ready  to  be  in the  place  yet,  but  who  are  there  anyway,  but  without  knowing  anything,  then  … you  feel  horrible;  I  think  that's  what  is  missing,  it's  a  lot  of  training  ... '  (Larissa)

In  a  scenario  where  information  is  insufficient  and  frontline  workers  are  untrained, inconsistencies  and  malfunctions  become  very  difficult  to  resolve,  generating  new  opacities  in  service  delivery  and  requiring  people  to  embark  on  a  journey  in  search  of  solutions. Gabriela,  for  instance,  whose  child  was  entitled  to  the  milk  benefit,  wasn't  receiving  it. She  took  more  than  nine  months,  peregrinating  with  her  child  from  one  public  agency to  another,  with  no  one  being  able  to  resolve  the  issue,  before  finally  discovering  that

her  file  had  never  been  updated  in  the  system,  a  task  that  school  frontline  workers  were supposed  to  handle.

## 4.3 Statement 3: Reinforcement of Gender Roles and Burdens

Maternity  constantly  appears  as  an  identity  that  drives  the  use  of  digital  government,  as  it obliges  disadvantaged  mothers,  who  are  usually  the  default  reference  for  social  services in  Brazil,  to  navigate  various  governmental  apps  from  different  levels  of  government and  for  children  of  different  ages.

' If  it's  related  to  my  child,  it's  always  me….  He  [partner]  …  executes  …  but  for that  to  happen,  I  must  pull  my  strings  and  manage,…  see  what  is  needed,  what documentation  needs  to  be  taken '  (Camila)

In  this  sense,  being  the  reference  for  the  children  sums  up  the  burden  of  reproductive and  care labor.  Larissa,  responsible  for  five  children,  expresses  the  physical  and emotional  distress  provoked  by  maternity  and  unpaid  care  labor.

' …  today  here  I  am,  having  to  take  care  of  the  house,  freaking  out  …  Being  a mother  is  not  easy  for  anyone;  …  we  get  tired  physically  and  emotionally,  we  get exhausted,  and  there  comes  the  point  where  you  don't  even  know  who  you  are anymore '  (Larissa)

Larissa,  who  used  to  take  the  night  shift  at  work  to  care  for  the  children  and  house during  the  day,  had  to  quit  after  the  grandchild  of  her  teenage  child  was  born.  Frustration with  giving  up  her  plans  sums  up  to  the  disproportionate  care  work  placed  on  her  shoulders.  In  this  scenario,  an  app  that  doesn't  work  correctly  or  the  difficulty  of  scheduling  an appointment  for  any  family  member  also  increases  the  feeling  of  being  ' slowed  down ,' not  because  she  doesn't  want  to  solve  it  but  because  technology  sometimes  makes  it more  difficult,  as  she  explains.

Challenges  in  dealing  with  digital  social  services  seem  like  one  more  fight  in  a  life already  full  of  responsibilities  that  disproportionally  weigh  over  women.  On  the  other hand,  a  service  that  is  easy  to  access  is  considered  a  success.

' …  [a  digital  service  that  is  difficult  to  perform]  is  one  more  fight  for  your  day, for  your  life,  for  your  year ,…  the  facilitated  is  a  victory  …  because  during  our  life, especially  when  we  have  children,  our  responsibility  is  never  the  same  as  a  man's, never,  no  matter  how  much  the  man  does… '  (Camila)

Larissa's  experience  with  the  School  Kit  Duepay  is  a  good  illustration.  After  general critics  that  school  supplies  and  uniforms  delivered  by  the  city  hall  to  each  student  on the  first  day  of  classes  were  of  low  quality  and  concentrated  on  a  few  providers,  the municipal  government  decided  to  change  the  system  and  created  the  Duepay  app,  where families  now  receive  an  amount  of  money  and  can  freely  choose  the  shop  where  to  buy  it, as  well  as  choose  the  school  supplies  of  their  preference.  The  experience  was  acclaimed for  contributing  to  the  decentralization  of  public  expenditure,  benefiting  many  small entrepreneurs  throughout  the  city.  At  the  same  time,  citizens  were  given  more  autonomy

to choose  their supplies. Larissa recognizes  that the app is easy to use and that the materials  are  improved,  with  higher-quality  shirts  and  trousers,  but  she  would  prefer  the old  way,  as  she  now  has  even  more  work  to  do.

' On  the  one  hand,  it  is  good,  but  I  don't  see  a  difference  from  when  they  used to  give  the  material  at  school;  the  difference  now  …  they  gave  [me]  more  work because  many  times  when  you  can't  get  access,  you  have  to  be  like  calling  the school  to  try  to  find  out  why,  …  and  many  times  the  school  is  not  always  willing …  to  help  you '  (Larissa)

Some  of  the  women  mentioned  that  they  now  work  from  home,  utilizing  digital technologies  and  the  internet  to  learn  new  skills  and  start  new  businesses  in  pursuit  of autonomy  and  financial  prosperity.  While  this  opportunity  is  celebrated  by  them,  on  the other  hand,  it  also  emerges  as  a  way  to  reconcile  working  life  with  care  labor  and  rarely turns  into  free  time  for  themselves.

' After  the  pandemic,  we  found  it  very  good,  facilitated  …  to  stay  at  home,  to  have free  time,  but  after  a  while,  free  time  stops  being  your  free  time,  it  becomes  a  free time  of  the  home… '  (Camila)

## 4.4 Statement 4: An Evolving and Fragmented Experience

Between  feelings  of  anger  and  frustration  on  one  side  and  feelings  of  joy  and  care  on  the other,  the  use  of  services  over  the  years  implies  gaining  experience,  defining  preferences, and  watching  the  service  evolve.  Many  participants  reported  that  apps  developed  over the  years  have  become  better  designed  and  easier  to  navigate.  They  also  mentioned  apps that  they  prefer  over  others.  Helena,  for  instance,  described  her  lousy  experience  when she  created  an  account  at  Gov.br  and  the  sound  experience  of  accessing  it  recently.

' …  creating  an  account  [on  Gov.br]  was  very  bureaucratic,  wow,  it  took  too  long, the  confirmation  email  didn't  arrive,…  lasted  a  month  so  that  I  could  have  access… It  was  a  struggle,  a  horrible  experience  that  we  had…  But,  for  example,  today  I tried  [and]…  it  was  very  fast '  (Helena)

Inconsistencies  between  different  service  channels  do  not  go  unnoticed  by  participants  either.  Commenting  on  the  online  and  telephone  scheduling  (through  the  156 number,  the  city  hall  call  center)  of  CRAS  appointment,  Gabriela  notes:

' …  on  156,  you  never  get  it;  it's  easier  for  you  to  try  at  dawn  through  the  website so  you  find,  then  I  say:…  why  do  we  call  156  there  is  no  vacancy,  we  enter  at  night [in  the  website],  and  the  vacancies  appear,  at  dawn?' (Gabriela)

Among different  public  services  and  agencies,  the  lack  of  interoperability  and  varying paces of digitalization  combine  to  provide  fragmented  user  experiences.  Juliana,  for example,  attempted  to  renovate  her  special  unified  public  transportation  ticket  for  people with  disabilities  (Bilhete  Único)  but  needed  printed  proof  that  she  was  a  beneficiary  of  the BPC,  as  the  Transportation  office  wouldn't  accept  digital  evidence  despite  her  attempts. So,  she  went  to  an  INSS  agency,  where  she  discovered  that  this  kind  of  service  was  no

longer  available  offline  and  that  she  would  have  to  use  the  Meu  INSS  app  on  her  device and  have  a  4G  connection.  No  computers  or  totems  were  available  for  her  to  print  the document  at  the  INSS  agency.  After  accessing  the  app  and  downloading  the  document, she  had  to  look  for  a  Descomplica  unit  to  print  for  free.  After  printing  it,  she  had  to  hand in  the  paper  in  person  to  the  physical  agency  of  the  Transportation  office  to  have  her ticket  renovated.

When asked about what should be different, the way to improvement is also ambivalent,  pointing  to offline and digital solutions, as  exemplified  by  two  opposite speeches.

- ' What  had  to  be  different to be better?  Go  back  to  the old  days  …  go  back  to normally  serving  the  people,  get  in  line,  …  give  the  number  of  the  password  to people  to  get  to  the  attendant  …  This  is  what  would  be  best  for  the  elderly '  (Sofia).
- ' …  and  also  improve  the  online  customer  service…  because  sometimes  if  a  service, for  example,  from  Poupatempo,  goes  wrong,  you  have  excellent  online  customer  service, but  if  a  service  from  the  Digital  Work  Card  goes  wrong,  you  have  to  move  from  here  to the  city  center,  and  for  those  who  work,…  you  don't  have  time  to  go…  So,  when  they improve  the  digital  customer  service,  you  don't  need  to  have  this  commute,  nor  miss your  job  to  solve  it  either ,  or ,  for  example,  leave  the  outskirts,  cross  the  city  that  is  more than 15  km … '  (Camila).

## 5 Discussion

The  results  of  the  interpretative  phenomenological  analysis  (IPA)  highlighted  four  major group  experiential  statements  (GETs)  regarding  how  disadvantaged  women  from  the outskirts  of  Sªo  Paulo  experience  the  digitalization  of  social  policies  and  services,  with consequences  for  their  well-being.  GETs  are  summarized  in  Table  3.

| 3. Reinforcement of gender roles and burdens | Whether digital services represent one more challenge in a life full of responsibilities or a victory and an opportunity that facilitates women's lives, they reinforce the gender roles associated with care work                                                                                                                                                        |
| 4. An evolving and fragmented experience     | The use of services over the years implies gaining experience and defining preferences, and most participants acknowledge the evolution of services. Inconsistencies between different service channels or a lack of interoperability among services do not go unnoticed, resulting in a fragmented experience. Envisioned futures to digital welfare are also ambivalent |

First,  as  no  other  alternative  was  left,  despite  financial,  educational,  and  other  constraints  that  some  of  the  participants  faced,  women  had  to  manage  access  to  digital  social services,  create  strategies  to  deal  with  limitations,  count  on  nets  of  solidarity  [23],  or  pay for  help  as  many  agencies  don't  have  face-to-face  service  anymore,  nor  totems  or  computers  that  can  be  used  with  the  assistance  of  a  public  agent.  However,  that  doesn't  mean meaningful  connectivity  [5]  in  terms  of  signal  quality  or  access  to  adequate  devices-a common  experience  that  all  participants  share,  one  way  or  another,  even  those  who  are better  off.

Some  of  the  interviewed  women  live  on  a  minimal  wage  per  month  (U$  260)  for the  whole  family,  and  internet  and  devices  have  become  an  obligation  they  must  afford, leaving  other  necessities  unattended.  Many  participants  reported  having  debts  they  could not  repay.  Women,  and  black/brown  women  in  particular,  usually  face  lower  levels  of salary  and  financial  deprivation,  and  digitalization  adds  one  more  monthly  cost.  While there  were  no  women  completely  excluded  from  services,  the  experiences  of  participants were  aligned  with  the  literature,  which  highlights  the  intersection  of  particular  contexts of  disadvantage  and  the  cost  of  complying  with  digital  services  [17].

Second,  in digital welfare, feelings of disrespect, anguish, humiliation, fear, and tiredness,  and  the  opposite,  feelings  of  being  a  citizen,  of  respect,  embracement,  and care,  are  all  present  as  intersectional  identities  such  as  age,  capabilities,  level  of  education,  family  configuration  among  others,  play  an  essential  role  in  the  experience.  This ambivalence  brings  at  least  two  implications.

Adding  to  previous  work  [3,  22,  25],  the  first  implication  is  that  the  design,  implementation,  and  evaluation  of  digital  services,  particularly  digital  social  services,  should account  for  the  experiences  of  real  people  in  their  contexts  as  unintended  or  unexpected consequences  and  perceptions  can  only  be  unveiled  in  the subjective experiences  of individuals.  As  stated  by  Almman  &amp;  Radu  [3,  p.  85],  we  need  to  look  into  the  ' mundane

rhythms of everyday life that the mechanisms  of  exclusion operate, only to  become wickedly  complex  patterns  of  marginalisation  at  scale '.

At  the  same  time,  another  implication  is  an  invitation  to  reflection  on  whether  digital exclusion  research,  added  by  the  literature  on  digital  welfare  [e.g.,  2,  11],  has  put  so  much emphasis  on  the  harming  consequences  of  digital  government  -  a  focus  that  is  extremely important  and  justified - that  a  look  into  the  good  consequences  that  live  together  with the bad ones, in  the  context  of  disadvantaged  citizens,  has  been  neglected.  Contrary to  what  the  evidence  in  the  literature  suggested,  some  of  the  disadvantaged  women  in this  research  also  demonstrated  satisfaction  and  embracement  in  their  experiences  with digital  welfare,  not  just  exclusion.  These  positive  experiences  cannot  be  attributed  solely to  young  age,  but  also  to  personal  preferences  and  individual  contexts,  as  in  the  case  of Mrs.  Valentina,  and  may  offer  insights  to  improve  practice.

Third,  women's  accounts  of  experiences  also  reveal  how  digital  welfare  is  deeply intertwined  with  the  cycle  of  life  and  the  experience  of  being  a  woman.  Retirement, loneliness,  motherhood,  affiliation,  and  paid  and  unpaid  work  are  essential  aspects  of  how women  experience  e-government,  shaping  meanings  and  feelings  within  digital  welfare. As  some  participants  perceive  digital  welfare  as  a  positive  experience  or  as  a  means to  fulfill  a  citizenship  ideal,  it  is  also  viewed  as  an  additional  complication,  increased responsibility,  and  a  reinforcement  of  traditional  gender  roles.  More  attention  should  be paid  to  how  life  situations  and  the  symbolic  and  concrete  aspects  of  women's  identities are  considered  in  the  design,  implementation,  and  evaluation  of  digital  services,  avoiding the  risk  of  engendering  gendered  administrative  burdens  [16]  and  moving  towards  an inclusive  vision  [24]  of  gender  in  digital  government.

Finally,  participants  acknowledged  gaining  experience  with  digital  technology  over the  years  and  recognized  the  evolution  of  digital  services,  underscoring  the  importance of  temporal  analysis  and  longitudinal  studies.  The  research  also  revealed  that  fragmentation  and  inconsistencies  are  not  overlooked,  indicating  that  women  perceive  digital welfare  as  a  system  comprising  both  digital  and  non-digital  processes  that  should  work in  harmony,  including  interoperability  among  different  services  and  levels  of  government,  both  vertically  and  horizontally.  If  experiences  are  ambivalent,  answers  to  digital welfare  challenges  cannot  be  unique.  Both  more  profound  levels  of  digitalization  and improved  offline  services  are  desired,  with  design  responsive  to  women's  struggles  and gender  burdens.  To  meet  the  diverse  needs  of  women,  easy  access  to  rights  in  all  forms, including  offline  formats,  emerges  as  the  future  of  digital  welfare  they  hope  for,  easing the  burdens  and  empowering  the  women  they  are.

## 6 Final Considerations

This  exploratory  and  inductive  research  demonstrated  that  disadvantaged  women  living in  the  M'Boi  Mirim  region,  out  of  necessity,  found  their  way  to  the  internet  and  digital welfare,  even if that  meant  relying  on neighbors,  family, volunteers, or paid helpers to  access  and  use  it.  However,  experiences  dealing  with  digital  welfare  are  ambivalent and influenced by various identity configurations, including age, level of education, capabilities,  family  structure,  personal  circumstances,  and  the  design  of  services.

From  the  theoretical  perspective,  the  study  helps  to  unveil  how  digital  social  services may,  at  the  same  time,  inflict  feelings  of  anxiety,  disablement,  fight,  and  exclusion,  as

also  feelings  of  inclusion,  embracement,  and  citizenship  that  add  to  their  offline  struggles related  to  intersectional  identities.

From  a  practical  perspective,  the  study  reveals  the  symbolic  and  concrete  meanings  and  consequences  of  digitalized  welfare  for  the  day-to-day  lives  of  disadvantaged women,  taking  into  account  their  differences  and  providing  insights  into  service  design, implementation,  evaluation,  and  improvement.  Suppose  services  are  to  reduce  injustice and  offer  opportunities  to  women  to  subvert  structures  that  diminish  their  ability  to  thrive; they  should  consider  women  not  as  a  unified  category  but  rather  as  individuals  living  in different  contexts.  Notably,  old  age,  reproductive  and  care  labor,  and  disabilities  should be  taken  into  consideration  from  the  demand  side.

The  study  has  limitations.  One  is  regarding  the  methodological  approach,  which doesn't  allow  for  generalization  and  thus  calls  for  more  research,  including  larger  samples  and  variation  of  methods.  Regarding  geography,  the  research  was  conducted  in an  urban  area  of  a  large  metropolis,  where  internet  infrastructure,  access  opportunities, and  educational  levels  tend  to  be  higher  than  in  other  regions  of  the  country  and  of  the Global  South.  Therefore,  different  contexts  might  offer  other  perspectives.  Additionally, the  study  focused  on  racialized  women  of  similar  social  class  and  gender  identities  from the  outset,  thereby  limiting  the  problematization  of  other  aspects  of  gender,  class,  and color/race,  which  are  central  to  intersectionality.  Gender  burdens  also  manifest  differently  in  various  parts  of  the  globe.  Still,  as  the  research  explores  women's  experiences in depth, the  reader can examine  and  judge  the  transferability  of  the results to other contexts  [19]  independently.

Future  studies  on  different  contexts,  focusing  on  the  intersectional  experiences  of women,  for  example,  delving  deeper  into  the  specificities  of  care  and  reproductive  work, would  contribute  to  elucidating  the  mechanisms  through  which  administrative  gender burdens  operate  in  digital  welfare  and  how  to  overcome  them.  However,  the  research also  shows  that  studies  on  the  positive  experiences  of  disadvantaged  women  and  the empowering  aspects  of  digital  welfare  are  required,  as  there  may  be  more  to  learn  from women  and  digital  welfare  than  just  accounts  of  exclusion.

Abstract. This  paper  develops  an  analytical  framework  based  on  the  usability principles  of  Jacob  Nielsen  and  Ben  Shneiderman  to  examine  how  federal  systems  approach  online  service  design  standards.  Focusing  on  Australia  and  Canada, the  paper  explores  the  interplay  between  federal  and  regional-level  design  standards  and  manuals,  highlighting  the  challenges  and  complementarities  in  achieving  consistency  across  government  levels.  Being  the  only  country  with  design standards  uniformly  applied  across  all  levels  of  government,  Denmark  is  referred to  in  the  analysis.  The  paper  finds  that  while  most  approaches  align  with  Nielsen's and  Shneiderman's  recommendations,  they  differ  in  their  implementation,  compliance  mechanisms,  and  inter-governmental  coordination.  The  paper  concludes with  a  set  of  policy  recommendations  for  federal  contexts.

## 1 Introduction

As  governments  increasingly  transition  service  delivery  to  digital  platforms  worldwide, the  need  for  coherent  and  user-centred  design  has  increasingly  become  a  critical  policy  concern.  Usability  plays  a  fundamental  role  in  digital  services,  as  poorly  designed services  frustrate  users  and  lead  to  higher  support  costs  and  reduced  user  adherence, leading  to  financial  inefficiencies  [1,  2].  Since  2012,  a  prominent  approach  to  offer  a structured tool to ensure a minimum  level  of usability  has  been  government  design standards  and  guides.  While  national  standards  have  existed  for  over  a  decade,  the  first regional-level  service  design  standards  began  to  appear  in  2019  in  federal countries, marking  a  relatively  recent  development  in  multi-level  digital  governance.

Federal  systems  add  a  layer  of  complexity  in  this  regard.  Users,  both  citizens  and businesses,  are  oftentimes  unfamiliar  with  the  division  of  responsibilities  between  federal, regional, and local levels of government.  Users have a reasonable expectation of  consistency  in  the  user  interface  across  the  public  sector,  leading  to  fragmented  and

inconsistent  user  experiences.  Addressing  these  inconsistencies  often  requires  structured collaboration  across  levels  of  government.  This  paper  tries  to  understand  the  existence or  absence  of  such  collaboration  across  multi-level  systems.

As  part  of  a  broader  research  project  that  aims  to  map  the  different  approaches  to government  design  standards  and  respective  compliance  models,  this  paper  examines how  federal  systems  navigate  these  challenges,  focusing  on  Australia  and  Canada  as  case studies,  as  well  as  two  regional-level  governments  in  each  of  these  countries:  New  South Wales  and  South  Australia  for  the  first,  Alberta  and  Ontario  for  the  latter.  By  comparing these  systems,  the  paper  seeks  to  answer  a  central  question: How  do  governments  within federal  systems  ensure  a  minimum  level  of  usability  and  consistency  in  public  sector digital  services  across  multiple  levels  of  government? In  doing  so,  it  addresses  a  gap  in the  literature  on  how  user  experience  is  operationalised  to  be  consistent  across  multi-level governance  settings.

The  structure  of this paper  is as follows:  Section  2 provides  a  cursory  review  of online usability as  a  point  of  reference.  Section  3  presents  the  paper's  methodology, including  the  assessment  framework  developed  for  the  paper.  Section  4  analyses  the  two national  and  four  regional-level  governmental  approaches  to  online  usability.  Section  5 identifies how  governments  attempt  to improve  online usability with service design standards  and  what,  if any, is their  approach  to  tackling  consistency  across  different levels  of  government.  In  this  connection,  the  paper  draws  on  the  example  of  Denmark as  a  benchmark  case  for  its  unique  approach  of  fully  unified  design  standards  across all  levels  of  government.  Section  6  concludes  with  a  set  of  policy  recommendations on  what  may  be  considered  good  practices  for  usability  requirements  and  compliance mechanisms,  with  a  particular  focus  on  federal  contexts.

## 2 Online  Usability

Usability  has  been  a  significant  concern  in  digital  service  design  since  the  late  1990s.  A review  of  academic  literature  (using  Google  Scholar  and  ScienceDirect)  reveals  various research  strands  focused  on  usability  and  user-friendliness  in  online  services  and  website design.

Some  research  is concerned  with  accessibility and inclusive design, focusing  on making  web  content  accessible  to  all  users,  including  those  with  disabilities.  The  Web Content  Accessibility  Guidelines  (WCAG),  developed  by  the  W3C  [3,  4],  are  widely adopted,  with  many  governments  integrating  them  into  their  policies,  also  being  recommended  by  the  UN  in  relation  to  the  Convention  on  the  Rights  of  Persons  with  Disability. Similarly,  research  on  human-centred  design  and  usability  standards  emphasises  designing  systems  that  prioritise  user  needs  and  capabilities.  The  ISO  9241  series,  particularly Parts  110  and  210,  provide  comprehensive  guidelines  on  ergonomic  requirements  and human-centred  design  processes  [5,  6].

A  third  strand  of  research  focuses  on  User  Experience  (UX)  evaluation  and  measurement,  namely  in  assessing  user  satisfaction  and  the  overall  quality  of  web  interactions. Studies  have  explored  various  models  and  metrics  to  evaluate  UX,  such  as  the  Unified Theory  of  Acceptance  and  Use  of  Technology  (UTAUT)  model  [7-11],  which  examines factors  influencing  the  adoption  of  e-government  services;  or  design  thinking  [12,  13],

which  proposes  approaches  (i.e.  processes  and  tools)  to  ensure  that  end-users  are  engaged in  the  design,  development,  testing,  and  production  of  services.  While  these  standards and  approaches  are  internationally  recognised  and  serve  as  benchmarks  for  usability  in system  design,  none  address  language  use,  and  only  indirectly  common  look-and-feel, functionality,  or  reuse  of  components  or  compliance  with  other  standards  or  legislation, e.g.,  privacy  and  data  protection.

Another  research  strand  emphasises  the  importance  of  cultural  and  contextual  factors  in  usability  and  how  they  impact  user  interaction  with  websites  and  online  services [14,  15].  This  strand  investigates  how  cultural  dimensions  influence  usability  perceptions,  including  language  [16],  colours,  aesthetics  [17],  and  their  impact  on  the  level  of perceived  satisfaction  [15].  Research  has  led  to  the  development  of  culturally-oriented usability  evaluation  tools  to  better  cater  to  diverse  user  groups  [17,  18].

Among these,  design  thinking  uniquely  combines  accessibility,  perceived  ease  of  use, and  the  needs  of  individual  users  and  target  communities  [13,  19].  It  offers  a  practical, user-centred  framework  that  encourages  iterative  development  with  the  active  involvement  of  stakeholders.  However,  despite  these  strengths,  it  is  generally  applied  within  the context  of  single  solutions  or  organisations.

Unlike other research strands, design thinking is anchored  in research by Jacob Nielsen  [20]  and  Ben  Shneiderman  [21],  who  have  established  principles  that  continue to  influence  online  design  decisions.  Based  on  actual  user  behaviour,  Nielsen's  Designing Web  Usability  [20]  proposes  ten  principles,  or  heuristics,  to  increase  user-friendliness, focusing  on  a  simple  yet  consistent  experience.  One  key  feature  of  Nielsen's  principles  is that  he  sees  online  behaviour  as  universal,  not  influenced  by  any  social  or  demographic characteristics  of  the  user,  while  acknowledging  exceptions,  such  as  reading  patterns or different levels of IT skills. His heuristics are designed  to be broadly  applicable, considering  the  uniformity  in  how  users  interact  with  digital  systems.

By  comparison,  Shneiderman's Universal  Usability [21]  takes  a  more  nuanced  approach.  He  acknowledges  that  knowledge,  skills,  age,  gender,  socio-economic  status,  or cultural  differences  can  affect  online  behaviour  as  these  also  affect  user's  needs.  He  also sees  technology  and  hardware  as  relevant  in  shaping  user  experiences.  These  concerns are  visible  in  his  heuristics,  for  example,  suggesting  that  one  should  design  with  different skill  levels  in  mind,  giving  support  for  less  savvy  and  shortcuts  for  expert  users,  but  also that  interfaces  should  be  tailored  to  specific  user  tasks  and  preferences.

Beyond  Nielsen  and  Shneiderman,  much  of  the  usability  research  tends  to  emphasise  its  importance  for  value  creation,  such  as  return  on  investment  and  digital  inclusion, rather  than  proposing  concrete  solutions,  assessment  frameworks,  or  monitoring  mechanisms  on  the  actual  design  of  services.  From  the  2020s,  the  focus  has  mainly  been  on service  quality,  user-friendliness,  or  usability  [22-28],  which  in  turn  tend  to  be  linked to  trust  [29],  satisfaction,  and  loyalty  [24,  30,  31].  Other  topics  include  accessibility  for specific  groups,  such  as  the  visually  impaired  [32]  and  the  role  of  technology  in  enhancing  usability  [26,  33].  The  service  quality  literature  generally  examines  conceptual  elements  such  as  reliability/fulfilment,  responsiveness,  web  design,  ease  of  use/usability, privacy/security,  and  information  quality/benefit  [23,  24,  28,  32,  34].  These  elements, however,  remain  broad  conceptual  outcomes.  While  these  elements  could  form  the  basis of  assessment  criteria - for  example,  through  Likert  scales - this  is  rarely  attempted.

Adding  to  that,  key  international  and  regional  ICT-related  databases  and  benchmarks like  those  managed  by  the  ITU,  UNDESA,  World  Bank,  or  the  EU  do  not  measure service  use  or  usability  [35-39].

Early  attempts  to  establish  public  sector  principles  and  standards  include  the  Canadian  Common  Look  and  Feel  Standard  for  the  Internet  in  2000  [40],  the  Norwegian ELMER  in  2006  [41],  and  the  UK's  Guide  to  good  practice  in  commissioning  accessible  websites  in  2006  [42]  and  Web  accessibility  Code  of  Practice  in  2010  [43].  The 2012  launch  of  the  UK's  Digital  Service  Standards  [44,  45]  marked  a  turning  point  in the  relevance  given  to  usability  within  both  policy  circles  and  the  public  sector  [46,  47]. Since  then,  design  standards  have  gained  prominence  globally,  with  16  countries  across all  continents  publishing  national  standards  and/or  guidelines  [47].  Together  with  them, governance  and  compliance  models  have  emerged  as  critical  tools  for  ensuring  adherence  to  the  criteria  outlined  in  the  design  standards  [48-51].  Poor  usability  is,  indeed,  a major  barrier  to  the  adoption  of  digital  services,  which  limits  the  realisation  of  cost  and efficiency  gains  brought  by  digital  government.

While  often  aligned  wholly  or  partially  with  Nielsen  and  Shneiderman's  proposed criteria,  the  standards  and  their  governance  and  compliance  models  vary  in  detail  and scope.  At  the  same  time,  there  still  seems  to  be  a  trial-and-error  method  to  finding  the best  solutions,  as  is  suggested  by  the  findings  of  a  comparative  study  of  Denmark,  the UK,  and  Portugal  [52]  and  its  updates  over  time.

In  this  context,  this  paper  sheds  some  light  on  the  following  questions.  First, which principles  are  covered  by  design  standards  to  advance  online  service  usability? Second, which,  if  any,  governance  models  are  applied  to  report,  assess,  and  ensure  compliance? Third, which,  if  any,  are  the  strategies  used  to  ensure  consistency  in  service  delivery across  different  levels  of  government?

## 3 Methodology

To assess and compare  in a fair manner  the various approaches  to usability criteria from  different  countries,  the  recommendations  of  Nielsen  [20]  and  Shneiderman  [21] form  the  theoretical  basis  of  the  methodology  followed.  A  meta-synthesis  of  the  key recommendations  of  both  authors  is  developed  and  organised  around  overarching  categories  to  measure  each  country's  design  standards.  This  way,  an  assessment  framework that  adequately  serves  as  a  lens  for  evaluating  the  various  design  standards  is  reached 1 . By  grounding  the  assessment  in  established  usability  heuristics,  this  paper  enables  a more  granular  and  design-focused  comparison  that  can  complement  and  inform  maturity models  in  future  research.

Along  with  the  theoretical  recommendations  for  standards  that  primarily  focus  on what  a  website  should  achieve,  even  when  there  are  some  underlying  processes,  the assessment  framework  intentionally  includes  categories  that  are  more  connected  to  processes  (how  to  get  there).  Thus,  the  assessment  framework  includes  elements  like  toolkits, stylesheets,  practical  examples,  minimum  acceptance  criteria,  and  the  call  to  monitor use  and  usability  and  perform  user  testing.

1 This  framework  is  developed  as  part  of  a  broader  ongoing  research  project  aimed  at  developing a  comprehensive  approach  to  assess  and  compare  digital  government  design  standards.

Each  country's design standards are evaluated across 15 overarching categories, each comprising  varying criteria, on a 0-2 scale, where  zero (0) signifies either no or barely any reference  to the criterion, one (1) indicates that a criterion is partially covered, and two (2) denotes that a criterion is fully or close to fully covered. The 15  overarching  categories  are  'development  process',  'language  use',  'look-and-feel', 'functionality',  'reuse  of  components',  'reuse  of  standards',  'reuse  of  data',  'device independence',  'WCAG  Accessibility  standards',  'monitoring  of  use  and  usability', 'minimum  acceptance  criteria',  'user  testing',  'examples',  'toolkit',  and  'stylesheet'. Table  1  maps  the  process  from  the  theoretical  basis  to  the  final  assessment  framework.

For  each  country,  an  analysis  examines  how  this  information  is  presented,  the  coverage  of  the  standards,  i.e.,  to  which  institutions  and  organisations  it  applies,  and  whether its  adoption  is  voluntary  or  mandatory.  Finally,  the  mechanisms  to  report,  assess,  and ensure  compliance  are  also  analysed.  All  assessments  reflect  the  state  of  the  documents  as of  31  December  2024.  This  cut-off  date  ensures  comparability  across  cases  and  provides a  fixed  point  of  reference  for  analysis.

The  goal  is  to  uncover  insights  related  to  the  research  questions  through  an  analytical comparison.  In  addition  to  the  design  standards  and  associated  guidelines,  strategy  documents  such  as  policy  papers,  policy  recommendations,  digital  government  strategies, action  plans,  and  management  reports  are  analysed  where  relevant.  National  portals  are examined  to  assess  the  impact  of  the  design  standards  and  usability  guidelines  based  on the  premise  that  non-compliant  portals  suggest  other  authority  websites  and  eServices are  likely  non-compliant.

The  first  step  is  exploratory,  aiming  to  understand  how  the  information  is  organised  in each  country's  standards.  Then,  for  each  criterion,  the  most  relevant  quotes  are  collected as  evidence  of  its  coverage.  Afterwards,  each  criterion  is  assessed  throughout  the  different countries  for  increased  objectivity.  For  those  that  are  not  fully  compliant,  new  searches are  conducted  in  the  guidelines  and  associated  documents  using  keywords  used  by  the more  compliant  countries  to  make  sure  no  information  is  missed.  After  this,  a  second person  reviews  the  assessment,  basing  it  on  the  relevant  quotes,  with  any  differences being  thoroughly  discussed  and  compared  to  the  other  countries'  assessments.

The comparative design facilitates uncovering patterns and divergences in approaches  to  usability  standards  and  respective  governance  models  within  and  between federated  systems.  In  future  research,  this  analysis  could  be  expanded  with  interviews.

Globally,  16  countries  have  published  design  standards  or  similar  [47].  Although several  of  these  countries  have  a  federal  structure  (such  as  Mexico,  India,  or  the  USA), this  paper  focuses  on  the  cases  of  Australia  and  Canada  as  they  are  the  only  two  federal countries with published  design standards at both national (i.e.  federal  government) and regional levels (i.e. state or provincial government),  which  are  the  basis for the case  selection.  For  each,  two  state  or  provincial  approaches  were  chosen.  In  Canada, only  Alberta  and  Ontario  have  published  design  standards.  In  Australia,  Victoria  [53], New  South  Wales  [54],  South  Australia  [55],  and  Queensland  [56]  have  either  design standards  or  design  systems  in  place.  New  South  Wales  and  South  Australia  were  chosen for  having  publicly  available  standards  and  design  systems  and  different  approaches  to implementation.  Denmark  serves  as  a  complementary  reference  case,  as  it  is  the  only

country  where  the  standards  are  developed  and  apply  equally  to  all  levels  of  government [47,  52],  which  could  offer  insights  into  cross-governmental  consistency.

## 4 Approaches  to  Design  Standards,  and  Governance and  Compliance  Models

With  a  focus  on  Australia  and  Canada,  both  at  the  federal  and  the  regional  levels,  namely the  states  of  New  South  Wales  and  South  Australia  and  the  provinces  of  Alberta  and Ontario,  this  section  outlines  their  approaches  to  usability  criteria  and  governance  and compliance  models,  also  trying  to  draw  upon  any  communication  between  different levels  of  government.

For each case, the first section analyses the approach to usability, describing how  information  is  presented,  which  entity  or  entities  are  responsible,  any  tools  and guidelines,  and  further  evaluation  within  the  assessment  framework.

This  is  followed  by  a  second  section  identifying  each  country's  governance  and  compliance  model,  including  who  must  comply,  who  is  responsible  for  assessing,  reporting and  monitoring  compliance,  and  what  processes  apply  to  ensure  it.

## 4.1 Australia

## Federal

Approach  to  Usability

The  Australian Digital Service Standard  [57] was  launched  in its current version in December  2023  and  last  updated  in  October  2024.  It  defines  the  criteria  under  which government  services should be developed and designed. The first version, 1.0, was launched  in  2015.  The  Digital  Transformation  Agency  (DTA)  is  the  authority  responsible for  these  service  standards.

The  standards  comprises  ten  criteria,  each  of  them  having  a  brief  explanation,  followed  by  the  responsibilities  of  those  who  develop  to  meet  each  specific  criterion,  the development  phase  in  which  that  criterion  should  be  mainly  observed,  a  set  of  questions to  consider,  and  a  list  of  suggested  activities  to  apply  the  criterion.  Finally,  it  presents  a list  of  tools  and  resources  that  can  be  used  to  learn  more  about  each  topic.

The  Digital  Service  Standard  is  included  in  a  broader  toolkit  comprising  information and  resources  on  ICT  investment,  transitioning  from  the  previous  to  the  current  version of  the  standards,  user  research,  and  teams'  management,  among  others.  A  set  of  relevant communities  of  practice  for  government  specialists,  practitioners,  and  leaders  to  share experiences  is  also  provided,  as  well  as  the  Australian  Government  Style  Manual  [58] and  the  GOLD  Design  System  [59].

When  assessed  against the paper's assessment  framework,  it covers most of the overarching categories, namely  the development  process, functionality, the reuse of components,  standards,  and  data,  device  independence,  the  WCAG  accessibility  criteria, the  need  for  monitoring  of  use  and  usability,  as  well  as  having  minimum  acceptance criteria.  It  partially  covers  language  use,  look-and-feel,  and  the  need  for  user  testing.

According  to  the  responsible  authority,  version  2.0  reduced  the  criteria  from  13  to ten,  improving  the  accessibility  and  inclusion  requirements  and  introducing  new  ones for  staff-facing  services.

## Governance  and  Compliance  Model

The  standards  apply  to  all  informational,  transactional,  and  staff-facing  services  by  the federal  government  and  its  entities  (the  so-called  NCCE  -  non-corporate  Commonwealth entities).  While  public-facing  informational  and  transactional  services  must  adhere  to the  standards,  regardless  of  whether  they  are  pre-existing  or  new,  staff-facing  services only  have  to  meet  the  standards  if  they  are  new.  State,  territory,  or  local  government services  are  not  required  to  follow  the  standards,  but  they  may  choose  to  if  they  want  'to improve  access  and  discoverability  of  their  digital  services'  [60].  Personal  ministerial websites  are  also  not  required  to  follow  the  principles.

While  applying  the  standards  is  mandatory,  federal  agencies  may  request  a  partial or complete  exemption  if  justified by the existence of legacy technology  barriers or disproportionate  financial  burden.

DTA  is  responsible  for  monitoring  websites  based  on  self-reported  compliance.  This monitoring  was  set  to  start  for  new  services  in  July  2024  and  for  existing  public-facing services  in  July  2025.  However,  the  mechanism  was  not  published  apart  from  a  note saying  DTA  would  engage  with  stakeholders  and  develop  a  reporting  framework  before the  requirements  were  put  in  place,  leading  to  the  belief  that  it  was  behind  schedule.

DTA  also  outlines  the  process  to  get  approval  for  ICT  Investments,  which  is  key  for big  projects.  For  this,  a  proposal  must  be  submitted  following  the  principles  outlined  in the  Standards,  for  DTA  to  assess.

## New  South  Wales

Approach  to  Usability

The  Australian  state  of  New  South  Wales  has  established  its  own  Design  Standards.  It is  integrated  into  a  more  extensive  set  of  tools  called  the  Digital  Service  Toolkit  [54].  It was  launched  in  May  2022  and  last  updated  in  July  2022.

The  Design  Standards  are  composed  of  ten  rules,  presented  with  a  brief  explanation and  a  set  of  implementation  measures  in  bullet  points  that  make  each  rule  more  tangible. These  standards  are  integrated  into  the  aforementioned  toolkit,  which  also  includes  a design  system,  resources  for  user  research,  user  experience  and  design,  content  writing,  testing,  and  collaboration  tools.  It  also  includes  templates  and  solutions  previously developed  that  any  agency  can  use.  Examples,  however,  are  rarely,  if  at  all,  provided.

With  respect  to  the  paper's  assessment  framework,  the  Design  Standards  include information  about  the  development  process,  the  reuse  of  components,  relevant  standards and  data,  the  WCAG  accessibility  standards,  minimum  acceptance  criteria,  and  the  need for  user  testing.  It  partially  covers  language  use  and  the  need  to  monitor  use  and  usability. There  is  either  no  or  only  scarce  reference  to  look-and-feel,  functionality,  and  device independence.

Across  the  toolkit,  there  is  minimal  reference  to  federal  documents  or  standards, except  for  very  specific  topics,  such  as  cybersecurity.  However,  it  is  interesting  to  note that  the  'Credits'  section  on  the  Delivery  Manual  specifies  that  these  resources  are  built upon  three  guides:  the  GOV .UK  service  manual,  international  standards  and  the  first that  appeared,  the  Australian  Service  Design  (federal),  and  Ontario  Public  Service,  the manual  of  another  region  in  a  different  federal  setting.  The  steps  for  development  in New  South  Wales  are  an  expansion  of  the  ones  in  the  Federal  standards.

## Governance  and  Compliance  Model

The  design  standards,  the  design  system,  and  all  the  related  components  are  voluntary for  all  parties.  The  design  standards  are  maintained  by  Digital  NSW,  which  is  an  integral part  of  the  regional  state-level  government.  All  state-level  agencies  and  departments  that use  the  design  standards  are  encouraged  to  establish  metrics,  collect  data,  and  conduct an  iterative  process  of  monitoring  and  improving.  However,  this  is  a  self-assessment method,  and  no  formal  compliance  model  is  in  place.

## South  Australia

Approach  to  usability

The  Online  Accessibility  Toolkit  [55]  was  developed  by  the  Government  of  South  Australia.  The  government  approved  the  Online  Accessibility  Policy  in  May  2019,  derived from  the  federal  Digital  Service  Standard.  It  was  last  updated  in  June  2021.

The  Online  Accessibility  Toolkit  is  organised  as  a  set  of  different  guides  for  specific tasks. Each has a separate page explaining why  it is important, followed by a task description.  It  then  goes  on  to  describe  the  Steps  to  Take,  often  with  several  links  to helpful tools. Sometimes,  there  is  a short video  on  the topic and  a set  of  supporting resources.  It  focuses  more  on  accessibility  and  frames  most  topics  within  that  scope.  It often  refers  to  the  national  standards,  including  in  the  service  design  section,  where  it points  to  the  adoption  of  the  national  process  manual.

With  respect  to  the  paper's  assessment  framework,  the  toolkit  references  to  the  reuse of  components  and  standards,  device  independence,  the  WCAG  accessibility  criteria, and  the  need  for  user  testing.  It  partially  covers  the  development  process,  language  use, look-and-feel,  and  functionality.  There  is  no  reference  to  the  reuse  of  data  nor  the  need for  monitoring  use  and  usability.  There  are  also  no  minimum  acceptance  criteria.  It  also has  a  toolkit  that  adds  important  information,  such  as  a  Website  Design  System  and  an Online  Forms  Platform.  It  also  adopts  the  Federal  style  manual.

## Governance  and  Compliance  Model

According  to  state-level  policy,  the  toolkit  must  be  applied  to  every  South  Australian government  online  application,  including  public  and  staff-facing  applications.

Although  it is mandatory  to comply  with  the Toolkit standards, there is no formal  screening  process,  making  compliance  with  the  criteria  reliant  on  trust  and  selfassessment.  However,  any  vendor  contracted  regarding  ICT  development  must  prove they  will  comply  with  the  accessibility  criteria.

## 4.2 Canada

## Federal

Approach  to  Usability

The  Designing  for  Canada.ca  [61]  website  was  launched  by  the  Federal  Canadian  government  in July 2017  and  contains  a set of standards  and  a toolkit.  The  responsible agency  is  the  Digital  Transformation  Office  (DTO),  which  is  part  of  Employment  and Social  Development  Canada.  The  toolkit  expands  and  complements  the  existing  Web Experience  Toolkit  [62]  (in  place  since  at  least  2012).  The  standards  and  toolkit  are  managed  by  the  Treasury  Board  of  Canada  Secretariat,  but  its  development  and  maintenance involve  a  collaborative  process.

The  standards  include  a  set  of  guidelines  and  tools.  Most  of  them  are  organised  first with  the  most  recent  updates  made,  followed  by  the  purpose  of  that  guide  or  tool,  how to  use  it,  and  a  set  of  related  policies,  standards,  and  procedures,  after  which  follows  its actual  content.

With  respect  to  the  paper's  assessment  framework,  the  Canadian  Digital  Service  is clear  about  language  use,  reuse  of  components  and  data,  device  independence,  WCAG accessibility  criteria,  monitoring  of  use  and  usability,  and  user  testing.  It  partially  covers the  development  process,  look-and-feel,  functionality,  and  the  reuse  of  standards.  It  also partially covers the need for minimum  acceptance  criteria.  It  is  complemented  by  a Style  Guide  [63],  a  Design  System  [64],  and  the  previously  mentioned  Web  Experience Toolkit.

## Governance  and  Compliance  Model

Application  of  the  'Canada.ca  Content  and  Information  Architecture  Specification'  (the Canada.ca  design)  is  mandatory  for  'departments  and  other  portions  of  the  federal  public administration'.  All  149  institutions  that  must  comply  are  listed.  It  is  also  mandatory to  adhere  to  the  Standard  on  Web  Accessibility,  the  Standard  on  Web  Usability,  and  the Standard  on  Web  Interoperability.  The  Web  Experience  Toolkit  is  optional  but  recommended,  as  it  helps  agencies  to  comply  with  these  standards.  Territory  and  province governments  (i.e.,  regional  level)  are  neither  acknowledged  nor  mentioned  within  the standards  or  associated  toolkits.

It  is  clear  which  parts  of  the  extensive  guidelines  and  tools  are  mandatory  and  which are  voluntary.  However,  there  is  no  mention  of  any  mechanisms  to  ensure  compliance. The  departments  and  agencies  responsible  for  government  websites  and  eServices  are urged  to  continuously  improve  usability  by  monitoring  and  measuring  task  success.  This is  based  on  a  recommended  self-assessment  procedure.

All  departments  and  agencies  subject  to  the  Directive  on  the  Management  of  Communications  must  implement  the  GC  Task  Success  Survey  on  their  web  properties  and report  its  results  to  the  Government  of  Canada.  There  is,  however,  no  screening  process detailed  starting  from  there.

## Alberta

## Approach  to  Usability

Alberta's  Digital  Experience  Standard  [65]  is  managed  by  the  Government  of  Alberta. Although  there  is  no  mention  of  the  date  it  was  created  or  its  last  update,  using  the  Wayback  Machine  [66],  it  was  possible  to  find  it  was  first  referenced  in  August  2023,  and  its last  recorded  update  is  from  July  2024.  The  responsible  authority  is  the  Communications and  Public  Engagement  Ministry.

The  standards  and  associated  tools  comprise  a  checklist  to  ensure  compliance,  a  set  of code  elements,  and  a  design  system.  This  is  complemented  with  a  set  of  content  guides. The  standards  are  mandatory  for  every  public-facing  website  or  application  owned  and operated  by  the  Government  of  Alberta  and  its  agencies.  There  is  no  mention  of  the federal  or  national  level  service  provision  or  design  guide,  suggesting  there  is  no  formal coordination  and  collaboration  between  the  federal  and  provincial  levels.

With  respect  to  the  paper's  assessment  framework,  the  standards  are  thorough  about language  use,  reuse  of  components,  and  device  independence.  They  partially  cover  the development  process,  look-and-feel,  functionality,  reuse  of  standards,  WCAG  accessibility  criteria,  and  the  need  for  user  testing.  They  do  not  cover  reuse  of  data  and  the  need to  monitor  use  and  usability.  They  includes  minimum  acceptance  criteria,  examples,  a toolkit,  and  a  stylesheet.

## Governance  and  Compliance  Model

The  standards  are  mandatory  for  all  public-facing  websites  and  applications  owned  and operated  by  the  Government  of  Alberta.

The  web  governance  team  at  the  Ministry  of  Communications  &amp;  Public  Engagement monitors  the  process.  First,  project  owners  are  invited  to  review  the  standards  and  make sure  what  they  want  to  build  is  compliant,  after  which  they  are  prompted  to  contact  the web  governance  team,  who  should  assess  to  what  point  it  can  be  integrated  with  the government  portal  or  other  Government  of  Alberta's  websites.  Some  contents  might  be directly  built  into  the  government's  portal  to  avoid  duplication.  After  this,  they  should contact the  communications  team  from  the  ministry  to  which  the  project  belongs  to analyse interactions and communication  timelines.  Lastly,  the team  can develop  the website  or application  in line with the  standards'  requirements.  The  last  two  to  four weeks  before  launch  are  designated  for  a  pre-launch  review  by  the  web  governance team,  which  will  make  sure  it  is  compliant  and  can  be  published.

## Ontario

## Approach  to  Usability

Ontario's  Digital  Service  Standard  [67]  is  managed  by  the  Government  of  Ontario  to assist  provincial  agencies  and  ministries  in  building  and  delivering  simpler,  faster,  and better  government  services  and  products.  It  was  first  published  in  January  2021  and  last updated  in  October  2024.

The  standards  include  a  description  of  the  development  process,  including  the  phases of  publishing  and  13  principles  considered  essential  to  good  service  delivery.  Each  has  a short  explanation  of  what  it  is,  a  section  on  why  it  matters,  and  a  final  one  on  how  to  meet it.  In  this  final  section,  the  information  is  organised  by  minimum  requirements  and  what to  consider  in  each  development  phase.  Lastly,  when  applicable,  there  is  a  section  on laws  and  rules  to  follow  within  the  scope  of  that  principle.  The  standards  and  associated manual  acknowledge  their  inspiration  in  several  other  standards,  including  the  Canadian national  one,  as  well  as  Australia,  the  UK  and  the  USA.

The  standards  are  complemented  by  the  Ontario  Design  System  [68],  which  includes a  stylesheet,  components  that  can  be  reused,  and  examples.

With  respect  to  the  assessment  framework,  these  standards  cover  the  development process,  reuse  of  components,  standards,  and  data,  device  independence,  WCAG  accessibility  criteria,  the  need  for  monitoring  of  use  and  usability,  and  user  testing.  They  also partially  cover  language  use,  look-and-feel,  and  functionality.

## Governance  and  Compliance  Model

The  standards  and  associated  manual  are  produced  for  all  ministries  and  agencies  of the  Government  of  Ontario.  However,  compliance  is  voluntary,  based  on  decentralised responsibility,  with  no  formal  or  mandatory  screening  process  in  place.

## 5 Analysis

Having presented the two federal and four regional-level (i.e. six individual cases) approaches  to  design  standards  for  service  delivery, which  principles  are  covered  by design  standards  to  advance  online  service  usability?

Table  2  maps  the  six  approaches  utilising  the  paper's  assessment  framework.  The mapping  applies  the  0-2  scale  outlined  in  the  methodology.

The  analysis  finds that  all  six  cases  have  incorporated  the  overarching  principles in  the  framework.  This  confirms  the  impact  and  continued  relevance  of  Nielsen's  and Shneiderman's  work.  It  is  worth  noting  that both federal governments  cover  at  least partially  every  overarching  category,  while  three  of  the  regional-level  standards  fail  to include  at  least  a  couple  of  topics,  with  Ontario  being  the  exception.

With  respect  to which,  if  any,  governance  models  are  applied  to  report,  assess, and  ensure  compliance? ,  the  analysis  finds  that  both  coverage  and  approaches  vary significantly.  The  Australian  and  the  Canadian  federal  governments,  as  well  as  South Australia,  make  compliance  mandatory,  but  have  no  formal  mechanism  to  ensure  it.  The Australian  federal  government  makes  larger  ICT  investments  subject  to  approval  by  the same  agency  that  oversees  the  standards  but  does  not  have  an  associated  compliance mechanism.  In  this case, full or partial exemptions  can  be  granted  upon  request  for authorities  that  cannot  comply,  for  example,  because  of  legacy  technology  or  excessive financial  burden.

The  Australian  federal government  was  set  to publish  a  self-reporting  and  monitoring mechanism  but  is  yet to do so. In South  Australia,  vendors  must  promise  to comply  and  prove  the  ability  to  do  so  prior  to  the  contract,  but  no  screening  or  reporting mechanisms  are  in  place.  By  comparison,  the  Canadian  federal  government  encourages

self-assessment  and  requires  self-reporting  via  the  submission  of  a  survey,  but  there  is no  screening  process.  These  three  cases  rely  on  decentralised  responsibility.

The  most  detailed  compliance  model  is  found  in  the  Government  of  Alberta.  Before development  starts,  the  web  governance  team  must  approve  all  public-facing  websites and  applications  owned  by  the  government.  It  can  either  approve  or  decide  to  integrate into  the  state's  portal  instead  to  avoid  repetitions.  After  development,  a  few  weeks  before launch,  it  goes  through  a  final  review  to  ensure  it  is  suitable  for  publishing.

In  Ontario  and  New  South  Wales,  compliance  with  the  regional-level  standards  is voluntary  and  lacks  any  formal  screening  or  compliance  mechanism.  The  similarity  is not  surprising  as  Ontario's  standards  and  approach  are  acknowledged  as  a  key  source of  inspiration  for  New  South  Wales.  While  New  South  Wales  suggests  self-monitoring and  a  self-assessed  iterative  process,  both  examples  rely  on  decentralised  responsibility.

It  is  also  relevant  to  note  that  both  federal  standards  are  voluntary  to  regional  and local-level  government  entities  and  have  little  reference  to  these  levels.

Lastly,  with  respect  to which,  if  any,  are  the  strategies  used  to  ensure  consistency in  service  delivery  across  different  levels  of  government? ,  the  approaches  analysed vary.  Overall  consistency  is  sought  mainly  at  the  government  level  targeted  by  a  given  set of  design  standards  or  usability  guide.  Consistency  across  levels  of  government  does  not seem  to  be  a  key  priority,  a  surprise  considering  that  emphasis  Nielsen  and  Schneiderman put  on  a  recognisable  and  consistent  user  experience.

In  Australia,  the  federal  and  New  South  Wales  (NSW)  standards  largely  overlook intergovernmental  consistency,  making  only  minimal  references  to  different  government levels. The national policy suggests, but does not require, adoption at lower levels, while  New  South  Wales  acknowledges  national  and  international  influences  (i.e.  UK and Ontario)  for serving  as the basis for the one being  developed  there.  In contrast, South  Australia  actively  integrates  and  mandates  national  guidelines  within  its  regional framework.

Similarly,  Canada  exhibits  a  lack  of  coordination  between  federal  and  regional  levels. Ontario,  like  New  South  Wales,  merely  cites  national  standards  as  an  inspiration  without  structured  integration.  Alberta  demonstrates  similar  fragmentation,  reinforcing  the broader  issue  of  governmental  silos.  This  lack  of  alignment  risks  creating  inconsistencies that  may  undermine  trust,  usability,  and  service  adoption.

Denmark  offers  a  counterexample  despite  not  being  a  federative  system.  It  employs  a formalised  intergovernmental  coordination  mechanism  involving  national,  regional,  and local  authorities.  Through  jointly  agreed  standards,  Denmark  ensures  a  coherent  user experience  across  government  levels  [47,  52].  Specifically,  the  Danish  design  standards have  three  levels  of  requirements:  those  from  external  sources,  which  are  transpositions of  legislation,  agreements,  or  similar;  jointly  agreed  requirements,  which  result  from a  formal  intergovernmental  platform  of  communication  that  includes  state  authorities, Local  Government  Denmark  (LGDK),  and  Danish  Regions  (DR);,  and;  finally  requirements  that  only  apply  to  self-service  solutions  that  are  to  be  included  in  the  national portals  (i.e.  borger.dk,  virk.dk  and  sundhed.dk).  The  formal  mechanism  for  coordination  and  collaboration  across  different  government  levels  sets  the  case  of  the  Danish approach  apart.  The  cross-governmental  approach  ensures  that  there  is  not  only  a  shared understanding of usability and design principles but also a framework  that actively involves  all  relevant  stakeholders  in  the  decision-making  process.  The  result  is  a  consistent  user  experience  across  services,  regardless  of  whether  they  are  provided  by  national, regional,  or  local  authorities.  This  highlights  the  benefits  of  structured  collaboration,  a feature  largely  absent  in  the  Australian  and  Canadian  contexts  [47,  52].

Future  work  could  build  on  this  by  incorporating  user-centred  evaluations  to  assess how  fragmented  governance  approaches  potentially  manifest  themselves  in  actual  user journeys.  Such  future  research  should  ideally  be  complemented  with  interviews  with the authorities responsible for the design standards and toolkits, as well as selected stakeholders  from  the  public  sector  and  the  IT  vendor  community.

## 6 Conclusions  and  Policy  Recommendations

The  analysis  of  online  usability  and  service  standards  in  federal  countries,  with  case studies  from  Australia  and  Canada  and  reference  to  Denmark,  highlights  significant  commonalities  and  challenges  with  respect  to  standardising  digital  service  delivery.  Despite

differences  in  governmental  structures  and  approaches  to  compliance,  all  national  and regional-level  governments  acknowledge  the  importance  of  usability  in  alignment  with Nielsen's  and  Shneiderman's  heuristics.

A  critical  observation  is  the  variation  in  the  enforcement  of  usability  standards,  with some  jurisdictions  opting  for  voluntary  guidelines  (even  if  referred  to  as  standards)  while others  impose  mandatory  compliance  models.  However,  a  recurring  challenge  across all  studied  contexts  is  the  lack  of  alignment  and  coordination  between  different  levels of government.  This  fragmentation  results in inconsistent user experiences, creating potential  obstacles  for  end-users  interacting  with  services  across  multiple  governmental levels.

There  is  strong  evidence  that  national  standards  can  positively  influence  regional and  local  adoption,  as  seen  in  South  Australia's  full  adoption  of  federal  standards  and New  South  Wales  and Ontario's alignment with national frameworks.  Furthermore, Denmark's  approach  to  intergovernmental  collaboration  offers  a  model  for  enhancing cross-governmental  dialogue  and  coordination.

The  following five  policy  recommendations should  be  considered  to  address  these challenges  and  enhance  the  effectiveness  of  digital  service  standards  and  usability  principles. First, formalise  intergovernmental  coordination  and  collaboration through structured  mechanisms  for  communication  between  national,  regional,  and  local  governments  is  essential.  This  can  be  facilitated  through  dedicated  intergovernmental  working groups  or shared digital  governance  platforms  to  encourage  the  development  of unified  usability  standards.  Second, promote  consistency  across  all  government  levels to  ensure  greater  uniformity  and  recognisability  in  digital  service  design,  ensuring that  usability  principles  remain  consistent  regardless  of  the  level  of  government.  While flexibility  is  necessary  to  address  localised  needs,  user  groups  and  business  objectives, overarching  guidelines  can  enhance  user  experience  continuity.  Third, mandate  crossgovernmental  user  feedback  mechanisms through  feedback  loops  and  tools  that  collect and  incorporate  feedback  from  users  interacting  with  different  levels  of  government.  This would  help  identify  usability  challenges  and  drive  improvements  in  service  consistency. Fourth, encourage  a  bottom-up  approach  to  the  development  of  standards thereby allowing  regional  and  local  governments  to  contribute  actively  to  national  standards.  This ensures  that  policies  reflect  diverse  operational  contexts  and  helps  balance  the  need  for uniformity  with  local  and  user-specific  adaptability.  Fifth, investigate  the  effectiveness of  compliance  models ,  specifically  how  different  compliance  and  monitoring  models influence  the  adoption  and  effectiveness  of  usability  and  design  standards.  Understanding  these  dynamics  can  inform  policies  that  drive  meaningful  improvements  in  digital service  delivery.

By implementing  these recommendations,  governments  can  work  towards more cohesive  and  citizen-centric  digital  services,  ensuring  that  design  standards  and  usability principles  are  effectively  integrated  across  all  levels  of  the  public  sector.

Abstract. The public sector continues to struggle with the digital transformation of its organizations, lagging behind the private sector in implementing digital processes and services. A key success factor is the availability of appropriate digital skills in the workforce. This can be enhanced by training existing staff or hiring skilled individuals. In the latter scenario, the hiring process must focus on the required competencies. Typically, job advertisements are used to communicate job requirements. his article explores the presence of digital competencies in job ads of German public organizations. We operationalize the DigComp 2.2 framework as a category system to identify required digital competences in these job advertisements. To assess a large volume of job postings, we employ a Large Language Model (LLM) for categorization. In this way, we are able to process 5,949 job advertisements. Results indicate frequent mentions of skills related to digital content creation and data handling, while communication, problem-solving, and safety are rarely highlighted. Although the reasons for this are not explicitly identified in our study, a mismatch is evident between the push for digital transformation in the public sector and the recruitment practices reflected in job advertisements.

## 1 Introduction

To fulfill their duties, such as providing digital public services [ 35], creating public value [ 47], or managing crises [ 16], digitalization has become imperative for public organizations. However, many are struggling to overcome digital government barriers [ 50] and increasingly fall behind private sector counterparts [ 12].

Most administrative systems are rooted in sometimes centuries-old legislative frameworks [e.g., 4], which is why their organizational structures and functions are rarely designed for digital environments. As a result, organizations within

such systems must manage not only minor adaptations but significant reconfigurations of their entire operation - scholars refer to these as pre-digital  organizations [ 9]. Unlike born-digital organizations, which possess inherently digital characteristics such as agility practices, platform thinking, and openness to technology [ 46], pre-digital ones struggle to adapt their structures to changing environments [ 9]. Given that organizations are essentially groups of individuals working together to fulfill shared objectives [ 7], this article focuses on one specific organizational function: Human Resource (HR) management.

HR Management is considered one of the most significant challenges for pre-digital organizations striving to enhance their digitalization maturity [ 20]. HR Management primarily serves two purposes: first, internal talent development, and second, external talent acquisition [ 2]. With regard to digital transformation, the first purpose aims at providing the workforce with competence development means. The second purpose seeks to hire digital talent from outside the organization. In the context of digital government, competence development is relatively well researched, e.g., in terms of competence frameworks [ 13, 24], formalized education programs [ 25], platform-based education [ 21, 31], the continuous education landscape [ 32], or even unlearning outdated competences [ 30].

Regarding the acquisition of digital talent, in contrast, the research stream is scarce. Most research we found during our review was focused on the digitalization of the recruitment process, for instance, with respect to ICT adoption [ 1], blockchain-based recruitment operations [ 42], the maturity of digitalized recruitment processes [ 23], or using AI in the recruitment process [ 28].

Digital talent and competences have primarily been examined in studies analyzing job advertisements to identify the competences sought by public organizations. For instance, Auth et al. (2021) [ 2] report a vanishingly low presence of digital government competences in job ads. Mankevich et al. (2023) [ 36] demonstrate that while public organizations have made progress in recent years, they continue to lag behind. Bellmer and Becker (2024) [ 5] highlight a predominant focus on computer operation skills.

Our article aims to carry this research stream further and answer the following research question: In  how  far  do  job  advertisements  contribute  to  acquiring digital  talent  for  German  public  organizations? Our contribution has three main aspects: First, we provide a detailed overview of digital government competencies currently sought by German public administrations, allowing us to draw conclusions about their HR practices related to digital talent recruitment. Second, we illustrate a novel approach to data collection and analysis.

We conduct a two-stage competence assessment by comparing an individual's competences to those required for a position, based on a competence model [ 15]. We conceptualize job ads as competence profiles for specific roles. We then compare these profiles against DigComp 2.2 [ 48], a widely recognized framework for digital competences [ 15]. We further integrate Large Language Model (LLM)assisted coding of categories to extract and analyze competences from job ads. This allows us to assess how well the competences listed in job ads align with the requirements specified in DigComp 2.2.

## 2 Research  Background

## 2.1 Digital  Government  Competence

Within the digital government body of knowledge, there is (at least to our knowledge) no generally accepted definition of what we understand as digital  government  competence . Broader conceptualizations of the competence concept divide competence into a visible layer and a hidden layer [ 10, 43]. The visible one depicts observable  behavior , that is, knowledge and skills. The hidden layer illustrates cognitive  mechanisms , that is, character traits, motives, and self-concept [ 10]. Both of these layers surface in digital government articles, whereby the visible layer [ 17, 24, 25] typically generates more interest than the hidden layer, where only a few articles acknowledge the importance of personality traits and cognitive mechanisms [ 13, 29].

Given the ambiguity of the concept, we align this article's efforts with a well-accepted competence model in many domains: the European Commission's DigComp 2.2 [ 48]. Although not specific to public administration, we consider the model suitable for our purposes for two reasons: first, its domain independence offers the potential for benchmarking -while domain-specific models [ 13, 24] give a deep dive into public administration requirements, we think the approach for data collection and analysis of our study works just as well for other domains, which is why a more open framework seems suitable. Second, DigComp 2.2 covers a range of competence areas and competences, that account for both the visible layer and the hidden layer of competence, making it suitable for a profound competence analysis. Thus, we draw on the same definition as suggested by the authors of DigComp 2.2 [ 48] and amend it by the public sector focus:

Digital  government  competence  involves  the  confident,  critical,  and  responsible  use  of  and  engagement  with  digital  technologies  for  learning  and  working  in a  digitally  transforming  public  sector.

On the highest level -which is also the focus of this article -, DigComp 2.2 posits five competence areas:

1. Information and data literacy: searching, evaluating, and managing digital data and content
2. Communication and collaboration: interacting and engaging by means of digital technologies, sharing information, and managing digital identities
3. Digital content creation: developing, and integrating digital content with respect to legal framework conditions; programming
4. Safety: Protecting devices, personal data, privacy, health- and well-being, and the environment
5. Problem solving: identifying and solving technical problems, creatively using digital technologies, and (self-)identifying digital competence gaps.

## 2.2 Recruitment  of  Digital  Talent  and  Job-Mining

Research on digital talent in the public sector is scarce, especially with a focus on recruitment. Given the importance of bringing in external talent for predigital organizations [ 20], this is surprising. Hence, we align with Mankevich et

al. and posit that 'digital transformation entails workforce transformation' [ 36, p. 412]. However, there is no widely accepted method to research competence proficiency across different organizations. To address this gap, we conceptualize job advertisements and the competencies they include as a way to understand the competences that are currently in demand within public organizations. This approach aligns with a recent trend in literature focused on job mining, which we aim to extend. Auth et al. (2021) [ 2] analyzed more than 21,000 German public sector job ads, attesting a vanishingly low share of digital government competences in total. Bellmer and Becker (2024) [ 5] checked 40 job advertisements and supplemented their findings with 13 qualitative interviews. They conclude that while many digital competences are mentioned, there remains a strong emphasis on basic computer operation skills. Mankevich et al. (2023) [ 36] explored a large open data set with Swedish job ads from 2006 to 2020 and determine that, albeit the interest in digital competences in these ads has risen, public organizations still lag behind the private sector's competence demands. We fully acknowledge the contributions of these articles; however, we decided to enhance the stream with an additional study for two main reasons. First, recent advancements in artificial intelligence allow us to utilize innovative methods for data collection and analysis supported by Large Language Models (LLMs). Job mining demonstrates the creative application of new technologies in research. Second, the ongoing developments in digital government continuously evolve, leading to a relatively short half-life for studies in this field. Therefore, our research not only validates previous work but also serves as a way to assess and incorporate new adaptations into the body of knowledge.

## 3 Research  Method

## 3.1 Foundations  of  Job  Mining

Our research methodology is derived from established job mining approaches. Since Internet-based job portals have become the standard tool for recruiting, the major share of public job advertisements is available online in a digital format. This opens up the possibility to investigate large amounts of job advertisements using text mining techniques [ 6]. The analytical process of job mining is derived from the classical data mining process [ 18] and described by Bensberg and Buscher in four steps: extraction, cleansing, linguistic pre-processing, and analysis [ 6]. The two pillars of job mining are therefore (1) the preparation of the text corpus and (2) the definition of the analytical process.

There are various options on how to collect the digital job ad text corpora. Job ads could be provided by the issuer, downloaded from databases, or scraped from online job portals. Cleansing usually involves filtering relevant records from the base population and removing duplicate or incomplete entries. Linguistic preprocessing refers to transforming and annotating parts of the text to make the text processable for traditional natural language processing (NLP) techniques. These techniques mainly rely on a statistical evaluation of text tokens and therefore require, e.g., tokenization, stemming, and part-of-speech tagging. LLMs are

trained to work with natural language and do not require any extensive of preprocessing.

The analysis part in job mining can aim at a variety of targets. A frequent goal is to assign categories to the job ads. These categories can reflect, e.g., types of jobs, geographical locations, salary, or skills and competences. The categories can be pre-defined or extracted from the corpus using algorithms such rake [ 40] or bert [ 49]. Researchers often use established clustering techniques for categorization, e.g. k-means [ 51, 52] or Latent  Dirichlet  Allocation [ 41, 52].

The advent of LLMs and their continuing development offer new opportunities in the processing of textual data. Up to now, LLMs have not been used explicitly to find competence categories in job ads. Gavrilescu et al. (2025) discuss the application of LLMs for skill extraction, but do not apply these themselves [ 19]. Other make use of the possibility to pre-train existing open-source LLMs in order to enable the models to categorize according to a certain qualifications taxonomy [ 3, 22, 34, 54]. However, this requires a labeled dataset, which is not the scope of our work.

There are works dealing with the categorization of texts in a more general context, not explicitly focusing on job ads [ 27, 45]. Assigning categories, labels, or topics to a text is in this context considered as qualitative coding. The classical approach to this is to define the rules for coding, usually in a codebook, and have human coders annotate the text [ 33]. This process can be transferred to an LLM-supported workflow. The coding instructions are composed of a prompt and a code book. The prompt is provided to an LLM along with the text that needs categorization [ 11, 45].

## 3.2 LLM-Supported  Job  Mining  with  Pre-Defined  Categories

The previous section shows that there are various possibilities for approaching the task of competence classification. With regard to our research design, we want to process a large number of job ads and apply the categorization from the chosen competence model without having to rely on existing training data. Consequently, our procedure is guided by the following considerations and requirements: (a) a large body of representative job advertisements, (b) easy accessibility to the job advertisements in a digital format, (c) based on an existing competence model, (d) no need for training nor the availability of labeled data, and (e) a comprehensible and explainable use of an LLM based on an established qualitative coding approach.

We adapt the Bensberg and Buscher job-mining model and update it to reflect our procedure [ 6]. Figure 1 illustrates the workflow of our analysis.

Request  Public  Service  Job  Ads: Public sector job advertisements are scattered across numerous online job portals. We have decided to collect the job ads from the German Federal Employment Agency. The reasons are: other public institutions report their vacancies to the agency, because it is a common public goal to increase the employment rate. In addition, the agency's online job portal has historically had the highest market share in the past in Germany [ 37].

Fig.  1. Job mining workflow: the top stream depicts the data acquisition and preparation part, the bottom stream shows the steps necessary to prepare the qualitative coding. Both parts can be prepared independently. The final steps on the right side describe coding and the final analysis of the results.

Finally, unlike private sector job portals, the agency offers unlimited access via an API [ 8], thus avoiding additional transformations of the text data.

Download  Job  Ads: A total number of 16,627 unique job ads from the category 'Public Sector' were downloaded between February 11 and 24, 2025.

Filter Relevant  Job  Ads: We filter the records for jobs in public administration with a specific search string in the 'profession' field to exclude irrelevant jobs such as police officer or maintenance worker. Internships and apprenticeships are also excluded. The remaining 5,949 job ads provide the input for the analysis.

Create  Codebook: The work of Chew et al. (2023) on LLM-assisted content analysis serves as template for the codebook and prompt design [ 11]. The first version of the codebook was composed using the literal description of five the DigComp areas [ 48, Fig. 1, p. 4]. However, preliminary tests showed poor and incomprehensible categorization results. A new version of the codebook contains more precise, manually crafted descriptions, including example texts 1 .

Create  Prompt: We develop a system prompt, also derived from Chew et al. The prompt describes the role of the LLM, the target, and the coding procedure. The codebook is provided to the LLM as part of the prompt. The coding procedure allows the LLM to assign the DigComp areas to a job ad. Just like manual coding, not only the category but also an explanation along with a quote from the text is documented. This ensures that humans can understand and verify the LLM's reasoning.

We introduce an additional measure to address potential categorization quality issues. Initially, categorization was binary: a category was either assigned or not. However, the LLM sometimes assigned categories while expressing doubts. Thus, we added a confidence  level to each output [ 53], documented as low (0), medium (1), or high (2), following instructions in the system prompt. This allows us to exclude low and medium confidence results from the analysis.

Fig.  2. Example JSON output. The German quotes are 'creation of technical construction reports' (first), and 'flexible working hours and the possibility of mobile working' (second).

Perform AI Coding: We send each job ad full text along with system prompt and codebook to the the API of the current version of mistral-largeinstruct (March 2025) hosted on a high performance computing infrastructure [ 14]. Although the analyzed texts are in German language, we designed the codebook and the prompts in English. The selection of the Mistral model was made on the basis of its explicit development as a model with multilingual capabilities, while still being among the top-ranked LLMs [ 26]. We did not observe any language-related problems in the results.

We utilize the structured output feature to constrain the LLM's response to a predefined format, ensuring it returns only a list of category assignments for each job ad. Each element includes a number from 1 to 5 for the DigComp area, an explanation with text reference, and a confidence level from 0 to 2. Figure 2 shows an example of the JSON output.

Produce  Report: As a result of the coding, each job ad will have zero, one, or more categories assigned to it. It is also possible for the same code to be assigned to different sections of the text.

In parallel to the LLM-assisted coding, a researcher manually coded a random sample of 50 job ads, following the same codebook and instructions, except for providing a confidence rating.

## 4 Results

## 4.1 Numerical  Results  From  LLM-Assisted  Coding

The first part of our analysis is an overview of how often each competence category is mentioned in the text corpus of 5,949 job advertisements. Figure 3 illustrates the findings. The bars show the frequency of occurrence for each category. Each bar is divided into three sections representing the confidence level

Fig.  3. Frequency of digital competences identified in job ad requirements by competence area and confidence level.

<!-- image -->

of the category identification. E.g., there are 2,676 hits in the category Information  and  Data  Literacy at confidence level high , an additional 991 hits at level medium , and 154 at level low .

Regarding our research question of how job ads contribute to the acquisition of digital talent, we now focus on job ads as the main object of observation. Therefore, we look at each job ad and determine which DigComp category is required at least once. The reason is that we want to know which digital competences are required at all, not at what intensity. However, the overall picture that emerges from the overall count is similar in percentage terms. The percentage of job advertisements that require a particular digital competence at least once is shown in Fig. 4.

Digital  Content  Creation and Information  and  Data  Literacy are the most requested categories. More than 60% of the job ads ask for competences in Digital  Content  Creation , and approximately 50% ask for competence in Information  and  Data  Literacy . Moreover, these two categories exhibit a dominant share of categorizations at a high confidence level. In contrast, Communication and  Collaboration and Problem  Solving have approximately two thirds of their categorizations at medium or low confidence levels. Interestingly, Safety has only a marginal number of mentions in the job ads. It is also noteworthy that, if we only consider assignments at a high confidence level (thus neglecting competences deduced from statements rather vaguely related to digital topics), 19.4% of the job ads mention no digital competences at all.

## 4.2 Comparison  to  Manual  Coding

The manual coding results are processed in the same fashion as the LLM results. Figure 5 is the manual coding counterpart to Fig. 4. The percentage of DigComp category assignment is comparable to the percentage at a high confidence level. The only exception is Communication  and  Collaboration , which was identified more often by the human coder.

Table 1 shows multilabel classification performance metrics for the three different cumulative confidence levels with the manual coding assumed as the ground truth. Due to the imbalanced distribution in some categories, the combined metrics F1  score , Area  under  the  Curve  (AUC) , and Cohen's  Kappa can be considered as the most relevant metrics. The F1 score balances precision and recall to provide a single measure of a model's accuracy, while the AUC

<!-- image -->

evaluates the overall ability of the model to discriminate between classes. F1 score and AUC are mainly used to evaluate classification algorithms in machine learning [ 38], while Cohen's  Kappa often serves as an indicator of inter-coder agreement among multiple human coders in qualitative analysis [ 44]. The metrics show moderate consensus.

## 5 Discussion

## 5.1 The  Role  of  Digital  Competences  in  Job  Advertisements

The discussion is guided by our main research question about the contribution of job advertisements to the acquisition of digital talent for German public organizations. Our results show that digital competences as defined by DigComp 2.2 are present in job ads in the public sector. As one could expect, working with data ( Information  and  Data  Literacy ) and Digital  Content  Creation are the most common. Our interpretation is that these categories are the best fit general need for computer literacy, which can be formulated more in terms of research and information processing (and thus referring to the first category) or in the direction of writing documents and spreadsheets (referring to the latter category).

Despite the perceived transition to online collaboration and remote work after the period of the COVID pandemic, Communication  and  Collaboration does not play a prominent role in the job ads investigated. In fact, if we consider only the high-confidence assignments, the rate is less than 20%. Another striking observation is the extremely low rate for competences in Safety , which is at 3.7%. This raises the question how aware public organizations are of this issues in times of

orchestrated cyber attacks and social engineering attempts on companies, universities, hospitals, and government institutions. The Problem  Solving category has very few mentions as well. However, we hypothesize that this is due to the rather conceptual nature of this competence category and therefore not clearly expressed in job ads.

It seems counterintuitive: German public administration is seen as urgently needing digital transformation success. Why, then, is the share of job ads requiring digital competencies so low? Studies show that public sector job ads rarely explicitly mention digital competencies. References to digital skills often pertain to basic computer operation or familiarity with office and subject-specific software [ 5]. Recruiters might assume all candidates, especially younger ones, possess sufficient digital skills or that these are covered by other job requirements, such as educational qualifications. Additionally, there may still be a division of labor regarding IT tasks, with organizations believing digital transformation should be handled by IT experts, not the administrative staff targeted by these job ads.

In any case, we conclude that there is a digital competence shortfall in public sector job advertisements in Germany. If it is intended to increase the amount of digital talent in the public administration, the required digital competences need to be named unambiguously in job descriptions and job advertisements.

## 5.2 LLM-Assisted  Coding  as  Method  for Identification of  Competences  in  Job  Advertisements

The method of LLM-assisted coding can be seen as a big leap in the field of qualitative analysis in general and in job mining in particular. Observing the demand side of the job market is a crucial factor in understanding its dynamics and challenges. Our approach overcomes the tedious manual analysis of large amounts of text. It is more flexible in contrast to classical NLP approaches based on statistical evaluation of word frequencies.

Three components make the LLM-assisted coding versatile, comprehensible, and to a certain extent reproducible: (a) system prompt and codebook can be adapted to to suit the particular needs of the categorization process, (b) supplementary explanatory output such as text references and confidence levels enhance the transparency of the results, and (c) the predefined structured output defines the results more precisely.

It is noteworthy that the comparison to a human coder exhibits only mediocre consensus, as documented in Sect. 4.2. However, we do not perceive this as a fundamental problem of the methodology. Instead, we want to highlight LLMassisted coding as an exciting opportunity for human-AI collaboration. In this approach, both the AI agent and the human work together to develop a shared understanding of the data being analyzed. This partnership enables them to provide qualitative analysis of large data sets efficiently and at scale. The machine learning metrics are predicated on the assumption that there is a 'true' category for each job ad, and the metrics demonstrate the extent to which the LLMassisted procedure aligns with this 'true' category. Due to the ambiguity of the job ads with regard to digital competences, both the human coder as well as the

LLM may encounter challenges in assigning the categories. By working together, they will likely identify patterns more easily and continuously enhance the coding process. This is particularly relevant, because two independent human coders can also diverge in their assignment of codes while at the same time the similarity of the overall share of competences (Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, with the exception of Communication  and  Collaboration ) indicates that the LLM and the human coder have a similar perception of the distribution of digital competences in the observed job ads.

## 6 Limitations  and  Conclusion

We've processed 5,949 job ads so far. Future work could involve higher volumes to bolster results. Currently, data collection is limited to one platform, and further research could assess its representativeness for the public sector, including the filter for relevant job descriptions.

The codebook and system prompt were systematically designed, yet coding DigComp categories relies on expert knowledge, allowing for potential variations and improvements. Using an LLM lacks reproducibility in a narrow sense and may hallucinate. Concerns have been raised about ethical and cultural challenges and potential deskilling of researchers with over-reliance on LLMs in qualitative research [ 39].

Our results confirm previous studies that digital competences are rarely stated explicitly as requirements. With regard to the postulated urgency of digital transformation in the public sector, the concrete mention of versatile digital competences in job ads remains sparse. In particular, demand for competences in safety, such as protecting data and devices, is barely found, similarly to the also infrequent demand for competences in digital communication and collaboration. Our conclusion for necessary consequences in HR management in public sector is: If you  want  digital  talent,  you  have  to  ask  for it .

From a methodology perspective, we have introduced a novel and streamlined approach to data collection and analysis. The approach has proven to be efficient and useful to boost qualitative research in this field. At the same time we see the need to accompany this automated approach by human expertise in all phases of the process and we emphasize awareness about the challenges that come with the use of Large Language Models. In summary, we have extended the possibilities of established job mining procedures and encourage other researchers to build on this foundation. While our sample was taken from the German labor market, the methodology is universally applicable across all LLM-supported languages, allowing the digital government job mining research domain has the potential to be brought together on a global level.
