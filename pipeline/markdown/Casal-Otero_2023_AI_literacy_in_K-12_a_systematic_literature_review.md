## Abstract

The successful irruption of AI-based technology in our daily lives has led to a growing educational, social, and political interest in training citizens in AI. Education systems now need to train students at the K-12 level to live in a society where they must interact with AI. Thus, AI literacy is a pedagogical and cognitive challenge at the K-12 level. This study aimed to understand how AI is being integrated into K-12 education worldwide. We conducted a search process following the systematic literature review method using Scopus. 179 documents were reviewed, and two broad groups of AI literacy approaches were identified, namely learning experience and theoretical perspective. The first group covered experiences in learning technical, conceptual and applied skills in a particular domain of interest. The second group revealed that significant efforts are being made to design models that frame AI literacy proposals. There were hardly any experiences that assessed whether students understood AI concepts after the learning experience. Little attention has been paid to the undesirable consequences of an indiscriminate and insufficiently thought-out application of AI. A competency framework is required to guide the didactic proposals designed by educational institutions and define a curriculum reflecting the sequence and academic continuity, which should be modular, personalized and adjusted to the conditions of the schools. Finally, AI literacy can be leveraged to enhance the learning of disciplinary core subjects by integrating AI into the teaching process of those subjects, provided the curriculum is co-designed with teachers.

## Introduction

In  recent  years,  the  convergence  of  huge  computing power, massive amounts of data and improved machine learning  algorithms  have  led  to  remarkable  advances  in Artificial Intelligence (AI) based technologies, which are

set  to  be  the  most  socially  and  economically  disruptive technologies  ever  developed  (Russell,  2021).  The  irruption of AI-based technology in our daily lives (e.g., robot vacuum cleaners, real-time location and search systems, virtual  assistants,  etc.)  has  generated  a  growing  social and political interest in educating citizens about AI. The scientific  community  has  also  begun  to  engage  in  this education after detecting a significant gap in the understanding of AI, based on comments and fears expressed by citizens about this technology (West &amp; Allen, 2018). Therefore,  integrating  AI  into  curricula  is  necessary  to train  citizens  who  must  increasingly  live  and  act  in  a world with a significant presence of AI.

It  is  worth  noting  that  AI  education  addresses  not only  the  learning  of  the  scientific  and  technological

foundations  of  AI,  but  also  the  knowledge  and  critical reflection on how a trustworthy AI should be developed and the consequences of not doing so. Hence, it is crucial  to  incorporate  AI  teaching  from  the  earliest  stages of  education  (Heintz,  2021).  However,  although  some countries  are  making  significant  efforts  to  promote  AI teaching  in  K-12  (Touretzky  et  al.,  2019a),  this  is  being implemented  through  highly  varied  AI  training  experiences, such as data-driven design (Vartiainen et al., 2021), interactive data visualizations (Chittora &amp; Baynes, 2020; von Wangenheim et al., 2021), virtual reality and robotics (Narahara &amp; Kobayashi, 2018), games (Giannakos et al., 2020), or even based on combined workshop series (Lee et al., 2021). To date, there are very few methodological proposals on how to introduce the AI curriculum in K-12 education (Lee et al., 2020).

Since the development of a field requires prior research, we propose in this paper to identify and examine the way in  which  AI  literacy  is  developing  in  K-12  around  the world,  to  draw  conclusions  and  guide  teaching  proposals for AI literacy in K-12. By highlighting and discussing the pros and cons of the different approaches and experiences in the literature, we aim to inspire new initiatives and guide the actors involved, from decisions-makers, for example in education policy, to teachers involved in their conception, design and implementation. We also hope to raise  awareness  of  the  importance  of  learning  about  AI from  an  early  age,  emphasizing  the  key  aspects  of  this training and, hopefully, fueling the debate that needs to be fostered in our research community.

## Integration of AI into the K12 curriculum

As  a  scientific-technological  field,  AI  is  just  a  few  decades old. The name was coined in 1956, and since then different  disciplines  (such  as  computer  science,  mathematics,  philosophy,  neuroscience,  or  psychology)  have contributed to its development from an interdisciplinary focus. AI is oriented to comprehend, model, and replicate human intelligence and cognitive processes into artificial systems.  Currently,  it  covers  a  wide  range  of  subfields such  as  machine  learning,  perception,  natural  language processing, knowledge  representation  and  reasoning, computer vision, among many others (Russell &amp; Norvig, 2021).

Starting  in  the  1970s,  AI  began  to  emerge  in  educational  contexts  through  tools  specifically  designed  to support learning, teaching, and the management of educational institutions. Since many jobs are now AI-related and will continue to increase in the coming years, some researchers  believe  that  AI  education  should  be  considered  as  important  as  literacy  in  reading  and  writing (Kandlhofer  et  al.,  2016).  The  highly  interdisciplinary character  is  also  another  factor  to  consider.  AI  literacy can be defined as a set of skills that enable a solid understanding  of  AI  through  three  priority  axes:  learning about AI, learning about how AI works, and learning for life  with  AI  (Long  &amp;  Magerko, 2020; Miao et al., 2021). The first axis focuses on understanding AI concepts and techniques to enable the recognition of which artifacts/ platforms  use  AI  and  which  do  not.  The  second  axis addresses the understanding of how AI works, to effectively interact with it. The third axis seeks to understand how AI can affect our lives, allowing us to critically evaluate its technology. Thus, AI literacy goes beyond the use of AI applications in education, such as Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) (du Boulay, 2016).

The  teaching  of  knowledge  in  AI  has  traditionally been carried out at the university level, focused on students  who  study  disciplines  closely  related  to  computing and ICT in general. In recent years, AI learning has also  started  to  be  relevant  both  in  university  programs with  diverse  study  backgrounds  (Kong  et  al.,  2021),  as well as at the K-12 level (Kandlhofer &amp; Steinbauer, 2021; Tedre  et  al.,  2021).  However,  teaching  AI  at  the  K-12 level is not yet prevalent in formal settings and is considered challenging. Experts believe it is important to have some thought on what AI education should look like at the  K-12  level  so  that  future  generations  can  become informed citizens who understand the technologies they interact with in their daily lives (Touretzky et al., 2019a). Training  children and  teenagers  will  allow  them  to understand the basics of the science and technology that underpins AI, its possibilities, its limits and its potential social and economic impact. It also stimulates and better prepares them to pursue further studies related to AI or even to become creators and developers of AI themselves (Heintz, 2021).

Nowadays,  research  on  AI  teaching  is  still  scarce (Chai et al., 2020a, 2020b; Lee et al., 2020). The acquisition of knowledge in AI represents a great pedagogical challenge for both experts and teachers, and a cognitive challenge  for  students  (Micheuz,  2020).  Some  countries are making significant efforts to promote AI education in K-12 (Touretzky et al., 2019b), by developing relatively  comprehensive  curriculum  guidelines  (Yue et al., 2021). Through interviews with practitioners and policy  makers  from  three  different  continents  (America,  Asia  and  Europe),  some  studies  report  on  continuing  works  to  introduce  AI  in  K-12  education  (He et  al.,  2020).  Some  other  work  focuses  on  examining and  comparing  AI  curricula  in  several  countries  (Yue et al., 2021). In addition, there are a growing number of AI training experiences that explore pathways to optimize AI learning for K-12 students. However, most of them are somehow thematically limited as they do not adequately  address  key  areas  of  AI,  such  as  planning,

knowledge  representation  and  automated  reasoning (Nisheva-Pavlova, 2021). Additionally, due to the rapid growth of AI, there is a need to understand how educators  can  best  leverage  AI  techniques  for  the  academic success of their students. Zhai et al. (2021) recommend that educators work together with AI experts to bridge the gap between technique and pedagogy.

Using a systematic review method, our research aims to present an overview of current approaches to understand how AI is taught worldwide. Several studies have conducted systematic  reviews  concerning  applications of  AI  in  education.  Zhai  et  al.  (2021)  analyzed  how AI was applied to the education domain from 2010 to 2020. Their review covers research on AI-based learning  environments,  from  their  construction  to  their application and integration in the educational environment. Guan et al. (2020) reviewed the main themes and trends  in  AI  research  in  education  over  the  past  two decades. The authors found that research on the use of AI techniques to support teaching or learning has stood the  test  of  time  and  that  learner  profiling  models  and learning analytics have proliferated in the last two decades. Ng et al. (2022) examined learner types, teaching tools  and  pedagogical  approaches  in  AI  teaching  and learning, mainly in university computer science education. Chen et al. (2020) covered education enhanced by AI techniques aimed to back up teaching and learning. All these studies have focused on the main role that AI has played in educational applications over the last decades. However, in light of the recent need to consider how  AI  education  should  be  approached  at  the  K-12 level  (Kandlhofer  et  al.,  2016;  Long  &amp;  Magerko,  2020; Miao et al., 2021; Touretzky et al., 2019b), it would be of  great  value  to  structure  and  characterize  the  different  approaches  used  so  far  to  develop  AI  literacy  in K-12, as well as to identify research gaps to be explored. Recently,  Yue  et  al.  (2022)  analyzed  the  main  components of the pedagogical design in 32 empirical studies in K-12 AI education and Su et al. (2022) examined 14 learning  experiences  carried  out  in  the  Asian-Pacific region.  These  components  included  target  audience, setting,  duration,  contents,  pedagogical  approaches  to teaching, and assessment methods. Sanusi et al. (2022) reviewed  research  on  teaching  machine  learning  in K-12 from four perspectives: curriculum development, technology development, pedagogical development, and teacher training development. The findings of the study  revealed  that  more  studies  are  needed  on  how to integrate machine learning into subjects other than computer  science.  Crompton  et  al.  (2022)  carried  out a  systematic  review  on  the  use  of  AI  as  a  supporting tool in K-12 teaching, which entails an interesting but narrower  scope.  Our  study  extends  previous  reviews on  K-12  AI  research  by  emphasizing  how  the  current approaches  are  integrating  AI  literacy  in  K-12  education worldwide.

## Research question

To begin the systematic review, a single research question (RQ) was formulated.

RQ: How are current approaches integrating AI literacy into K-12 education worldwide?

In essence, the RQ aims to investigate the characterization of the different approaches being employed to incorporate AI education in K-12. The following subsections in the methodology describe the search and the data collection process in such a way that an answer to the RQ can be provided in a replicable and objective fashion.

## Methods

The  research  method  chosen  to  conduct  this  research was the systematic literature review (SLR), following the guidelines posed by Kitchenham (2004). Accordingly, the following subsections summarize and document the key steps implemented in this research method.

## Search process

We used Scopus to  implement  the  search  process.  Scopus  provides  an  integrated  search  facility  to  find  relevant papers in its database based on curated metadata. It  includes  primary  bibliographic  sources  published  by Elsevier , Springer , ACM ,  and IEEE ,  among  others.  It provides a comprehensive coverage of journals and topranked conferences within fields of interest. We did not limit our search to specific journals or regular conference proceedings, as there is not yet a clearly established body of literature on the subject. All searches were performed based  on  title,  keywords  and  abstract,  and  conducted between 21 October 2021 and 9 March 2023.

To decide the search string, we ran an initial search and found only a few papers focused on 'literacy' whereas the vast  majority  referred  to  the  broader  term  'education' . Therefore, we decided to use both search terms (key issue 1 in Table 1). As some recent works combine the terms ' Artificial  Intelligence'  and  'education'/'literacy'  into  single terms such as 'AI literacy' or ' AI education' , these were added to the search string (key issue 2 in Table 1). The educational stage was also included in the search string (key  issue  3  in  Table  1).  As  the  search  term  'education' also  returns  AI-based  learning  environments  which  are outside the scope of our review, we explicitly considered negated terms to leave out both computer-based learning and intelligent tutoring systems (key issue 4 in Table 1). A final  decision  was  whether  to  use  the  term  ' Artificial

Intelligence'  as  a  single  umbrella  term  or  to  add  narrower terms related to AI subfields (e.g., machine learning).  After  a  preliminary  inspection  of  a  few  relevant papers, we observed that such additional specific terms usually co-occur with the string 'Artificial Intelligence' in education, and they were therefore regarded as unnecessary. Thus, to capture the essence of our RQ and to build up the complete search string, we considered the search terms as shown in Table 1. Eventually, this resulted in the following complete search string in Scopus:

TITLE-ABS-KEY ( ( ( ( literacy OR education) AND ( (  artificial AND intelligence))) OR ( "AI literacy" OR "AI education"))  AND  (  "primary  school"  OR  "secondary school" OR k-12 OR "middle school"

OR "high school") AND NOT ( "computer-based learning") AND NOT ( "intelligent tutoring system")).

We included  peer-reviewed  papers  published  on  topics related to literacy and education on AI at school. Then we excluded papers whose usage of AI was limited to 1) supporting computer-based learning only, with no focus on  learning  about  AI;  2)  supporting  assessment/tutoring based on AI. We also excluded papers that targeted college  students  and  those  that  were  limited  to  K-12 programming/CS  concepts  as  a  prerequisite  for  learning about AI in the future. Following these inclusion and exclusion criteria, our search in Scopus returned an initial  list  of  750  documents.  After  we  inspected  the  title, abstract, keywords and full-text screening, we obtained a final list of 179 documents.

## Data collection extraction and synthesis strategy

Data  collection  extraction  was  performed,  discussed, and coordinated through regular meetings. After inspecting and discussing 10% of the papers over multiple  meetings,  the  authors  agreed  on  the  annotations presented  in  Table  2.  This  process  is  important  as  it allowed  us  to  build  a  data  annotation  scheme  empirically emerging from the sampled papers. A copy of the papers was also kept for easy review in case of doubts or disagreements.

The data resulted in a spreadsheet with the metadata of  the  papers  which  passed  the  inclusion  and  exclusion criteria, and a document with the list of paper IDs together  with  the  rest  of  annotations.  Some  Python scripts  were  used  to  further  process  metadata  (e.g., counting participating countries, frequencies, etc.) and produce  a  more  complete  bibliographic  report  with histograms and overview counting. A more qualitative analysis  was  carried  out  to  answer  the  research  question based on paper reading and annotations.

## Results

The results were organized into two subsections. The  first  subsection  is  a  bibliometric  analysis  of  the reviewed studies, which is based on the metadata provided  by  Scopus.  The  second  subsection  provides  a qualitative analysis of the studies, which is based on the


<!-- PAGE 5 -->


## Papers per year

extracted data annotations (see Table 2). Both analyses are complementary and together deliver a better understanding of the research articles retrieved.

## Bibliometric analysis

Figure 1 shows that the annual scientific production has been  modest.  It  gained  traction  in  2016  and  increased sharply in 2020.

Most of the contributions are conference publications (126  papers),  while  52  are  journal  articles  and  one  is  a book chapter (Fig. 2).

Eighty out of 179 papers have at least a citation in Scopus. There are 13 papers that have 10 or more citations, and the most cited papers are Long and Magerko (2020) and  Touretzky  et  al.  (2019b).  Figure  3  summarizes  the number of contributions by publishers, where Springer, IEEE  and  ACM  stand  out,  followed  by  Elsevier.  As  for journals,  there  are  no  single  journals  concentrating  the publication  of  articles.  Nevertheless,  there  are  some journals  that  are  especially  relevant  and  well-known by  the  community  such  as  the  International  Journal  of Child-Computer Interaction, Computers  and  Education: Artificial Intelligence, International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, or IEEE Transactions on Education.

As for conferences, Fig. 4 summarizes the main conference events where papers are published. It includes flagship  conferences 1 such  as  CHI  and  AAAI,  top-ranked

1  1 Conference  categorization  and  ranking  based  on  the  GII-GRIN-SCIE (GGS) Conference Ratings: https://  scie.  lcc.  uma.  es/

conferences  such  as  HRI  or  SIGCSE  and  several  noteworthy events (IDC, ICALT, ITiCSE, VL/HCC, to name a  few).  It  is  worth  mentioning  that  AAAI  is  receiving contributions  from  recent  years,  which  confirms  the interest in the field in broadening the discussion to education.  There  are  some  additional  publications  associated  with  satellite  AAAI  events,  such  as  workshops  in CEUR-WS that deal with the issue under study. Although such contributions may sometimes be short, we decided to include them as they were relevant. For instance, the works published in (Herrero et al., 2020) and (Micheuz, 2020) include the German countrywide proposal for educating about AI, through a 6-module course focusing on explaining how AI works, the social discourse on AI and reducing  existing  misconceptions.  On  the  other  hand, Aguar et al. (2016) talk about teaching AI via an optional course which does not contribute to the final grades.

The  analysis  did  not  reveal  particularly  outstanding institutions (see Table 3 for a summary). Among the 299 affiliated  institutions,  we  mostly  find  universities  and research centers along with a few collaboration associations. The most active institutions are the Chinese University of Hong Kong, University of Eastern Finland and MIT, whose authors participated in a total of 19, 11 and 10 contributions, respectively.

Finally,  the  retrieved  papers  were  co-authored  by  643 different  authors  affiliated  to  research  institutions  from 42 countries. Figure 5 shows the histogram of participation by country. Of the 179 papers reviewed, most papers were written by authors affiliated with institutions in the same country. Only 32 papers involved authors from several countries. It is remarkable that in these cases at least one author is from the US, Hong Kong or China.

## Literature analysis

By analyzing the data extracted, the papers were classified into two broad thematic categories according to the type  of  educational  approach,  namely,  learning  experience and theoretical perspective. The first category covers AI learning experiences focused on understanding a particular  AI  concept/technique or using specific tools/ platforms  to  illustrate  some  AI  concepts.  The  second category involves initiatives for the implementation of AI education  for  K-12  through  the  development  of  guidelines,  curriculum  design  or  teacher  training,  among others. Each main category was further subdivided into other subcategories to structure the field and characterize the different approaches used in developing AI literacy in K-12. Figure 6 shows all the identified categories and subcategories.

## Learning experiences focused on understanding AI

This category covers learning experiences aimed  at experimenting and becoming familiar with AI concepts and techniques. Based on the priority axes in AI literacy (Long  &amp;  Magerko,  2020;  Miao  et  al.,  2021),  we  identified experiences aimed at acquiring basic AI knowledge to  recognize  artifacts  using  AI,  learning  how  AI  works, learning tools for AI and learning to live with AI.

## Learning to recognize artifacts using AI

This subcategory refers to experiences that aim to understand  AI  concepts  and  techniques  enabling  the  recognition  of  which  artifacts/platforms  use  AI  and  which do  not.  Four  studies  were  found  in  this  subcategory. They  are  proposals  aimed  at  helping  young  people  to understand and demystify AI through different types of

activities.  These  activities  included  conducting  discussions after watching AI-related movies (Tims et al., 2012), carrying out computer-based simulations of human-like behaviors (Ho et al., 2019), experimenting as active users of social robots (Gonzalez et al., 2017) and programming AI-based  conversational  agents  (Van  Brummelen  et  al., 2021b).

## Learning about how AI works

This topic covers proposals designed to understand how AI  works  to  make  user  interaction  with  AI  easier  and more effective.  In  this  type  of  proposal,  the  focus  is  on methodology and learning is achieved through technology (Kim et al., 2023). The objective is to provide a better understanding of a particular aspect of reality in order to carry out a project or solve a problem (Lenoir &amp; Hasni, 2016). The activities are supported by active experiences based  on  building  and  creating  intelligent  devices  to achieve the understanding of AI concepts following the idea of Papert's constructionism.

These  experiences  are  mainly  focused  on  teaching  AI subfields such as ML or AI algorithms applied to robotics.  Understanding  the  principles  of  ML,  its  workflows and its role in everyday practices to solve real-life problems has been the main objective of some studies (Burgsteiner  et  al.,  2016;  Evangelista  et  al.,  2019;  Lee  et  al., 2020;  Sakulkueakulsuk  et  al.,  2019;  Vartiainen  et  al., 2021).  In  addition,  there  are  also  experiences  focused on unplugged activities that simulate AI algorithms. For

example,  through  classic  games  such  as  Mystery  Hunt, one can learn how to traverse a graph without being able to see beyond the next path to be traversed (blind search)

(Kandlhofer et al., 2016). Similarly, the AI4K12 initiative (Touretzky et al., 2019b) collects a large set of activities and resources to simulate AI algorithms.

## Learning tools for AI

This  topic  includes  approaches  that  involve  learning about  AI  support  tools.  The  development  of  intelligent devices  in  the  context  of  teaching  AI  requires  specific programming languages or age-appropriate tools. Many of the tools currently available are focused on ML, with the aim of demystifying this learning in K-12 education (Wan  et  al.,  2020).  Some  of  them  are  integrated  into block-based  programming  languages  (such  as  Scratch or  App  Inventor)  (Toivonen  et  al.,  2020;  von  Wangenheim  et  al.,  2021),  enabling  the  deployment  of  the  ML models  built  into  games  or  mobile  applications.  Other approaches use data visualization and concepts of gamification  to  engage  the  student  in  the  learning  process (Reyes  et  al.,  2020;  Wan  et  al.,  2020)  or  combine  traditional  programming  activities  with  ML  model  building (Rodríguez-García et al., 2020).

This  type  of  proposal  aims  to  introduce  AI  through tools that enable the use of AI techniques. It is therefore an  approach  focused  on  learning  by  using  AI-oriented tools.  In  this  vein,  different  experiences  have  focused on  learning  programming  tools  for  applications  based on  Machine  Learning  (Reyes  et  al.,  2020;  Toivonen et  al.,  2020;  von  Wangenheim  et  al.,  2021;  Wan  et  al., 2020), robotics (Chen et al., 2017; Eguchi, 2021; Eguchi &amp; Okada, 2020; Holowka, 2020; Narahara &amp; Kobayashi, 2018;  Nurbekova  et  al.,  2018;  Verner  et  al.,  2021),  programming and  the  creation  of  applications  (Chittora  &amp; Baynes, 2020; Giannakos et al., 2020; Kahn et al., 2018; Kelly et al., 2008; Park et al., 2021). Some of these tools use  Scratch-based  coding  platforms  to  make  AI-based programming  attractive  to  children.  In  (Kahn  et  al., 2018),  students  play  around  with  machine  learning  to classify self-captured images, using a block-based coding platform.

There  are  also  experiences  in  which  other  types  of environments are used to facilitate learning (Aung et al., 2022).  In  (Holowka,  2020;  Verner  et  al.,  2021),  students can learn reinforcement learning through online simulation. In (Narahara &amp; Kobayashi, 2018), a virtual environment  helps  students  generate  data  in  a  playful  setting, which  is  then  used  to  train  a  neural  network  for  the autonomous driving of a toy car-lab. In (Avanzato, 2009; Croxell  et  al.,  2007),  students  experiment  with  different AI-based tasks through robotics-oriented competitions.

## Learning for life with AI

This  subcategory  covers  experiences  aimed  at  understanding  how  AI  can  affect  our  lives  thus  providing  us with skills  to  critically  assess  its  technology.  In  (Vachovsky  et  al.,  2016),  technically  rigorous  AI  concepts  are contextualized through the impact on society. There are also  experiences  where  students  explore  how  a  robot equipped  with  AI  components  can  be  used  in  society (Eguchi &amp; Okada, 2018), program conversational agents (Van  Brummelen  et  al.,  2021b),  or  learn  to  recognize credible but fake media products (video, photos), which have been generated using AI-based techniques (2021b; Ali et al., 2021a).

The ethical  and  philosophical  implications  of  AI  have also  been  addressed  in  some  experiences  (2021b;  Ali et  al.,  2021a;  Ellis  et  al.,  2005),  whereas  others  focus  on training  students  to  participate  in  present-day  society and  become  critical  consumers  of  AI  (Alexandre  et  al., 2021; Cummings et al., 2021; Díaz et al., 2015; Kaspersen et al., 2022; Lee et al., 2021; Vartiainen et al., 2020).

## Proposals for implementation of AI learning at the K-12 level

Some countries  are  making  efforts  to  promote  AI  education in K-12. In the U.S., intense work is being carried out on the integration of AI in schools and among these schemes, AI4K12 stands out (Heintz, 2021). This scheme is  especially  interesting  since  it  defines  the  national guidelines for future curricula, highlighting the essential collaborative work between developers, teachers and students (Touretzky et al.,  2019a).  This  idea  of  co-creation is  also  stressed  in  other  schemes  (Chiu,  2021).  In  the U.S. we can also mention the proposal made by the Massachusetts  Institute  of  Technology,  which  is  an  AI  curriculum that aims to engage students with its social and ethical  implications  (Touretzky  et  al.,  2019a).  Although the United States is working intensively on the design of integrating this knowledge into the curriculum, so far AI is not widely offered in most K-12 schools (Heintz, 2021).

In  China,  the  Ministry  of  Education  has  integrated AI  into  the  compulsory  secondary  school  curriculum (Ottenbreit-Leftwich  et  al.,  2021;  Xiao  &amp;  Song,  2021). Among  their  schemes  we  can  reference  the  AI4Future  initiative  of  the  Chinese  University  of  Hong  Kong (CUHK),  which  promotes  the  co-creation  process  to implement  AI  education  (Chiu  et  al.,  2021).  In  Singapore, a program for AI learning in schools has also been developed,  where  K-12  children  learn  AI  interactively. However,  the  program  is  hindered  by  a  lack  of  professionals (teachers) with adequate training (Heintz, 2021). In  Germany,  there  are  also  several  initiatives  to  pilot AI-related projects and studies (Micheuz, 2020), including the launch of a national initiative to teach a holistic view of AI. This initiative consists of a 6-module course aimed at  explaining  how  AI  works,  stimulating  a  social discourse on AI and clarifying the abundant existing misconceptions (Micheuz, 2020). Canada has also designed an  AI  course  for  high  schools.  The  course  is  intended to  empower  students  with  knowledge  about  AI,  covering both its philosophical and conceptual underpinnings

as  well  as  its  practical  aspects.  The  latter  are  achieved by  building  AI  projects  that  solve  real-life  problems (Nisheva-Pavlova, 2021).

The literature  also  highlights  the  different  approaches that  AI  literacy  should  focus  on:  curriculum  design, AI  subject  design,  student  perspective,  teacher  training,  resource  design  and  gender  diversity.  All  these approaches are described in depth below.

## AI literacy curriculum design

Approaches  to  curriculum  development  differ  widely, ranging  from  the  product-centered  model  (technicalscientific  perspective)  to  the  process-centered  model (learner perspective) (Yue et al., 2021). AI literacy can be launched in primary and secondary education depending on the age and computer literacy of the students. To do this, it is necessary to define the core competencies for AI literacy  according  to  three  dimensions:  AI  concepts,  AI applications and AI ethics and security (Long &amp; Magerko, 2020;  Wong  et  al.,  2020).  Research  has  focused  on  the understanding  of  the  concepts,  the  functional  roles  of AI, and the development of problem-solving skills (Woo et  al.,  2020).  This  has  led  to  proposing  a  redefinition  of the curriculum (Han et al., 2019; Malach &amp; Vicherková, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020) supported by different ideas that K-12  students  should  know  (Chiu  et  al.,  2021;  Sabuncuoglu,  2020;  Touretzky  et  al.,  2019b).  Several  countries have  already  made  different  curricular  proposals  (Alexandre et al., 2021; Micheuz, 2020; Nisheva-Pavlova, 2021; Ottenbreit-Leftwich et al., 2021; Touretzky et al., 2019b; Xiao &amp; Song, 2021), where they argue that the curricular  design  must  include  different  elements  such  as  content, product, process and praxis (Chiu, 2021). It is also convenient for learning in AI to follow the computational thinking  model  (Shin,  2021),  contextualizing  the  proposed curriculum (Eguchi et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2020) and providing it with the necessary resources for teachers (Eguchi et al., 2021). In this sense, emerging initiatives highlight  the  need  to  involve  teachers  in  the  process  of co-creating a curriculum associated to their context (Barlex et al., 2020; Chiu et al., 2021; Dai et al., 2023; Lin &amp; Brummelen, 2021; Yau et al., 2022).

## AI as a subject in K-12 education

Traditionally,  including  computer  science  or  new  technologies in the educational system has been carried out through a specific subject integrated into the curriculum or through the offer of extracurricular activities. In this sense, different proposals have suggested the integration of  AI  as  a  subject  in  K-12  education  (Ellis  et  al.,  2009; Knijnenburg et al., 2021; Micheuz, 2020; Sperling &amp; Lickerman,  2012),  in  short-term  courses  (around  15  h)  and divided  into  learning  modules  focused  on  classical  and modern AI (Wong, 2020) or through MOOCs (Alexandre et al., 2021).

## Student perspective on AI Literacy

Student-focused  studies  explore  and  analyze  attitudes and previous knowledge to make didactic proposals  adapted  to  the  learner.  Some  of  them  measure  their intention and interest in learning AI (Bollin et al., 2020; Chai  et  al.,  2021,  2020a,  2020b;  Gao  &amp;  Wang,  2019; Harris et al., 2004; Sing, et al., 2022; Suh &amp; Ahn, 2022), whereas others discuss their views on the integration of technologies in the education system (Sorensen &amp; Koefoed, 2018) and on teaching-learning support tools in AI (Holstein et al., 2019).

## Teacher training in AI

Teachers are key players for the integration of AI literacy in K-12, as proven by the numerous studies that examine this issue (An et al., 2022; Bai &amp; Yang, 2019; Chiu &amp; Chai, 2020; Chiu et al., 2021; Chounta et al., 2021; Judd, 2020; Kandlhofer et al., 2019, 2021; Kim et al., 2021; Korenova, 2016; Lin et al., 2022; Lindner &amp; Berges, 2020; Oh, 2020; Summers et al., 1995; Wei et al.,  2020;  Wu  et  al.,  2020; Xia &amp; Zheng, 2020). This approach places teachers at the center, bearing in mind what they need to know so as to integrate AI into K-12 (Itmazi &amp; Khlaif, 2022; Kim et al., 2021). The literature analyzed reports on the factors that influence  the  knowledge  of  novice  teachers  (Wei,  2021) and focuses on teacher training in AI (Lindner &amp; Berges, 2020; Olari &amp; Romeike, 2021). Thus, AI training proposals can be found aimed at both teachers in training (Xia &amp; Zheng, 2020) and practicing educators. Training schemes focus  on  their  knowledge  in  technologies  to  facilitate their professional development (Wei et al., 2020) through the  TPACK  (Technological,  Pedagogical  and  Content Knowledge) teaching knowledge model (Gutiérrez-Fallas &amp; Henriques, 2020). Studies focusing on teachers' opinions on curriculum development in AI are relevant (Chiu &amp; Chai, 2020), as are their self-efficacy in relation to ICT (Wu et  al.,  2020),  their  opinions  on  the  tools  that  support the teaching-learning process in AI (Holstein et al., 2019) and their teacher training in technologies (Cheung et  al,  2018;  Jaskie  et  al.,  2021).  These  elements  are  central to the design of an AI literacy strategy in K-12. Both the  co-design  of  ML  curricula  between  AI  researchers and K-12 teachers, and the assessment of the impact of these  educational  interventions  on  K-12  are  important issues  today.  At  present,  there  is  a  shortage  of  teachers with training in  AI  and  working  with  teachers  in  training (Xia &amp; Zheng, 2020) or with teachers in schools (Chiu et al., 2021) is proposed as an effective solution. One of the  most  interesting  analyses  of  teacher  competency


<!-- PAGE 11 -->


proposes  the  acquisition  of  this  skill  for  the  teaching of  AI  in  K-12,  through the analysis of the curricula and resources  of  AI  using  TPACK.  This  model  was  formulated by (Mishra &amp; Koehler, 2006) and aims to define the different types of knowledge that teachers need to integrate  ICT effectively  in  the  classroom.  In  this  regard,  it is suggested that teachers imparting AI to K-12 students require  TPACK  to  build  an  environment  and  facilitate project-based classes that solve problems using AI technologies (Kim et al., 2021).

## AI literacy support resources

Research  using  this  approach  focuses  on  presenting resources that support AI literacy (Kandlhofer &amp; Steinbauer,  2021),  considering  that  the  creation  of  resources and repositories is a priority in supporting this teachinglearning process (Matarić et al., 2007; Mongan &amp; Regli, 2008). However, these resources largely do not meet an interdisciplinary approach and do not embody a general approach to AI development (Sabuncuoglu, 2020).

## Gender diversity in AI literacy

AI  education,  as  a  broad  branch  of  computer  science, also needs to address the issue of gender diversity. Lack of gender diversity can impact the lives of the people for whom  AI-based  systems  are  developed.  The  literature highlights  the  existence  of  proposals  designed  with  a perspective toward gender, where the activities designed are specifically aimed at girls (Ellis et al., 2009; Jagannathan &amp; Komives, 2019; Perlin et al., 2005; Summers et al., 1995; Vachovsky et al., 2016; Xia et al., 2022).

## Discussion

The huge impact that AI is having on our lives, at work and in every type of organization and business sector is easily recognizable today. No one doubts that AI is one of the most disruptive technologies in history, if not the most. In recent years, the expectations generated by AI, far from being deflated, have only grown. We are still a long way from general-purpose AI, but the application of AI to solve real problems has already taken hold for a  wide range of purposes. It is therefore necessary for young people to know how AI works, as this learning will  make  it  easier  for  them  to  use  these  technologies in  their  daily  lives,  both  to  learn  and  to  interact  with others.

Like  any  other  technology,  the  potential  uses  and abuses of AI go hand in hand with its disruptive capacity. Many social groups and governments are expressing concern about the possible negative consequences of AI misuse. Although it is crucial to adequately regulate the use of AI, education is as important, if not more important, than regulation. Everything, whether good or bad, stems from  the  education  received.  Thus,  education  systems must  prepare  students  for  a  society  in  which  they  will have to live and interact with AI. AI education will enable young people to discover how these tools work and, consequently, to act responsibly and critically. Therefore, AI literacy has become a relevant and strategic issue (Chiu &amp; Chai, 2020).

This  systematic  review  has  focused  on  analyzing  AI teaching-learning proposals in K-12 globally. The results confirm  that  the  teaching  of  basic  AI-  related  concepts and  techniques  at  the  K-12  level  is  scarce  (Kandlhofer et al., 2016). Our work shows that there have been, on the one hand, different AI learning experiences and, on the other  hand,  proposals  for  the  implementation  of  AI  literacy, made at the political level and by different experts. The learning experiences described show that AI literacy in  schools  has  focused  on  technical,  conceptual,  and applied skills in some domains of interest. Proposals for AI  implementation,  especially  those  defined  by  the  US and China, reveal that significant efforts are being made to design models that frame AI literacy proposals.

We  also  found  that  there  are  hardly  any  AI  learning experiences  that  have  analyzed  learning  outcomes,  e.g., through  assessments  of  learners'  understanding  of  AI concepts. Obviously, this is a result of the infancy of these AI learning experiences at the K-12 level. However, it is important for learning experiences to be based on clearly defined  competencies  in  a  particular  AI  literacy  framework, such as those proposed in the literature (Alexandre et al., 2021; Han et al., 2019; Long &amp; Magerko, 2020; Malach &amp; Vicherková, 2020; Micheuz, 2020; OttenbreitLeftwich et al., 2021; Touretzky et al., 2019a; Wong et al., 2020;  Xiao  &amp;  Song,  2021;  Zhang  et  al.,  2020).  Recently, Van  Brummelen  et  al.  (2021a)  designed  a  curriculum for a five-day online workshop based on the specific AI competencies  proposed  by  Long  and  Magerko  (2020). They  used  several  types  of  questionnaires  to  assess  the quality of the program through the knowledge acquired by the students in these competencies. Therefore, clearly defined competency-based learning experiences can provide a rigorous assessment of student learning outcomes.

The  research  shows  that  clear  guidelines  are  needed on what students are expected to learn about AI in K-12 (Chiu, 2021; Chiu &amp; Chai, 2020; Lee et al., 2020). These studies highlight the need for a competency framework to guide the design of didactic proposals for AI literacy in K-12 in educational institutions.  This  framework  would provide a benchmark for describing the areas of competency that K-12 learners should develop and which specific educational projects can be designed. Furthermore, it  would  support  the  definition  of  a  curriculum  reflecting sequence and academic continuity (Woo et al., 2020). Such a curriculum should be modular and personalized


<!-- PAGE 12 -->


(Gong et al., 2019) and adjusted to the conditions of the schools  (Wang  et  al.,  2020).  In  the  teaching  of  AI,  an exploratory  education  should  be  adopted,  which  integrates  science,  computer  science  and  integral  practice (Wang et al., 2020). It should also address issues related to the ethical dimension, which is fundamental to the literacy of K-12 students as it enables them to understand the basic principles of AI (Henry et al., 2021). This training facilitates the development of students' critical capacity, and this is necessary to understand that technology is not neutral and to benefit from and make appropriate use of it. Ethics, complementary to legal norms, enhances the democratic quality of society by setting legitimate limits in the shaping of technological life. In this sense, different AI literacy proposals in K-12 already support the addressing of ethical, social and security issues linked to AI technologies (Eguchi et al., 2021; Micheuz, 2020; Wong et al., 2020).  Moreover,  considering  designing  for  social  good could foster or help to motivate learning about AI (Chai et al., 2021). Without a doubt, all this will impact on the achievement  of  a  more  democratic  society.  Due  to  the gender gap in issues related to computer science, it is also necessary to address the gender perspective. In this vein, the  research  proposes,  among  other  strategies,  to  focus AI  literacy  on  real-world  elements  since  this  approach favors the motivation of girls and greater involvement in learning (Jagannathan &amp; Komives, 2019). However, little attention  is  paid  to  the  undesirable  consequences  of  an indiscriminate and insufficiently thought-out application of  AI,  both  in  higher  education  and  especially  in  K-12. For  example,  the  increase  in  socio-economic  inequality between countries  and  within  countries,  resulting  from the  increasing  automation  of  employment,  is  of  particular  concern. This is leading to growing inequality in wages and preservation of human employment, but it is not usually a subject of interest in education.

Currently,  the  challenges  of  this  AI  literacy  require an interdisciplinary and critical approach (Henry et al., 2021). We believe that AI literacy can be leveraged to enhance  the  learning  of  disciplinary  core  subjects  by integrating  AI  into  the  teaching  process  of  those  subjects. AI literacy should rely on transferring AI knowledge and methods to core subjects, allowing education to cross disciplinary boundaries, but staying within the framework  of  disciplinary  core  subjects.  To  achieve this change, educators need to take a closer look at the current  capabilities  of  AI.  This  would  enable  them  to identify all options to improve the core of educational practice  and  thus  optimize  the  educational  process. For  example,  understanding  and  using  word  clouds  is a  powerful  educational  strategy  to  enhance  education in core subjects such as science (e.g., to facilitate object classification), language (e.g. to enable the matching of different topics or authors' works), music (e.g., to support the analysis of song lyrics) or social sciences (e.g., to assist in comparing different discourses). Since AI is highly  interdisciplinary  in  nature,  it  has  a  broad  projection  on  multiple  fields  and  problems  that  require a  transversal  and  applied  approach.  For  example,  the basic algorithms of ML could be taught in Mathematics  and  related  disciplines,  the  design  of  supervised classifiers could be performed for the study of taxonomies  in  Biology,  natural  language  processing  could  be used to make the study of a language more attractive, or the ethical issues surrounding AI could be discussed in Philosophy and Social Sciences subjects.

Finally,  for  this  meaningful  learning  to  take  place,  AI teaching must be addressed through holistic, active, and collaborative  pedagogical  strategies  in  which  real  problem solving is the starting point of the learning process. An important gap regarding the integration of AI in K-12 concerns  teachers,  as  it  is  unclear  how  to  prepare  and involve them in the process (Chiu &amp; Chai, 2020). Teachers'  attitudes  towards AI have a significant influence on the effectiveness of using AI in education. Teachers can swing between total resistance and overconfidence. The first  could  arise  from  inadequate,  inappropriate,  irrelevant, or outdated professional development. On the one hand,  teachers  must  be  digitally-competent  enough  to integrate AI into the teaching-learning processes of their subjects.  Therefore,  teacher  training  is  also  necessary following  a  framework  of  standard  competencies.  This should include new ways of organizing the professional role of teachers, as well as enhancing students' attitudes towards  these  changes.  On  the  other  hand,  research reveals  that  it  is  essential  for  didactic  proposals  to  be co-designed  and  implemented  by  the  teachers  at  those schools  involved  (Henry  et  al.,  2021),  to  undergo  training in the specific AI subjects and for this knowledge to be integrated into non-computer subjects (Lin &amp; Brummelen, 2021). To this end, it is crucial to identify the perception and knowledge that teachers have about AI and involve them in the design of curricular proposals (Chiu, 2021; Chiu &amp; Chai, 2020; Chiu et al., 2021).

## Conclusion

This study aimed to understand how AI literacy is being integrated into K-12 education. To achieve this, we conducted  a  search  process  following  the  systematic  literature  review  method  and  using  Scopus.  Two  broad groups of AI literacy approaches were identified, namely learning  experiences  and  theoretical  perspective.  The study revealed that learning experiences in schools have focused mainly on technical and applied skills limited to a  specific  domain  without  rigorously  assessing  student

learning  outcomes.  In  contrast,  the  US  and  China  are leading  the  way  in  AI  literacy  implementation  schemes which are broader in scope and involve a more ambitious approach. However, there is still a need to test these initiatives through comprehensive learning experiences that incorporate an analysis of learning outcomes. This work has  allowed  us  to  draw  several  conclusions  that  can  be considered in the design of AI literacy proposals in K-12. Firstly,  AI  literacy  should  be  based  on  an  interdisciplinary  and  competency-based  approach  and  integrated into the school curriculum. There is no need to include a  new AI subject in the curriculum, but rather to build on the competencies and content of disciplinary subjects and then integrate AI literacy into those subjects. Given the interdisciplinary nature of AI, AI education can break disciplinary boundaries and adopt a global, practical, and active  approach  in  which  project-based  and  contextualized work plays an important role. Secondly, AI literacy should  be  leveraged  to  extend  and  enhance  learning  in curricular subjects. As a final point, AI literacy must prioritize the competency of teachers and their active participation in the co-design of didactic proposals, together with pedagogues and AI experts.
