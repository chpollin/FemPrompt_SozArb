## Abstract

BACKGROUND Generative artificial intelligence (Gen-AI) chatbots hold promise for building highly personalized, effective mental health treatments at scale, while also addressing user engagement and retention issues common among digital therapeutics. We present a randomized controlled trial (RCT) testing an expert-fine-tuned Gen-AI-powered chatbot, Therabot, for mental health treatment.

METHODS We conducted a national, randomized controlled trial of adults (N=210) with clinically  significant  symptoms  of  major  depressive  disorder  (MDD),  generalized  anxiety disorder (GAD), or at clinically high risk for feeding and eating disorders (CHR-FED). Participants were randomly assigned to a 4-week Therabot intervention (N=106) or waitlist control (WLC; N=104). WLC participants received no app access during the study period but gained access after its conclusion (8 weeks). Participants were stratified into one of three groups based on mental health screening results: those with clinically significant symptoms of MDD, GAD, or CHR-FED. Primary outcomes were symptom changes from baseline to postintervention (4 weeks) and to follow-up (8 weeks). Secondary outcomes included user engagement, acceptability, and therapeutic alliance (i.e., the collaborative patient and therapist relationship). Cumulative-link mixed models examined differential changes. Cohen's d effect sizes were unbounded and calculated based on the log-odds ratio, representing differential change between groups.

RESULTS Therabot  users  showed  significantly  greater  reductions  in  symptoms  of  MDD (mean changes: -6.13 [standard deviation {SD}=6.12] vs. -2.63 [6.03] at 4 weeks; -7.93 [5.97] vs. -4.22 [5.94] at 8 weeks; d=0.845-0.903), GAD (mean changes: -2.32 [3.55] vs. -0.13 [4.00] at 4 weeks; -3.18 [3.59] vs. -1.11 [4.00] at 8 weeks; d=0.794-0.840), and CHR-FED (mean changes: -9.83 [14.37] vs. -1.66 [14.29] at 4 weeks; -10.23 [14.70] vs. -3.70 [14.65] at 8 weeks; d=0.627-0.819) relative to controls at postintervention and follow-up. Therabot was well utilized (average use &gt;6 hours), and participants rated the therapeutic alliance as comparable to that of human therapists.

CONCLUSIONS This is the first RCT demonstrating the effectiveness of a fully Gen-AI therapy chatbot for treating clinical-level mental health symptoms. The results were promising for MDD, GAD, and CHR-FED symptoms. Therabot was well utilized and received high user ratings. Fine-tuned Gen-AI chatbots offer a feasible approach to delivering personalized mental

health interventions at scale, although further research with larger clinical samples is needed to confirm their effectiveness and generalizability. (Funded by Dartmouth College; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT06013137.)

## Introduction

T he  prevalence  and  burden  of  mental  health  disorders have increased significantly over the past three  decades. 1   Despite  the  adverse  impact  of these  disorders, 2   mental  health  infrastructure  is  inadequately resourced to meet the current and growing demand for  care. 3-5   Although  empirically  validated  psychosocial treatments exist, 6-8  they are resource intensive, and limited in scalability and accessibility, leading to fewer than half of the people with a mental health disorder receiving care. 5,9 Digital  therapeutics  (DTx)  -  automated,  evidence-based software for the treatment or diagnosis of medical conditions 10 - offer a solution to bridge this gap.

While DTx aim to improve the accessibility  and  scalability of evidence-based mental health interventions, 11  these approaches have been plagued by attrition and low rates of engagement. 12  Within established psychotherapies, there is evidence for the benefit of nonspecific factors, such as therapeutic alliance (i.e., the collaborative relationship between patient and therapist), empathy, and shared goals. 13  The relative lack of personalization and alliance in DTx, compared with human-delivered psychosocial interventions, is likely to contribute to reduced engagement. 14  These nonspecific factors have been difficult to emulate via automated technologies and may be fundamentally different, or unachievable, in automated software. 15

Artificial intelligence (AI) represents a promising direction for improving DTx. Chatbots hold particular promise given their capacity to imitate human conversation and dialogue, long known to be integral parts of psychotherapeutic treatments - that is, the talking cure. 16  In fact, mental health and  wellness  chatbots  are  not  a  new  phenomenon,  with ELIZA, 17   an  early  rule-based  chatbot,  used  to  emulate  a Rogerian therapist. The study of chatbots for mental health remains  nascent,  with  evaluation  limited  to  exclusively rule-based  conversational  agents  to  date.  Although  such chatbots (e.g., Woebot) have shown benefits in clinical trials, 18   and in some cases a capacity to promote a therapeutic  alliance, 19   they are inherently limited by their reliance on an explicitly programmed decision trees and restricted inputs.

Recent  advances  in  computing  and  machine  learning now  allow  for  sophisticated  systems  capable  of  learning, adapting, and understanding context in natural language, removing the necessity for explicit programming. Pushing these  bounds  even  further  in  the  language  domain,  the advent of generative AI (Gen-AI), recently popularized by ChatGPT, 20  has enabled the automated production of novel and highly personalized responses to human input. To date, conversational agents using Gen-AI have fallen under general purpose, wellness, or companion applications, 21  rather than software intended for the diagnosis and treatment of mental health disorders. Although some Gen-AI-powered chatbots have shown both broad appeal and the capacity to form human-like bonds, 22  they are not intended and have not been evaluated for mental health treatment. The nondeterministic and open-ended nature of Gen-AI, enabling the  possibility  of  harmful  responses,  has  paused  adoption  in  mental  health.  Such  risks  associated  with  Gen-AI and related chatbots underscore the need for a systematic approach to exploring the safety of chatbots for use in mental health.

Despite  significant  risks,  there  is  potential  benefit  from the  use  of  therapeutic  Gen-AI-powered  chatbots.  Paired with  existing  frameworks  for  DTx,  Gen-AI  chatbots  have unprecedented potential to address existing problems with engagement while powering the development of new and personalized  interventions.  Although  the  literature  supports  the  effectiveness  of  cognitive  behavioral  therapy (CBT)-based DTx and rule-based AI chatbots for depression and anxiety, and Gen-AI chatbots exhibit promise for addressing issues of accessibility, scalability, engagement, and  personalization  in  mental  health  care,  to  our  knowledge,  no  prior  RCTs  have  investigated  the  effectiveness and safety of a Gen-AI chatbot for the treatment of mental health symptoms. Beginning in 2019, we started developing Therabot, a Gen-AI chatbot trained using expertly written therapist-patient dialogues based on third-wave CBT, 23 integrating empirically grounded contextual and functional approaches  to  mental  health  problems.  Developed  with over 100,000 human hours comprising software development, training dialogue creation, and refinement, Therabot is designed to augment and enhance conventional mental health treatment services by delivering personalized, evidenced-based mental health interventions at scale.

In this RCT, we examined Therabot's effectiveness for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) symptoms, generalized  anxiety  disorder  (GAD)  symptoms,  and  clinically  high-risk  feeding  and  eating  disorder  (CHR-FED) symptoms in  a  large,  nationally  representative  sample  of

participants.  We  hypothesized  that  participants  assigned to  a  4-week  intervention  with  Therabot  would  measurably improve in mental health symptoms across all clinical domains relative to patients assigned to the waitlist control (WLC)  condition  at  both  postintervention  (4  weeks)  and follow-up (8 weeks). Furthermore, we hypothesized participants would demonstrate a high level of engagement with Therabot, rate Therabot positively, and develop a therapeutic alliance with Therabot.

## Methods

## TRIAL DESIGN

The  study  was  designed  as  a  randomly  assigned,  WLC trial  with  a  1:1:1  allocation  ratio  across  the  MDD,  GAD, and  CHR-FED  symptom  groups.  A  Meta  Ads  campaign was used to recruit adults across the United States. Given its  broad  and  diverse  reach,  samples  gathered  via  Meta Ads have been shown to represent varied age, education, and  gender  groups. 24   Based  on  self-reported  responses to  a  baseline  questionnaire,  with  instruments  detailed in  the  Supplementary  Appendix,  participants  screening positive  for  MDD,  GAD,  or  CHR-FED  symptoms  were stratified  accordingly  into  one  of  the  three  groups  and then randomly assigned to either the control or intervention  group.  We  assumed  participant  identity  to  be  truthful  unless  we  detected  irregularities  in  identity  data.  We automatically  blocked  identical  email  addresses,  phone numbers,  and  IP  addresses  to  prevent  duplicates  during sign-up. Furthermore, we used a custom-designed two-factor authentication system built into REDCap to ensure that participants indeed owned the phone number that they provided. We included a manual review in cases of uncertainty. Comorbidity  was  allowed,  and  outcomes  were  analyzed based on participants scoring within the respective groups at baseline, regardless of their primary presenting problem.

Participants  randomly assigned to the intervention group were prompted daily to interact with Therabot during the treatment  phase  (first  4  weeks).  During  the  subsequent postintervention follow-up phase (weeks 4-8), participants were not prompted but were permitted access to Therabot. Both groups, intervention, and WLC, received assessments at  baseline,  postintervention  (4  weeks),  and  follow-up  (8 weeks).  Therabot  access  was  disabled  in  the  treatment group after 8 weeks; owing to a 72-hour grace period and variations  across  time  zones,  the  actual  access  duration was potentially up to 60 days. After completing their final assessment, the WLC group was also provided full access to Therabot. Study data were collected and managed using REDCap electronic data capture tools hosted at Dartmouth College. 25,26

## MODEL TRAINING AND INFERENCE

We utilized transformer-based, decoder-only architectures. The system employed both Falcon-7B and LLaMA-2-70B models in tandem. The models were trained and deployed on AWS SageMaker. During training, we applied quantized low-rank  adaptation  (QLoRA)  for  efficient  fine-tuning  to optimize the models' generation of appropriate responses based on conversation history. For inference, the conversation history was used to prompt the fine-tuned models via SageMaker end points.

## PARTICIPANTS

The participants  were  required  to  be  at  least  18  years  of age  and  to  screen  positive  for  clinical-level  symptoms  of at  least  one  of  the  following:  MDD,  GAD,  or  CHR-FED. Participants  who  screened  positive  for  CHR-FED  were given priority assignment until recruitment goals were met for that group. Otherwise, participants were assigned to the pathology group coinciding with their most severe screening measure. Exclusion criteria included active suicidality, mania, and psychosis (see the Supplementary Appendix).

## INTERVENTION

Therabot  is  a  text-based  multithread  chat  application  for iOS and Android that can interact with participants regarding their mental health problems in natural language. The intervention  utilizes  a  generative  large  language  model (LLM)  fine-tuned  on  expert-curated  mental  health  dialogues.  The  dialogues  were  developed  by  our  research team, including a board-certified psychiatrist and a clinical psychologist, and peer-reviewed using evidence-based (primarily  CBT)  modalities.  Given  the  potential  risks  associated with Gen-AI, we added multiple guard rails, including a crisis classification model.

For the first 4 weeks, participants in the intervention group were  prompted  daily  to  engage  with  Therabot.  During the  subsequent follow-up phase (weeks 4-8), participants engaged with Therabot as frequently as they desired. The application allowed users to either initiate a session directly in the chat interface or to respond to scheduled notifications. In response to a user prompt, conversation history, and the most recent user message were combined and sent to the LLM.  Common  output  included  empathetic  responses, validation, targeted interventions, or questions prompting

elaboration (see Fig. 1). All responses from Therabot were supervised by trained clinicians and researchers post-transmission.  In  the  event  of  an  inappropriate  response  from Therabot  (e.g.,  providing  medical  advice),  we  contacted the participant to provide correction. In the event of a participant raising safety concerns (e.g., suicidal ideation), we contacted  the  participant  to  provide  safety  guidance  and emergency resources.

## MEASURES

Primary  outcome  measures  were  administered  to  both groups at baseline, postintervention (4 weeks), and follow-up (8  weeks)  and  included  the  Patient  Health Questionnaire 9 27 (PHQ-9), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder  Questionnaire  for  the Diagnostic  and  Statistical Manual  of  Mental  Disorders ,  Fourth  Edition  (DSM-IV) 28 (GAD-Q-IV), and the Weight Concerns Scale (WCS) within the Stanford-Washington University Eating Disorder 29 (SWED),  as  measures  of  depression,  anxiety,  and  weight concerns,  respectively.  The  SWED  was  used  in  full  as  a baseline  risk  stratification  tool  to  ensure  we  represented participants with CHR-FED.

The PHQ-9 sum score ranges from 0 to 27, with a decrease of  5  or  more  shown  to  constitute  a  clinically  meaningful change 30  and a score of 10 or more often used as a clinical threshold  for  MDD  screening.  The  GAD-Q-IV,  designed to assess GAD based on DSM-IV and DSM-5 criteria, can be scored via binary criterion method or a total sum score ranging from 0 to 13. The WCS score ranges from 0 to 100 and constitutes a mean of five Likert-style items, normalized from 0 to 100. 29  Although the PHQ-9 has established clinically  meaningful  change  thresholds,  the  GAD-Q-IV and WCS have not; therefore, we use Cohen's d values for primary effect sizes, given their widespread use in evaluating psychiatric trials.

Secondary outcomes included therapeutic alliance (Working Alliance Inventory - Short Revised 31  [WAI-SR]), engagement with Therabot (number of messages sent), and satisfaction  with  Therabot  (self-developed  survey).  Each domain of the WAI-SR (goal, task, and bond) is scored as the

mean of four Likert-style items, resulting in a score range of 1-5. Additional details on the primary and secondary outcomes are presented in the Supplementary Appendix.

## SAMPLE SIZE JUSTIFICATION

Based on the comorbidity between diagnoses, we expected to  have 100 participants in each analysis. A Monte-Carlo simulation study was used to estimate the statistical power for  the  differential  change  in  treatment  response.  For each  simulated  dataset  (N=80-150),  we  generated  ordinal data such that the treatment group showed differential changes (d=0.3-0.5) over time. We assumed 10% missing data.  We  fit  cumulative-link  mixed  models  (CLMMs;  see Statistical  Methods  below),  with  individual  differences  as random  intercepts.  The  interaction  effects  between  time and randomly assigned group determined power, with the proportion of times the interaction terms were significant representing  power.  The  results  suggested  that  we  had greater than 90% power to detect a differential response of 0.3 and 0.5

## RANDOM ASSIGNMENT

Random assignment was performed using a computer-generated random sequence with a fixed block size of six. The random assignment sequence was generated prior  to  the trial start, and the assignment process was fully automated. Once group assignment occurred, neither researchers nor participants were blinded to their group membership.

## STATISTICAL METHODS

To  examine  the  effectiveness  of  Therabot  relative  to  the waitlist control group, we examined the effect of time and treatment assignment on depression, anxiety, and weight concerns  among  participants  at  a  clinical  level  of  MDD, GAD,  and  CHR-FED  at  baseline.  The  participants  were analyzed within the groups to which they were randomly assigned.  Owing  to  the  trivial  percentage  of  missing  outcome  data,  we  used  complete  case  analysis.  To  ensure complete case analysis provided an unbiased estimate, we also analyzed the data using multiple imputation for missing data handling. The results were nearly identical, with no changes to the interpretation, and are displayed in the Supplementary Appendix.

To  address  the ordinal, nonequidistant  nature  in the response categories of our symptom measures and eliminate potential distortion of effect size estimates and inflated error rates, we used CLMMs to analyze the effects of time and  random  assignment  as  fixed  effects,  and  random individual differences in the outcome. The logit link function was used, which was well suited for proportional odds models,  and  thresholds  were  assumed  to  be  symmetric around  the  latent  mean  of  zero.  Formally,  the  model  is described as follows:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where  Y  represents  the  ordinal  outcome  (MDD,  GAD,  or WCS  score), j denotes  the  threshold  category, α j are  the threshold parameters, and β 1 , β 2 , and β 3 are the fixed-effect coefficients  for  time,  group,  and  their  interaction,  respectively. The coefficients of primary interest are the β 3 terms representing the differential  change  between  groups  from baseline at each follow-up time point. Here, u ID signifies the random  intercepts  for  the  participants.  Odds  ratios  were calculated from these estimates, and effect sizes were calculated  using  d=log(OR)×sqrt(3)/ π . 32 All  Cohen's  d  effect sizes were calculated between groups representing differential  change. The effect sizes are unbounded. All treatment effects reported in our analyses are marginal effects derived from CLMMs. These models provide predicted probabilities for each possible outcome score under each condition (treatment/control)  at  each  time  point.  To  obtain  interpretable statistics, we drew 10,000 samples from these model-predicted probability distributions, which provided stable estimates of means and standard deviations rather than using raw  scores. 33,34   For  example,  with  depression  symptoms (PHQ-9), the model predicts the probability of each possible score (0-27) for both groups at baseline, postintervention  and  follow-up.  The  change  scores  were  calculated  by comparing these sampled distributions across time points. This approach allows us to honor the ordinal nature of our measures while also providing clinically meaningful statistics,  with  effect  sizes  computed  directly  from  the  model's log-odds ratios and supporting statistics (means, standard deviations  [SDs])  derived  from  the  sampling  procedure. To control for multiple comparisons across our six primary end points (three outcomes measured at two time points), we  implemented  the  Holm-Bonferroni  sequential  procedure for familywise error rate control. Adjusted P values are reported for all primary analyses (see Table 1).

Descriptive results for working alliance and user satisfaction were visualized using box plots. In each plot, the box represents the interquartile range (IQR), with the median presented as a horizontal line. Whiskers extend to the smallest and largest values within 1.5×IQR from the hinges. Data beyond the whiskers are plotted as individual outliers.

## COMPENSATION

Participants were compensated $25 (U.S. dollars) for each of the three assessments completed.

## Results

## PARTICIPANTS

Participants included 210 adults, randomly assigned to intervention and WLC. By the 4-week assessment, four participants had withdrawn from the study (treatment group), and three were lost to follow-up (treatment group); six of these participants  had  opted  to  discontinue  the  Therabot  intervention. By the 8-week assessment, one participant was lost to  follow-up  (treatment  group).  Detailed  aggregate  demographics are displayed in Table 2. Figure 2 displays the flow of participants from screening to analysis, including counts of participants meeting clinical screening thresholds for each group. The study spanned March through May 2024, with recruitment from March 15-31, 2024. Recruitment ended when the enrollment target was reached.

## PRIMARY OUTCOMES

## Major Depressive Disorder Symptoms

Participants receiving the Therabot intervention showed large and greater improvement in depression symptoms compared with the control participants across both time points  (see  Table  1),  with  both  comparisons  remaining significant after adjusting for multiple comparisons. The mean change (SD) in PHQ-9 score from baseline to postintervention  was  -6.13  (6.12)  in  the  intervention group and -2.63 (6.03) in the control group. The change from baseline to follow-up was -7.93 (5.97) in the intervention  group  and  -4.22  (5.94)  in  the  control  group (Fig. 3, Row 1).

## Generalized Anxiety Disorder Symptoms

Similar  patterns  of  improvement  were  observed  for  anxiety  symptoms  (Table  1),  where  participants  receiving the Therabot intervention showed a large and differential response in anxiety symptoms across both postintervention and follow-up. The mean change (SD) in GAD-Q-IV score from baseline to postintervention was -2.32 (3.55) in the

intervention group and -0.13 (4.00) in the control group. The change from baseline to follow-up was -3.18 (3.59) in the intervention group and -1.11 (4.00) in the control group (Fig. 3, Row 2).

## Weight Concerns

The intervention group showed significantly greater improvements in weight concerns than the control group, exhibiting  a  large  differential  response  across  both  time points, with comparisons remaining significant after adjusting for multiple comparisons. The mean change (SD) in WCS score from baseline to postintervention was -9.83 (14.37)  in  the  intervention  group  and  -1.66  (14.29)  in the control group. The change from baseline to follow-up was -10.23 (14.70) in the intervention group and -3.70 (14.65) in the control group. (Fig. 3, Row 3).

## SECONDARY OUTCOMES

## User Working Alliance

The user working alliance, measured via the WAI-SR and offered to all participants in the treatment group who interacted  at  least  once  with  Therabot  at  4  weeks,  was  completed by 96 participants. The overall mean WAI score (SD) was 3.59 (1.27); the mean (SD) score for Bond was 3.71 (1.28); the mean score for Task was 3.47 (1.30); and the

mean score for Goal was 3.59 (1.35). Box plots for working alliance scores are displayed in Figure 4. Participants, on average, reported a therapeutic alliance comparable to norms reported in an outpatient psychotherapy sample. 31

## User Satisfaction

The user satisfaction survey was offered to all those in the treatment group who used Therabot, with 96 participants completing the survey. Participants rated their experience

on a seven-point Likert scale, with seven being the highest.  Users  rated  Therabot  as  easy  to  learn  to  use  (6.42, SD=1.18)  and  intuitive  (5.58,  SD=1.58).  On  average, users liked the interface (5.46, SD=1.93) and design (5.53, SD=1.98).  Users  reported  feeling  better  after  interaction (5.39,  SD=1.84)  and  found  the  Therabot  sessions  helpful  (5.44,  SD=1.82).  Users  reported  that  they  would  use Therabot on their own (5.12, SD=2.02) and rated Therabot as similar to a real therapist (4.90, SD=2.21). On average, overall satisfaction was 5.30 (SD=1.89). Box plots for user satisfaction ratings are shown in Figure 5.

## User Engagement

Of participants randomly assigned to the Therabot group, 101  (95%)  interacted  with  Therabot.  The  mean  number  of  messages  sent  by  participants  was  260  (min.=1, max.=1557),  with  the  mean  number  of  days  interacting with  Therabot  being  24  days  (min.=1,  max.=60).  The mean  total  amount  of  time  participants  interacted  with Therabot  was  6.18  hours  across  the  course  of  the  study. Participant engagement over the 4-week treatment phase is  depicted  in  Figure  6.  Participant  engagement  over  the full  study  period,  including  follow-up,  is  depicted  in  the Supplementary Appendix. Post-transmission staff intervention was required 15 times for participant safety concerns (e.g., expressions of suicidal ideation) and 13 times to correct  inappropriate  responses  provided  by  Therabot  (e.g., providing medical advice).

## Discussion

As  the  first  RCT  of  its  kind,  our  study  supports  the  feasibility,  acceptability,  and  effectiveness  of  a  fine-tuned, fully  GenAI-powered chatbot for treating  mental  health

symptoms.  Users  demonstrated  sustained  engagement and  rated  their  alliance  with  Therabot  as  comparable to  human  therapists  during  the  4-week  trial.  Critically, as  compared  with  the  WLC,  Therabot  users  showed  a greater  reduction  in  depression,  anxiety,  and  CHR-FED symptoms at postintervention (4 weeks) and at follow-up (8  weeks).  We posit that Therabot's success is driven by three main factors. First, akin to effective rule-based conversational agents, 18  Therabot is rooted in evidence-based psychotherapies  for  anxiety, 35   depression, 36   and  weight concerns. 37   Second,  users  had  unrestricted  access  to Therabot,  allowing  for  any  time-anywhere  interactions. Notably,  the  ability  to  access  therapeutic  support  when most needed, regardless of the time or location, may be one  of  the  most  significant  advantages  of  DTx.  Third, unlike  existing  chatbots  for  mental  health  treatment, Therabot  was  powered  by  Gen-AI,  allowing  for  natural, highly personalized, open-ended dialogue. Moreover, we argue that the Gen-AI approach promoted the therapeutic  alliance,  a  critical  nonspecific  mediator  of  change  in psychotherapy. 38  Although some evidence supports developing a therapeutic alliance with rule-based agents, 19  we see such a bond as inherently limited compared with that possible  with  Gen-AI-powered  agents;  Gen-AI  provides greater  capacity  for  personalized  adaptation  and  more closely resembles human-human interaction. Our results suggest  that,  within  4  weeks,  participants  were  able  to develop a working alliance comparable to that shown in an outpatient psychotherapy sample, 32  with use at consistently high rates.

Although  existing  companion  Gen-AI  chatbots  can  be highly engaging, they are not trained or evaluated for treating  clinical-level  mental  health  symptoms.  Such  chatbots may also be compromised by competing interests, such as user engagement or profit, which may be at odds with best practices for treatment. 39  Therefore, Gen-AI conversational agents tailored to integrate both evidence-based techniques and important nonspecific factors contributing to psychotherapy  outcomes  represent  a  significant  opportunity  to provide scalable, on-demand, and effective mental health treatment.  The  nascency  of  Gen-AI  and  associated  risks have likely contributed to the absence of a clinically validated Gen-AI chatbot for mental health treatment. Indeed,

IQR denotes interquartile range the nondeterministic nature of Gen-AI models introduces the possibility of hallucinations and incorrect or potentially harmful content. 22   While  human-delivered therapy is not immune  to  patient  iatrogenesis, 40   such  effects  in  Gen-AI models have the potential to impact more people and are less regulated.

We emphasize the need to understand Gen-AI's potential role and risks associated with mental health treatment and also the need for guardrails and close human supervision while testing such methods. All content was closely supervised for quality and safety in our trial, with rapid expert intervention available.  This  approach  may  continue  to  be necessary  when  testing  similar  future  models  to  ensure safety. In addition, given the inscrutable black-box nature of  Gen-AI  models,  the  inner  processes  are  difficult  or impossible to understand analytically. In this way, Gen-AI models are similar to human minds - intractable in complexity and predominantly studied by the data they produce - and thus may require extensive observation to obtain a reliable assessment.

Our results have important implications, forming the early foundational  evidence  for  the  use  of  fine-tuned  Gen-AIpowered  chatbots  in  mental  health  treatment.  Therabot shows promise as a means to scale evidence-based therapies in a way that maintains a high degree of personalization and engagement. Furthermore, our approach enables novel  translations  of  therapeutic  techniques  that  are  not possible in rule-based agents. Consider, for instance, detailed and personalized imaginal exposures prompted by Gen-AI agents. Interventions dependent on the therapeutic alliance or specific patient-therapist interactions may also benefit from the integration of Gen-AI chatbots.

Our  study  has  notable  strengths,  including  a  nationally recruited, demographically diverse, moderate sample size. Furthermore, unlike many digital mental health studies, 41 Therabot ran on both Android and iOS devices, increasing generalizability.  However,  we  also  acknowledge  several limitations.  First,  given  our  recruitment  strategy,  there was  potential  for  selection  bias  toward  younger,  more technologically minded participants who were open to AI.

The color represents the number of messages sent per day.

However, this may also resemble the most likely end users. Relatedly, up-front disclosure of a monetary incentive may have introduced selection bias, favoring participants who were  motivated  financially.  Second,  the  characteristic  of WLC RCTs is that there was potential for differential contact between the intervention and control group. We helped mitigate  this  by  planning  equivalent  contact  between groups whenever possible. Last, our follow-up period was limited to 4 weeks postintervention (weeks 4-8). While this allowed  for  testing  early  effectiveness  and  safety,  longer studies  are  needed  to  assess  the  durability  of  Therabot's effectiveness.

Overall,  results  from  the  Therabot  RCT  are  highly  promising. We found high engagement and acceptability of the intervention,  as  well  as  symptom  decreases  while  maintaining a therapeutic alliance comparable to that of human therapists and their patients. Future work may extend the range  of  psychopathologies  treated  (e.g.,  obsessive-compulsive disorders), the settings in which Gen-AI chatbots are provided (e.g., emergency rooms), and the role of the GenAI  chatbot  (e.g.,  adjunctive  to  in-person  psychotherapy). Furthermore, future work should build on our descriptive user engagement metrics to define clinical thresholds pertaining to minimal doses of Gen-AI-driven therapies. Our study  provides  key  groundwork  for  the  development  of Gen-AI chatbots for mental health treatment.
