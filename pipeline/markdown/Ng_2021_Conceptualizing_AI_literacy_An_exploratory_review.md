## 1. Introduction

Artificial intelligence (AI) was first defined as ' the science and engineering of making intelligent machines ' in 1956 (McCarthy, 2007, p. 2).  Throughout  several  decades  of  the  20th  century,  AI  has  evolved progressively into intelligent machines and algorithms that can reason and adapt based on sets of rules and environment which mimic human intelligence (McCarthy, 2007). Wang (2019) broadened the definition of AI which  can  perform  cognitive  tasks particularly learning  and problem-solving  with  the  exciting  technological  innovations  such  as machine  learning,  natural  language  processing  and  neural  networks (Zawacki-Richter, Marín, Bond, &amp; Gouverneur, 2019).

Artificial intelligence will eventually affect many facets of human life rather than merely computer industries and everyone should learn AI. Currently,  the  use  of  AI  has  spread  across  industries  (e.g.,  business, science, art, education) to enhance user experience and improve efficiency. Applications of AI exist in many parts of our everyday life (e.g., smart home appliances, smartphones, Google, Siri). Vast majority of the public acknowledges the existence of AI services and devices, but seldom do they know about the concepts and technology behind, or aware of potential ethical issues related to AI (Burgsteiner, Kandlhofer, &amp; Steinbauer,  2016;  Ghallab,  2019).  Although  AI  will  generate  significant benefits for users, businesses and economies, and lift productivity and economic growth, AI is poised to eliminate millions of current jobs and

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has spread across industries (e.g., business, science, art, education) to enhance user experience, improve work efficiency, and create many future job opportunities. However, public understanding of AI technologies and how to define AI literacy is under-explored. This vision poses upcoming challenges for our next generation to learn about AI. On this note, an exploratory review was conducted to conceptualize the newly emerging concept ' AI literacy ' , in search for a sound theoretical foundation to define, teach and evaluate AI literacy. Grounded in literature on 30 existing peer-reviewed articles, this review proposed four aspects (i.e., know and understand, use and apply, evaluate and create, and ethical issues) for fostering AI literacy based on the adaptation of classic literacies. This study sheds light on the consolidated definition, teaching, and ethical concerns on AI literacy, establishing the groundwork for future research such as competency development and assessment criteria on AI literacy.

cause  declines  in  some  occupations  (Davenport &amp; Ronanki,  2018; Manyika et al., 2017).

Second, studies reflect that the rise of AI will create many job opportunities in various industries, and AI will probably replace tomorrow ' s  workplace. Even though not all disciplines are not going to be replaced by AI, people with AI knowledge will replace those that do not in  the  future  of  work.  In  a  MicKinsey  report,  Manyika  et  al.  (2017) estimated that 15% of the global working hours will be automated and 47%  of  American  jobs  are  at  high  risk  of  automation  by  2030. Furthermore, the situation could be worse among women since over 160 million women worldwide may need to transition between occupations often into higher-skilled roles. Among different natures of work, clerical work such as secretaries and bookkeepers will be mostly easily eliminated by AI, given that 72% of those jobs in advanced economies are held by women (Manyika et al., 2017). As such, to gain a competitive advantage at work, similar to classic literacy which includes reading/writing and mathematical abilities, AI literacy has emerged as a new skill  set  that  everyone  should  learn  in  response  to  this  new  era  of intelligence.

Literacy was popularly understood as an ability to read and write (McBride, 2015). In today ' s digital era, the emergence of the knowledgebased society implies that every citizen must be 'digitally literate ' and possess basic competencies in order to be on a better footing in terms of equal opportunities in their workplaces (Bawden, 2008, p. 102).

term has been extended to new literacies such as media, digital, information, computer and AI literacy (Kong et al., 2021). In the twenty-first century, students who are equipped with these skills could use related technologies  and  computers  in  very  advanced  ways  to  learn  new knowledge and skills with their counterparts (Bell, 2010; Griffin &amp; Care, 2014; Larson &amp; Miller, 2011). Nowadays, AI technology emerges and becomes essential skills to play critical roles across disciplines and industries (Ng et al., 2021; Touretzky et al., 2019). Students need to learn how to use AI technologies judiciously, as well as to discriminate between ethical and unethical practices (Robinson, 2020; Rodríguez-García,  Moreno-Le ´ on,  Rom ´ an-Gonz ´ alez, &amp; Robles,  2020).  AI potentially  becomes  one  of  the  important  technology  skills  in  the twenty-first century. As such, to combine AI and literacy, AI literacy means having the essential abilities that people need to live, learn and work  in  our  digital  world  through  AI-driven  technologies,  and  this should be taught at the K-12 levels (Steinbauer et al., 2021).

AI learning started in university computer science education which required  advanced  programming  competencies  that  were  not  at  an appropriate level for K-12 learners. Educators faced challenges in scaffolding K-12 children to understand AI concepts through syntax-based programming  (e.g.,  McCarthy,  2007;  Wong  et  al.,  2020).  The  emergence of more age-appropriate hardwares and softwares enabled educators to improve the learning process for younger learners in recent years. The access to a wide range of technologies in day-to-day life, such as chatbots and translation apps, presents opportunities for everyone to understand  and  use  AI  in  everyday  life.  This  enables  educators  to leverage on the availability of AI technologies to inculcate AI literacy for young learners. For example, prior studies discussed the potential to incorporate AI learning in K-12 STEAM education via playful experience such as gamified and social media tools to prepare children for future science, technology, engineering, art and mathematics workforces (e.g., Ng, 2021; Ng &amp; Chu, 2021; Zou, Wang, &amp; Zhao, 2019).

Knowing  and  using  AI  for  future  careers  is  only  one  aspect  of teaching AI literacy for educators. Any technology as potent as AI would also bring new risks due to algorithmic bias and malicious uses of AI (Brundage et al., 2018). People often overlook the importance of the roles  of  AI  ethics,  which  is  considered  as  extraneous  or  surplus  to technical concerns in work settings (Hagendorff, 2020). Software developers usually feel a lack of accountability and moral significance of their work, especially when economic incentives are easily overriding commitment to ethical  principles  and  values  (Hagendorff,  2020).  As such,  educating  both  citizens  and  computer  scientists  AI  ethics  is essential to strengthen their social responsibility, and consider social inclusion and diversity to apply AI for societal good (Dignum, 2019). In this review, we examine the published studies to evaluate the ethical concerns in the domain of AI literacy.

According to Google Scholar search, there is a dramatic increase in AI literacy publications from 2014 to 2021 (see Fig. 1). As AI becomes more and more important in work settings and everyday life, researchers

began to define AI literacy based on the term 'literacy ' which has been applied to define skill sets in varied disciplines (Long &amp; Magerko, 2020). However, few studies have  provided  comprehensive  explanations  on how to conceptualize AI literacy. To achieve a better understanding of the concept of AI literacy, we categorize how researchers define the term in four aspects, inspired from the cognitive domains in Bloom ' s taxonomy. Then, we evaluate how educators help learners develop AI literacy skills with emerging technological tools, and evaluate their assessment accordingly. To fill this gap, this study reviewed the relevant literature, and analysed how scholars define ' AI literacy ' , how it can be learned, and what are the ethical concerns. Specifically, the present study poses the following four research questions:

1.  How do researchers define the term ' AI literacy ' ?
2.  How  do  educators  help  learners  develop  AI  literacy  in  terms  of learning artefacts, pedagogical approaches and subject matters?
3.  How do researchers evaluate students ' AI literacy skills?
4.  What are the ethical concerns in the domain of AI literacy?

## 2. Method

## 2.1. The search and manuscript selection process

As AI literacy is an emerging field in the twenty-first century, hence available literature is limited. In search for literature on AI literacy, both peer-reviewed  scholarly  articles  and  conference  papers  from  K-12  to higher education levels published from 2016 to 2021 through the Web of Science, Scopus, ProQuest Education Collection, IEEE and ACM digital library were included in this review. The first publication year found in the databases was 2016. The aforementioned databases were considered among the world ' s most trusted citation indices platforms for evidencebased quality scientific research and hence helped us to ensure the inclusion of quality scientific content (Mongeon &amp; Paul-Hus, 2016). The articles  that  contained  the  phrase ' AI  literacy ' OR ' Artificial  intelligence literacy ' in either the title, the abstract, main text or keywords were downloaded and reviewed by the researchers. The search resulted in 46 articles.

After excluding irrelevant studies, as of Apr 11, 2021, a total of 30 articles were identified. The articles were downloaded and reviewed by our researchers during the document review. The selected articles then were  examined  by  two  researchers  to  determine  whether  they  were suitable for the purpose of this study. During this examination, a set of inclusion and exclusion criteria were adopted to ensure generalisation of the findings and avoid biases in the studies selection (see Table 1). For example, Sharma (2019) focused on the impact made by AI in entrepreneurial activities including encouraging social innovation, improving the institutional environment and gaining support from international  organizations,  instead  of  integrating  AI  in  educational settings.

## 2.2. The data coding and analysis processes

This study began with formulating the study objectives, followed by a review and analysis of AI literacy research trends according to the four research questions. Then, the full text of the chosen articles was qualitatively classified using the constant comparative method espoused by Glaser (1965), which was used in other recent systematic reviews (e.g., Hew &amp; Cheung, 2014; Terras &amp; Warwick, 2013). Through studying the main content in the selected articles, similar meaningful concepts were identified  and  extracted  for  further  thematic  analysis.  Corresponding text segments were coded under the coding schemes in each research question. To establish coding reliability, six (30%) of the articles were randomly picked, blind-coded and analysed by the two researchers. Two experienced researchers then read and categorized the papers based on the coding scheme. Disagreements were resolved through discussing the disputed  studies.  Cohen ' s  kappa  coefficient  (0.9)  was  found  to  be excellent  to  show  inter-rater  reliability  between  coders  (Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994). After validating the coding scheme, the data findings were then descriptively analysed and summarised in terms of frequency, percentages and identified themes. In the case of discrepancy, the coders resolved this and reached a final decision through discussion.

## 3. Results and discussion

In  this  section,  background  information  (i.e.,  publication  year, country, levels of education and research method) of the 30 selected studies is first described (see Table 2). Then, we present the results and discuss  these  results  according  to  the  four  research  questions.  The publications of AI literacy papers increase from 2016 (2 articles) to 2019 (8 articles). Nineteen published articles were found between 2020 and April  2021.  Although  the  number  of  publications  found  in  the

abovementioned  databases  were  limited,  it  is  observed  that  the increasing  trend  of  publications  is  consistent  with  Google  Scholar ' s trend.  In  addition,  we  listed  the  nationality  information  of  the  first author in the AI literacy paper and observed that many countries have begun conceptualizing AI literacy. The regions that published two or more AI literacy articles include: the United States (9), China (4), Hong Kong (4), Spain (3) and Austria (3).

Researchers  conducted  studies  and  implemented  AI  literacy  interventions  across  various  educational  levels.  Most  of  the  articles focused on primary school (14) and secondary school (14) students that covered almost half of the reviewed studies. Only a few studies were implemented for citizens (4), university students (4) and teachers (2). Finally, some articles studied AI literacy in less conventional settings in AI to bring up students for their future work, including libraries (1), medicine (1) and meteorology (1). About one-third of the studies (9) were  conducted  in  an  informal  setting,  which  included  after-school programs,  out-of-school  activities  and  poster  presentations.  Seven studies  were  conducted  in  regular  lessons  in  a  formal  setting.  The remaining  papers  did  not  specify  whether  the  settings  are  formal  or informal. One possible reason is that AI literacy is an emerging field, and most researchers tend to conduct preliminary studies to explore their interventions  in  an  informal  setting  or  merely  write  opinion  papers based on their observation.

Overall,  there  are  1  review  paper,  4  conceptual  articles  and  25 empirical studies. Regarding the research method, most of the empirical studies adopted qualitative (12) methods (see Table 3). Researchers used quantitative  methods  (5)  to  assess  students ' AI  concepts,  perceived abilities and other constructs such as confidence in using AI and social skills.  Seven studies adopted a mixed-method approach (8) to collect data  via  multiple  data  sources  including  ability  tests,  questionnaire surveys, field notes, interviews and observations. We found one review article (i.e.,  Long &amp; Magerko, 2020) in which they searched broader terms such as ' AI education ' , ' learning about AI ' and ' AI school ' to map the key concepts underpinning AI literacy on their AI4K12 mailing list  and  selected  papers.  Since AI  literacy  articles  emerged  these  few years, this review discusses how researchers use the specific term ' AI literacy ' instead of teaching and learning AI.

## 3.1. RQ 1. how do researchers define the term ' AI literacy ' ?

Of the 30 articles, 17 articles defined AI literacy based on the ideas of 'literacy ' .  Prior  to  AI  literacy,  the  term ' digital  literacy ' emerged to assess basic computer-related concepts and skills when computer applications  gained  popularity  across  industries  in  the  1970s.  It  was necessary for  users  to  become  competent  in  using  computer  systems related to their specific task or job. The importance of digital literacy increased as more people depend on the use of computer technologies to develop new social and economic opportunities (Leahy &amp; Dolan, 2010).

In  succession  to  digital  advancement,  AI  started  to  arise  and  imitate human  intelligence  in  machines  for  computers  to  learn,  reason  and perceive. It was initially used in scientific research and academic environments but had yet become ubiquitous in our daily lives. In summary, four aspects of fostering AI literacy were identified from the review (see Table 4).

## 3.2. Know and understand AI

Twenty-seven articles conceptualize AI literacy as educating learners about acquiring fundamental concepts, skills, knowledge and attitudes that require no prior knowledge. On top of being the end users of AI applications,  learners  should  understand  the  technologies  behind. Burgsteiner et al. (2016) and Kandlhofer et al. (2016) defined AI literacy as the ability to understand the basic techniques and concepts behind AI in different products and services. Moreover, some researchers associate AI literacy with perceived abilities, confidence and readiness in learning AI. In K-12 education, Druga et al. (2019) and Lin et al. (2021) designed learning curriculums and activities that foster AI literacy that focuses on how learners gain AI concepts.

## 3.3. Use and apply AI

All 30 articles emphasized the importance of educating learners to know how to apply AI concepts in different contexts and applications in everyday life. For example, Rodríguez-García et al. (2020) evaluated LearningML, a machine learning model builder, to educate citizens to understand AI applications and how it can affect our lives, as well as knowing the ethical issues regarding AI technologies. In addition, half of the  studies  (19)  discussed  the  human-centered  and  ethical  considerations and focused on using AI concepts and application ethically, which would be further discussed in RQ4. Eight articles borrowed the ideas of computational  thinking  to  interplay  AI  literacy  and  AI  thinking  (see Table 5). AI thinking refers to the construction of logic and algorithms in order to support students ' understanding of how to use knowledge bases for  problem-solving,  processing  semantics  and  handling  unstructured data  (Vazhayil  et  al.,  2019).  For  example,  How  and  Hung  (2019) leveraged AI thinking through conducting data analytics with computing,  and  interpreted  new  findings  from  the  machine-learned discovery of hidden patterns in data.

## 3.4. Evaluate and create AI

AI  augments  human  intelligence  with  digital  automation  and  19 articles alluded AI literacy to engage learners in higher-order thinking activities. Other than knowing and using AI with concepts and practices, some studies had extended AI literacy to two other competencies that enabled individuals to critically evaluate AI technologies, communicate and collaborate effectively with AI (e.g., Long &amp; Magerko, 2020). For example, Han et al. (2018) enhanced students ' scientific and

(2019); Julie et al. (2020); Vazhayil et al. (2019).              |

technological knowledge which then was applied in scientific research-based learning to solve practical problems. Long et al. (2019) engaged citizens in co-creating AI amenities in public spaces to broaden their public AI literacy and experiences. Participants could engage with public  interactive  artworks  progress  sequentially  from  being  initially attracted to an AI-enabled installation to relate their interaction with the installation and other people.

Overall,  although  these  articles  showed  slight  variations  on  the definition of AI literacy, they support the notion that everyone, especially K-12 children, acquire basic AI knowledge and abilities, enhance motivation for future career, as well as use AI-enabled technology (Chai, Lin, et al., 2020). In addition to knowing and using AI ethically, AI literacy serves as a set of competencies that enables individuals to critically evaluate AI technologies, communicate and collaborate effectively with AI (Long &amp; Magerko, 2020).

## 3.5. Bloom ' s taxonomy

Specifically, a definition for AI literacy learning is presented in the aforementioned three aspects. In fact, the abilities and skills involved in each aspect could be potentially mapped to the cognitive domains in Bloom ' s Taxonomy. Bloom ' s Taxonomy is an approach to categorize the levels of reasoning skills and ordered thinking required across different learning contexts. There are six levels in the taxonomy, each requiring a higher level of complexity and ordered thinking from the students. The levels  are  understood  to  be  successive,  so  that  one  level  must  be mastered  before  the  next  level  can  be  reached  (Bloom,  1956;  Huitt, 2011). The reason why we adopted the Bloom architecture is that AI literacy is novice to educators and a classification of levels of cognitive processes  has  not  yet  been  developed  in  the  context  of  AI  learning. However, this model is a classic pedagogical theory that establishes the core  foundation  of  AI  taught  to  young  learners.  In  our  review,  it  is proposed to assign these three aspects (i.e., know and understand, use, and evaluate and create AI) into the cognitive levels of Bloom ' s Taxonomy. ' Know and understand AI ' is assigned to the bottom two levels; ' use and apply AI ' in applying concepts and applications is assigned to the apply level; ' evaluate and create AI ' are assigned to the top three levels to analyse, evaluate and create AI (see Fig. 2).

In our review, most studies discussed how to foster learners ' AI literacy in knowing and understanding AI (27), as well as how to use AI applications  in  everyday  life  and  apply  its  underlying  concepts  in different  contexts  (30).  Only  19  articles  (63.3%)  mentioned  how  to enhance  students  to  analyse,  evaluate  and  create  AI  applications through higher-order thinking activities. A possible reason that existing AI literacy studies focused more on general skills and knowledge about AI is that AI literacy is a set of fundamental skills and abilities in helping everyone,  including  children  and  citizens,  to  acquire,  construct  and apply knowledge. They may not necessarily handle how to abstract and decompose AI problems, nor build AI applications; instead, they need to know the basic  concepts  and  use  AI  ethically.  As  such,  most  of  our

selected AI literacy studies put more emphasis on engaging learners in lower-level thinking activities. However, when students are promoted to secondary  schools  and  universities,  they  become  knowledgeable  to apply their prior knowledge to create their own artefacts and justify decisions with AI applications and algorithms.

## 3.6. RQ 2. how do educators help learners develop AI literacy in terms of learning artefacts, pedagogical approaches and subject matters?

This  review aims to fill recognized gaps in knowing the effective means to integrate AI literacy into school curricula and how educators help learners develop AI literacy. The elements found in our studies into the  Technological,  Pedagogical  and  Content  Knowledge  (TPACK) framework are categorized in terms of learning artefacts, pedagogical approaches, and subject matters (see Fig. 3). The reason that we adopt the TPACK model is that it is widely used across studies to identify how teachers can incorporate technologies into their pedagogical methods and content knowledge, and conceptualizes their capacity and knowledge  that  is  needed  to  integrate  relevant  technologies  in  AI  literacy education (e.g., Graham, 2011; Koehler et al., 2013). It provides a map for  understanding how to integrate AI literacy into classrooms effectively. For example, Kim et al. (2021, pp. 1 -13) based on AI learning resources to conceptualize TPACK to improve teaching for K-12 AI education, which offers core foundations of AI taught to young learners. Among  the  three  knowledge,  technological  knowledge  involves  the affordances and use of domain-specific learning tools such as hardware and software in AI literacy education, AI-enabled tools (e.g., intelligent agents),  and  unplugged  learning  tools  (e.g.,  role-playing).  Second, pedagogical knowledge relates to teaching methods and their application  to  promote  student  AI  literacy  learning,  which  entails  teaching strategies  and  scaffolding,  feedbacking  students ' learning  processes (Janssen et al., 2019). Third, content knowledge concerns knowledge about  the  AI  literacy  subject  matter  that  specific  subjects  should  be covered in the curriculum.

Learning  artefacts: Given  the  complexity  of  AI,  age-appropriate learning artefacts were important to scaffold students ' AI conceptual understandings and stimulate their motivation and interest in learning AI. In recent years, there has been an increase in hardware and software that enhance AI concepts accessible to younger learners. Table 6 provides an overview of the types of AI learning artefacts ranging from hardware (8) to software-focused artefacts (6), intelligent agents (11) and unplugged learning tools (5). The democratization of current AI technologies encourages students to make intelligent agents and machine learning models without needing to program such as ML-for-kids and Teachable Machine (Kaspersen et al., 2021; Long &amp; Magerko, 2020). In this context, we can see an opportunity for educators to democratize access  to  AI  literacy  and  reinforce  the  AI  concepts  through  these emerging tools.  In  addition,  AI-driven  tools  such  as  chatbot,  writing assistants and web mapping encourage students to experience the societal impact and technological affordances of AI applications. Alternatively,  five  studies  designed  unplugged  learning  activities  to  foster students ' AI literacy without using a computer through engaging approaches such as case study, role-playing and storytelling (e.g., Julie et  al.,  2020;  Rodríguez-García  et  al.,  2020).  On  the  whole,  most  researchers restricted the development of AI literacy skills within Computer Science-related learning artefacts, while some researchers extended AI literacy skills to non-CS elements such as role-playing and storytelling.

## 3.7. Pedagogical approach

The pedagogies including teaching methods and strategies are classified according to the levels of education. One of the aims of AI literacy education for primary schools is to familiarize children with the basic concepts of AI/computer science and encourage them to discover the connection between AI applications and the underlying concepts. For

example, researchers introduced children to AI concepts in playful and inquiry approaches via high-order thinking activities such as creating digital stories (Kandlhofer et al., 2016), performing Turing Test with intelligent  agents,  creating  chatbot  and  inference  algorithms  (Wong et  al.,  2020),  and  building  applications  through  blockly-based  programming  (Gong  et  al.,  2020).  In  addition  to  understanding  the connection between those AI techniques and common AI applications, secondary school students should have the abilities to apply prior AI knowledge in practical group projects to analyse and solve problems independently (Kandlhofer et al., 2016). Thus, educators could design real-world,  collaborative  projects  based  on  the  principles  of  constructionism and instructionism (Kandlhofer et al., 2016). Researchers suggest  various  hands-on  activities  such  as  robot  constructions  (Williams  et  al.,  2019),  data  and  comparative  visualization  (Wan  et  al., 2020), as well as training AI models (Vazhayli et al., 2019) as possible means to promote AI literacy in secondary school levels.

Adult learners are categorized as university students and the general public. Since university students have obtained fundamental AI understanding, they are more ready for further developments in this field. They could conduct projects or research to describe problems formally and on a higher abstraction level (Kandlhofer et al., 2016). As such, they could apply AI skills and knowledge to solve real-world problems for future academic and career challenges (Chat et al., 2020).

To cultivate the general public to understand and use AI applications ethically, free online resources and courses (Robinson; 2020), public art installations and museum exhibits (Rodríguez-García et al., 2020) are viable approaches to establish a collaborative, creative, robust and safe society.

## 3.8. Content knowledge

In  K-12  education,  studies  that  involved  the  design  of  learning curricula and activities focus on how learners gain AI concepts, and how they apply AI to contexts of their interests (e.g., Druga et al., 2019; Lin et  al.,  2021).  Long  and  Magerko  (2020)  and  Rodríguez-García  et  al. (2020) mentioned Touretzky et al. (2019) ' s five ' big ideas ' of AI have set a sound framework for future research on fostering AI literacy:

- /uni25CF Perceptions: Computers perceive the world using sensors.
- /uni25CF Representation and reasoning: Agents maintain representation of the world and use them for reasoning.
- /uni25CF Learning: Computers can learn from data.
- /uni25CF Natural interaction: Intelligent agents require many  kinds  of knowledge to interact naturally with humans.
- /uni25CF Societal impact: AI can impact society in both positive and negative ways.

Inspired by this framework, Wong et al. (2020) further categorized AI literacy in K-12 into three dimensions: AI concepts, applications and ethics.  In  another  study,  Rodríguez-García  et  al.  (2020)  evaluated LearningML,  a  machine  learning  model  builder,  to  develop  critical thinking. This model builder teaches K-12 students on AI fundamentals to understand the applications of AI, how it can affect their lives, and the ethical issues that arise from AI technologies.

In higher education, AI knowledge and skills become more advanced to meet the future job demands. Kandlhofer et al. (2016) and Burgsteiner et al. (2016) listed a set of AI concepts that have potential to become the basis  for  careers  in  science  and  engineering:  automata,  intelligent agents, graphs and data structures, basics of computer science, machine learning, etc., based on the ' Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach ' written by Russell Stuart and Norvig (2009). Four studies mentioned the importance of educating citizens on fundamental AI concepts, and the impacts of AI technologies on their everyday lives. For example, Robinson  (2020)  mentioned  that  the  Norwegian  policy  document,  in  a section titled ' AI for everyone: Elements of AI ' (p. 44) asserts the government  will  make  AI  learning  courses  globally  accessible  in  2020, which conceptualizes AI literacy as educating their citizens about the elements of AI that require no prior knowledge (Robinson, 2020). In addition, three studies focused on AI learning in specific disciplines (i.e., meteorology, medicine and library) to describe how AI can be applied in vocational training and workplace application (e.g., using healthcare-AI technologies for delivering prevention, diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation services) (Karaca et al., 2021; Rivero, 2020; Zou et al., 2019).

## 3.9. Teacher education

From  the  review,  four  articles  discussed  how  learning  programs could strengthen teacher preparation especially for those without prior knowledge  so  that  they  could  incorporate  AI  literacy  into  school curricula  (Vazhayil  et  al.,  2019;  Xu,  2020).  Vazhayil  et  al.  (2019) explored how 34 Indian teachers perceived AI literacy learning after the workshop (e.g., ' How did you find the teaching methods used during the training? ' , ' Do  you  think  this  workshop  will  enjoy  you  the  most? ' ) (p.74). Teachers need to first update their knowledge of AI concepts that potentially be introduced in their schools. Then, they design suitable teaching methods and strategies (e.g., collaborative problem-solving) and choose age-appropriate learning materials  to  stimulate  students ' interest. They also need to consider various teaching challenges such as insufficient  funding,  immature  AI  curricula,  tools  and  evaluation methods (Gong et al., 2020), as well as technical concerns that whether their  schools ' internet infrastructure is ready for students to compile AI-enabled algorithms and applications (Vazhayil et al., 2019).

Apart  from  updating  teachers ' AI  knowledge  to  solve  teaching challenges,  educators  need  to  know  and  use  suitable  AI-enhanced technologies such as adaptive learning systems to facilitate their daily teaching practice and management, and promote personalized learning to  understand  students ' learning  progress  and  needs  (Xu,  2020).  Xu (2020)  proposed  the  importance  of  learning  AI  for  educators  that ' teachers who know how to use AI may replace the teachers who do not know how, because AI can empower teachers and promote their role transformation  which  greatly  improve  the  efficiency  of  management and the level of decision-making ' (p.290). In addition, teachers should enable students to use AI-enhanced learning tools such as intelligent tutors and adaptive learning systems to facilitate personalized learning (e.g.,  self-diagnosing,  providing  automatic  feedback  and  promoting online collaboration among learners) (Cavalcanti et al., 2021).

## 3.10. RQ 3. how do researchers evaluate students ' AI literacy skills?

Among 30 studies, researchers adopted quantitative (13) and qualitative  (18)  evaluation  methods  to  examine  how  to  assess  students ' mastery and application of AI literacy-related skills (see Table 7), provided that we double-coded ' mixed-method research ' into quantitative and qualitative evaluation methods. In addition, Robinson (2020) is not

coded  in  RQ3  since  this  study  aimed  to  compare  how  trust,  transparency, and openness are defined and explored in AI government policy documents in different countries.

Quantitative methods: To evaluate K-12 students ' AI literacy, one important component is to promote their intention to learn and possess basic knowledge about AI. Thirteen studies used quantitative methods to assess the knowledge acquisition of K-12 and university students via preand post-knowledge tests (e.g., What are the characteristics of depthfirst  search?), and students ' perceived abilities (e.g., How would you rate your knowledge about search algorithms?) (Kandlhofer et al., 2016; Wan et al.,  2020).  Furthermore,  studies  discussed  other  quantitative aspects via surveys to understand students ' perceptions (non-cognitive aspects) towards AI literacy education such as confidence in using AI, motivation and AI for societal good.

Qualitative methods: Nineteen researchers collected qualitative data by taking pictures, field notes during teaching, and interviewing students to understand their motivations, expectations and lessons learned. For  example,  Druga  (2019)  recorded  students ' interaction  with  AI agents  through  field  observations  and  adopted  a  three-attribute  AI perception questionnaire to evaluate how 102 children (7 -12 years old) interacted and perceived their AI agents in their lessons. These three attributes measure whether the agents are smarter, truthful and understand them (e.g., ' What do you think of Google Voice, an AI-enabled agent? ' ).  Children  replied  that  the  most  fun  features  were  playing beat-box and music, taking pictures and playing games. Watkins (2020) collected exhibition feedback from 367 participants to present the most frequently asked questions in a poster session (e.g., ' Will librarians be able to develop programming with this tool? ' ) (p.17).

## 3.11. Tools for assessing AI literacy

To examine AI literacy assessment, researchers and AI educators now use quantitative and qualitative tools to examine students ' AI literacy development. To better understand the interplay between cognitive and non-cognitive  constructs  of  fostering  AI  literacy,  studies  began  to explore  the  changes  in  attitudes,  behaviours  and  cognitions  toward statistics in different AI educational contexts. Table 7 demonstrates the assessment constructs and tools to evaluate students ' AI cognitive and non-cognitive development. To further understand how to examine AI literacy through quantitative and qualitative tools, we categorized three major assessment types that have been found in the literature, including knowledge  tests,  survey,  portfolio  assessment  and  artefact-based  interviews.  Some  studies  adopted  more  than  one  assessment  type  to triangulate the learning outcomes of students ' AI literacy.

Knowledge  test: Six  studies  developed  selected  or  constructedresponse  questions  such  as  multiple  choice  and  structured  questions which are evaluated by correctness and completeness for summative purposes. Kandlhofer et al. (2016) used paper-and-pencil exercises to assess students ' existing knowledge of AI concepts such as graphs, trees and data structures as evidence of student AI proficiency. Students ' AI knowledge acquisition and retention of AI skills was assessed in Lin et al. (2021), Wan  et al. (2020) and Rodríguez-García,  Moreno-Le ´ on, Rom ´ an-Gonz ´ alez, &amp; Robles, 2021 studies via some pre-post knowledge tests. Lin et al. (2021) administered AI concepts tests to address common core AI concepts including decision tree, logics system, neural network and machine learning. Wan et al. (2020) conducted pre-post questionnaires with written answers to questions relating to clustering, similarity comparison and k-means clustering process whereas Rodríguez-García, Moreno-Le ´ on, Rom ´ an-Gonz ´ alez, &amp; Robles, 2021 selected and modified 14-item questions from other available tests and online resources, such as Machine Learning for Kids website and MOOC platforms on AI. Williams et al. (2019) developed three or four multiple-choice questions on a tablet or paper to probe what kindergarten children understood about AI  knowledge  such  as  classification  and  generative  AI  to  triangulate students ' learning behavior observation in relevant activities.

The usage of this traditional knowledge test suggests that AI literacy can  be  considered  as  knowledge  and  skills  gained  which  could  be regarded  as  quantifiable  mastery  of  knowledge  regarding  AI  components. Since AI will be more widely taught in K-12 and non-computer science  university  programs,  it  is  observed  that  there  will  be  more reliable  and  valid  knowledge  assessment  which  can  be  conveniently adapted into learning interventions to understand students ' AI knowledge for a summative assessment purpose.

Survey: Surveys  are  widely  used  to  investigate  perceived  ability, affective and non-cognitive learning outcomes (e.g., motivations, attitudes  toward  AI  learning)  in  educational  research.  Eleven  studies developed surveys designed quantitative items to understand students ' perceptions  of  AI,  and  open-ended  questions  to  collect  student  selfreport  responses.  Although  surveys  were  often  used  to  examine  students ' non-cognitive  outcomes,  several  studies  used  surveys  to  elicit students ' perceived AI understandings. For example, Chai, Wang, and Xu (2020) and Chai, Lin, et al. (2020) designed a 6-item questionnaire to understand students ' confidence, perceived relevance of learning AI and readiness towards AI. The survey was then modified by Lin et al. (2021) who employed structural equation modeling to validate primary students ' motivation  for  learning  AI  for  the  future  development  of  AI curricula  and  instruction.  It  is  found  that  AI  literacy  is  significantly associated with the aspects including subjective norms, perceived usefulness of AI, AI for social good, attitude toward using AI, AI optimism and confidence in learning AI (Chai, Wang, &amp; Xu, 2020; Lin et al., 2021). Another study Register &amp; Ko (2020) applied qualitative thematic analysis  of  students ' open-ended  responses  about  how  machine  learning systems work, as well as other aspects including ML model transparency, critical thinking and learners ' interests and backgrounds. One advantage of using surveys is that it consists of convenient data collection from a large sample size which could produce quantifiable results. However, it limits students ' rich description from their learning exposure. To fill this gap, the usage of project portfolio analysis and artefact-based interviews could be incorporated into knowledge tests and surveys to triangulate students ' AI learning.

Project  portfolio  analysis  and  artefact-based  interview: Project portfolio analysis refers to a purposeful and systematic process of collecting and evaluating various types of students ' learning artefacts such as products, projects and programs (McMillan, 2013). With students ' project portfolios, researchers and educators can interview students to examine their AI concepts and practices. Five studies applied project portfolio analysis with a follow-up interview to examine the attainment of  learning  targets.  For  example,  Kaspersen  et  al.  (2021)  evaluated students ' AI models and user interface design through collecting and labelling data, and building, testing and evaluating models. After analysing the artefacts in students ' projects, researchers found that children were able to apply their new knowledge of machine learning (ML) to their own life and to think up personally meaningful applications using ML.  Another  study  Watkins  (2020)  asked  participants  to  create  2D visualization and related kiosk applications that were demonstrated in the makerspaces and libraries at universities, and further invited visitors to perceive their AI applications in Cosmology. Kandlhofer et al. (2021) studied  students ' picture  taking,  field  notes,  interaction  and  project demonstrations  during  each  teaching  unit.  Then,  they  performed semi-structured interviews and content analysis to examine how students foster their AI understandings. However, it is observed that researchers  did  not  generate  a  grading  rubric  to  indicate  the  levels  of achievement  for  each  dimension  of  AI  learning  performance  and whether a criteria is met. Future research could design rubrics to analyse students ' AI concepts that could be graded by human raters and/or AI education systems such as chatbots, expert systems and intelligent tutors (Zhang &amp; Aslan, 2021).

Through artefact-based interviews, it is useful to understand which AI  components  students  could  understand  and  use  more  frequently through  communication  and  students ' projects.  Since  AI  learning  is novice to K-12 educators, the application of portfolio assessment and follow-up interviews could capture a holistic view of what extent of

GLYPH&lt;0&gt;,GLYPH&lt;0&gt;


<!-- PAGE 9 -->


knowledge and skills students need to obtain, and how educators design and choose their learning materials and tools in their learning design. In addition, this also encourages educators to use in classrooms and across platforms to formatively assess students to offer them feedback that is potentially beneficial to their future AI learning.

With  the  great  potential  of  using  artefact-based  interviews,  researchers  usually  employed  interviews  to  support  and  elaborate  on students ' portfolio assessment by specifying their thinking processes of using AI skills to solve problems (e.g., how they got started, how the project  evolved,  what  was  important  for  them  to  know  to  make  the project, what problems they encountered throughout the process, and how  they  dealt  with  those  problems).  Furthermore,  students  could reflect on themselves when working on the hands-on projects, such as what they were most confident of, what they might want to further improve,  and  what  engaged them.  However, the  challenges  of  using interviews include its high cost and long time spent on interviewing and coding the data as well as its small distribution to students, which makes it difficult to be quantified (Tang et al., 2020). Throughout artefact-based interviews, researchers were able to have detailed discussions  about  different  AI  elements  in  students ' projects,  and  to develop rich descriptions of their development practices.

## 3.12. RQ 4. what are the ethical concerns in the domain of AI literacy?

As AI plays an important role in day-to-day decision making, misused or poorly designed AI could cause irreparable harm to humans and the society  (Fourtan ´ e,  2020).  AI-concerned  scientists  and  engineers  like Elon  Musk  expound  on  the  horrors  that  future  AI  technologies  may wreak on humanity in decades to come (Johnson, 2019). In our review, Schaper et al. (2020) reflected that international organizations such as UNICEF and OECD argue for the need of transparency and explainability in AI to offer meaningful information to understand AI systems, user interactions  and  societal  impacts  (Vincent-Lancrin &amp; Van  der  Vlies, 2020; UNICEF, 2019). Nineteen studies had mentioned human-centered considerations, and raised attention to educate citizens to become socially responsible and ethical users (Ahmad, Teredesai, &amp; Eckert, 2020). Gong et al. (2020) found that students pay little attention to ethical concerns  such  as  bias  in  AI  and  legal  responsibility,  and  intellectual property. In this regard, researchers began to notice the importance of AI human-centered concerns such as inclusiveness, fairness, accountability, transparency,  and  ethics,  instead  of  merely  enhancing  students ' AI abilities and interests (Hagendorff, 2021; Microsoft, 2021). For example, Lin  et  al.  (2021)  designed  a  middle-school  curriculum  to  develop  AI literacy through combining AI concepts, ethics, awareness and careers. Their study envisioned that the foundation of future AI industries would be built on ' principles of inclusivity, provide equitable access, include consideration of multiple stakeholders and potential users, and minimize the potential for bias ' (p.191). To summarize, conceptualizing AI literacy  with  human-centered  considerations  is  crucial  to  building  a future inclusive society.

To bring up future responsible citizens who are competent in using AI in a reliable, trustworthy and fair manner, broadening participation in AI for everyone and ensuring inclusive AI learning designs are necessary. Teachers should address the learning needs of under-represented groups including, but not limited to, gender, ethnic minorities, social-economic status and cultural background when teaching AI. For example, Druga (2019) found that low social-economical children tend to have a harder time  advancing  AI  concepts  because  they  had  less  experience  with coding and interacting with these technologies in their everyday life. She  proposed  a  set  of  guidelines  to  make  AI  learning  inclusive  by avoiding deceiving technologies, offering ways for children to customize their  machines,  and  encouraging  collaboration  to  share  each  other ' s work (Druga, 2019).

## 4. Conclusion

In this review, a variety of definitions of AI literacy was identified. Most defined AI literacy based on different types of 'literacies ' , which had recently been applied to define skill sets in other disciplines. Most researchers advocated that instead of merely knowing how to use AI applications, learners should learn about the underlying AI concepts for their future careers and understand the ethical concerns in order to use AI responsibly.

Since AI literacy is an emerging field that there is a lack of journals published in this field, several limitations were identified. The keyword search  limited  the  scope  of  domain  specificity  within  the  AI  context while other subfields of AI like machine learning, neural network, etc. could potentially be related to this study but were not captured in the current  review.  Second,  some  articles  in  this  review  involved  interventions  and  learning  programs  that  were  relevant  to  AI  literacy. However,  the  articles  did  not  explicitly  define  the  term  AI  literacy. Third,  a  larger  pool  of  studies  discussing  AI  learning  and  teaching without mentioning the term ' AI  literacy ' were not included in this review; however, their interventions could be comparable to AI literacy instructional design. This suggests that future review could broaden the scope of search to common AI themes and to capture more literature in AI learning and teaching.

The existing gaps and needs in the AI literacy research were derived to bring forth potential areas for future studies. In this review, the majority of the articles (22) are conference papers while the other eight are journal  publications.  Moreover,  19  of  the  articles  used  qualitative research methods and were exploratory research for preliminary studies. In the near future, it is foreseen that research design will shift to be more empirical  and  interventional  (e.g.,  quasi-experiment,  design-based research) with clearly documented treatment and control groups, as well as  varied  data  analysis  procedures  (e.g., t -test,  one-way  analysis  of variance,  factor  analysis,  regression,  structural  equation  modeling). Furthermore, there is a need to examine the quality of different AI literacy assessments. Only three studies examine the reliability and validity  of  scales  for  AI  literacy  skills  by  conducting  exploratory  and confirmatory factor analysis (Chai et al., 2020a, 2020b; Dai et al., 2020). To advance the AI literacy field, priority needs to be placed on proposing definitive frameworks to guide educators to create lesson designs with appropriate pedagogies, learning artefacts and assessment criteria. We hope this review will inspire scholars, educators, and government officers to begin the discussion on how to define, implement and evaluate AI literacy in the future.

## 4.1. Recommendations for future AI literacy education

The  findings  of  this  review  present  a  preliminary  overview  of empirical research literature on AI literacy studies in the education field. This study contributes to addressing the aforementioned research gaps, and  provides  directions  for  future  research  on  AI  literacy  education based on the prevalent research questions:

- /uni25CF AI becomes a fundamental skill for everyone, not just for computer scientists.  In  addition  to  reading,  writing,  arithmetic  and  digital skills,  we  should  add  AI  to  every  learners ' twenty-first  century technological literacy in work settings and everyday life.
- /uni25CF Inspired  by  Bloom  taxonomy,  AI  literacy  possesses  basic  competencies to know and understand, use and apply, as well as evaluate and create AI. People need to equip themselves cognitively for future technological challenges in their workplaces. At the same time, it is important to foster their social responsibility and ethical awareness to use AI for societal good.
- /uni25CF Students  are  not  only  the  end  users  but  potentially  be  problemsolvers to use AI technologies in different scenarios, or even create possible  AI-driven  hardware  and  software  solutions  to  make  our society a better place to live in.

- /uni25CF AI  literacy  combines  the  ideas  of  data  science,  computational thinking and multi-disciplinary knowledge to interplay AI literacy and AI thinking.
- /uni25CF To facilitate educators ' teaching, the technological, pedagogical and content knowledge framework needs to be considered to provide a map for understanding how to integrate AI literacy into classrooms effectively. Age-appropriate learning artefacts and curricula need to be designed to scaffold K-12 students ' AI conceptual understandings and stimulate their motivation and interest in learning AI.
- /uni25CF Educators  should  update  their  AI  knowledge  to  solve  teaching challenges such as knowing and using suitable AI-enhanced technologies such as adaptive learning systems that facilitate their daily teaching  practice  and  management,  and  promote  personalized learning to understand students ' learning progress and needs.
- /uni25CF Future researcher and educators will develop pedagogical strategies (e.g., collaborative project-based learning, gamification) and theoretical models (e.g., self-determination theory, constructionism) to increase students ' motivation and engagement, promote interaction and collaboration, enhance motivation and attitudes, and develop numerous learning skills in the context of AI literacy.
- /uni25CF Future  researchers  and  educators  will  develop  quantitative  and qualitative assessments to examine students ' learning performance via post-knowledge tests, self-perceived surveys, learners ' artefacts, projects and conversations.
- /uni25CF Human-centered considerations are important to raise attention to educate  citizens  to  become  socially  responsible  and  ethical  users such  as  inclusiveness,  fairness,  accountability,  transparency,  and ethics,  instead  of  merely  enhancing  students ' AI  abilities  and interests.
