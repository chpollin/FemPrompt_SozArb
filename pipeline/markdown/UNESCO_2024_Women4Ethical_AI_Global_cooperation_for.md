## Statement W4EAI

## Women for Ethical AI Ac�on Request

A global debate on AI governance has occupied daily headlines in 2023. However discussed, it is o�en proposed as a trivial choice between limi�ng innova�on or  global  safety.    Unfortunately, there are several complexi�es and conflic�ng goals as interna�onal geopoli�cal stability, countries' power, public interests and with private profit .  For instance, governments have vested interested in suppor�ng the development of the most powerful AI technology to maintain or improve their interna�onal posi�on s. However, if this technology is uncontrollably developed and deployed to mere private profit then the risks to endanger public interests or even destabilize democracies become a toll too high to pay. Furthermore, innova�on can be furthered by responsible regula�on, since it provides certainty and creates trust. Protec�ng consumers, workers and every person's fundamental rights has become an unnego�able requirement from every government who has their ci�zen's best interest as its core value and mission.

The UNESCO 'Women for Ethical AI (W4EAI)' group aligns its voices to manifest deep support for this pivotal moment in the regulatory evolu�on for ar�ficial intelligence, signified by the landmark approval of the European Union AI Act by the Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) on December 8 th , 2023, which marks a crucial step in safeguarding democracy in the age of ar�ficial intelligence. This legisla�on signs the first step of a journey towards a new era of responsible and ethical AI prac�ces , which focuses on safety, legality, trustworthiness, and respect for fundamental rights.  W4EAI  also  recognizes  the  United  States'  leadership  in  shaping  AI  development  rules through  the  issuance  of  a  landmark  Execu�ve  Order 14110  on  Safe,  Secure,  and  Trustworthy Ar�ficial  Intelligence.  This  order  establishes  new standards  for  AI  safety  and  security  aiming  to safeguard  Americans'  privacy,  foster  equity,  civil  rights,  defend  consumers  and  workers,  and encourage innova�on and compe��on. Responsible AI development extend beyond EU and USA, the UK AI Safety Summit, the Hiroshima AI Process, the India's Presidency of GPAI, the San�ago Declara�on for an Ethical AI in LATAM and the Caribbean, Brazil's focus on AI and the inequalit y agenda at the G20 are all different ways to mark a new approach, considered by countries around the world, to structure and govern the current and future development of AI.

Today, more than ever, we are sure that AI, with its ubiqui tous impact in all areas of work and life, demands a cri�cal focus on governance to promote and protect human rights and human dignity, and ensure fair and inclusive outcomes, as agreed in the only universal instrument in this space, the UNESCO Recommenda�on on the Ethics of Ar�ficial Intelligence adopted in 2021 by UNESCO's

SHS/2024/PI/H/1

(at that �me) 193 Member States, and now covering 194 with the return of the US to UNESCO. This recommenda�on marks  the first  global  effort that  aims  to  serve  as  a  compass  of  ethical pr ac�ces to  govern all phases of an AI system development, from research to deployment and procurement,  while  prot ec� ng  human  rights,  human  dignity,  fundamental  freedoms,  and  the environment. Since  2021,  UNESCO  has  been  building  prac�cal  tools  like  the 'Ethical  Impact Assessment'  and  the  'Readiness  Assessment  Methodology  (RAM)'  that  aim  to  support  the advancement  of  Ethical  frameworks  for  i ns�tu�ons  and  industry  players. We  welcome  the deployment of UNESCO's RAM in 50 countries and look forward to the lessons learned that will be unveiled at the Global Forum on the Ethics of Ar�ficial Intelligence in Slovenia on February 5-6 th , 2024.

At a �me when AI's rapid advancements bring serious risks to humanity, the Women for Ethical AI pla�orm ( W4EAI) is suppor�ng the urgen t call for ethical governance of AI technologies, enhancing safety standards, comprehensive legal frameworks, including liability and security on any AI system, including founda�on models, which have been entering our markets without a clear understanding of all of its impact. We applaud na�ons who have been working to bring AI systems into a wellregulated space.

AI technical capabili�es are evolving at a pace we have never witnessed before, and companies are taking unnecessary risks. Some are releasing products that have been proved to amplify exis�ng bias,  propagate misinforma�on at scale, spread  polariza�on, compromise  privacy,  infringe copyrights and create new opportuni�es for gender and ethnicity discrimina�on . In addi�on, these systems  expose all  na�ons  to new  security  threats.  We  strongly  encourage  governments  to accelerate the establishment of na�onal policies for AI governance and to safeguard public safety, guarantee human rights, and uphold economic and poli�cal stability within their na�ons.

AI systems are by nature fluid and changeable as they con�nuously learn, therefore ex -ante (tes�ng before releasing a new system to the market) assessment is necessary but not sufficient. In the AI field, we call to establish ex-post assessment (regular tes�ng a�er a new system is released to the market) that periodically reassesses live systems for new possible harms or system degenera�on. To ensure that all risks are beter understood , we must ask governments to con�nuously update their guidelines, create new adaptable approaches to regula�on, enforce best prac�ce and new prac�ces while demand evidence of due diligence.

We call on governments to deploy all the instruments at hand and be innova�ve to shape the direc�on of the technological revolu�on. This is not only about regula�ons. They are important, as well as the ins�tu�ons in charge to make them count. But it is also about incen�ves, investments, and policies to direct the developments towards the public good. Only with the establishment of strong frameworks can the posi�ve impact of AI can be harnessed and the downsides controlled.

Confron�ng AI challenges is a journey that has only just started, and it requires mul� -stakeholder collabora�on s  and  diversity  in perspec�ves  to  con�nue  to  ensure that  AI  systems  contribute posi�vely to our lives while safeguarding the values that underpin our socie�es . This is the primary goal of the Women for Ethical AI Group.

This is an invita�on to stand with us !

We call on all countries to join the UNESCO's ac�vi�es to support the call for AI and the W4EAI mission to drive systema�c ac�ons for gender-inclusive AI . Specifically, we call for concrete ac�ons:

- -Aligning the development of AI technologies to the human rights framework in order to safeguard human dignity and gender equality.
- -Ensuring ex ante assessments of new developments before being launched in the market and ongoing ex post assessments.
- -Ensuring the rule of law, and liability mechanisms when harm is caused, including by sharing the code.
- -Ensuring human determina�on on these developments by not providing legal personality to AI developments.
- -Changing the way we manage data. Data should belong to the data subjects and not to the companies that can collect the informa�on. Ci�zens have the right to know how their data is used, and to call for full dele�on of their own informa�on from the cybe rspace.
- -Calling on governments to establish data trusts.

We also call for the integra�on of the gender perspec�ve in this work, in line with the Chapter of the  Recommenda�on  that  calls  for  investments,  but  also  for  affirma�ve  ac�on  and  dedicated budget, to ensure women's engagement and presence in these markets, not only as users, but as creators, founders, entrepreneurs and decision-makers.

We  welcome  the  global  effort  that  UNESCO  has  launched  with  the  support  of  the  European Commission, the Patrick McGovern Founda�on, the Development Bank of La�n America (CAF), and the Japanese Development Coopera�on, to support all members to implement the Recommenda�on, through the elabora�on of Readiness Assessment s in more than 50 countries, which, in turn, will provide specific recommenda�ons on how governments can develop their own capaci�es  to  deal  with  AI.  This  is  the  largest  effort  interna�on ally  to  shape  AI  developments ethically,  focusing  on  strengthening  the  capaci�es  of  governments,  developing  the necessary ins�tu�ons and frameworks, and training of civil servants.

We established the W4EAI to support this drive and are looking forward to the results of the Global Forum.
