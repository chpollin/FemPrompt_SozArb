## OCCUPATIONAL EMPLOYMENT AND WAGES - MAY 2024

Production occupations had employment of 8.7 million in May 2024, representing 5.7 percent of total national employment, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. The largest production occupations were miscellaneous assemblers and fabricators (1.5 million) and first-line supervisors of production and operating workers (685,140). (See chart 1.) The annual mean wage across all production occupations was $50,090, less than the U.S. average wage of $67,920. (See chart 2.)

The Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS) program provides employment and wage estimates for about 830 occupations in the nation, states, and approximately 530 areas. National data are available by industry for approximately 410 industry classifications and by ownership across all industries and for the educational services and hospitals industries. This news release features production, architecture and engineering, and building and grounds cleaning and maintenance occupations, in addition to largest occupations and public sector occupations. National employment and wage information for all occupations is shown in table 1.

## Production occupations

- The largest production occupations were miscellaneous assemblers and fabricators (1.5 million); first-line supervisors of production and operating workers (685,140); inspectors, testers, sorters, samplers, and weighers (591,180); and welders, cutters, solderers, and brazers (424,040). (See table 1 and chart 1.)
- The highest paying production occupations were nuclear power reactor operators ($122,830), power distributors and dispatchers ($109,620), and power plant operators ($95,990). (See table 1 and chart 2.)

## Changes to the Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS) Data

Effective with this news release, the OEWS program has implemented new metropolitan area definitions based on the 2020 decennial census and delineated by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). This news release does not include data for Colorado and its areas because of quality concerns with Colorado's Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) data. See the box notes at the end of this news release for more information.

## Introduction of New Metropolitan and Nonmetropolitan Area Definitions

With the May 2024 OEWS news release, the metropolitan area estimates have been updated to reflect definitions based on the 2020 decennial census and delineated in OMB Bulletin 23-01, available at www.bls.gov/bls/omb-bulletin-23-01-revised-delineations-of-metropolitan-statistical-areas.pdf. As a result of this update, new metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) have been added to publication, some existing MSAs have undergone name and/or compositional changes, and other existing areas have been removed from publication. Some nonmetropolitan areas have been added, removed, or modified due to the new MSA delineations. For the six New England states, New England City and Town Areas (NECTAs) have been discontinued, and OEWS now publishes the MSAs and nonmetropolitan areas for these states. A spreadsheet of the new OEWS area definitions is available at www.bls.gov/oes/area\_definitions\_m2024.xlsx.

## Suspension of Publication of Colorado Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics

On November 20, 2024, QCEW suspended publication of industry and substate data for Colorado because of data quality concerns caused by issues with the modernization of the state's unemployment insurance (UI) system. By February 19, 2025, the data quality concerns for Colorado had been sufficiently addressed to resume QCEW publication.

OEWS uses QCEW employment data-which provide comprehensive counts of nonfarm payroll employment-to adjust estimates to represent all employment that is in scope for the OEWS survey. The updated Colorado employment data were not available in time to be used in this OEWS news release. As a result, data in this news release do not include substate data for Colorado and its areas. Therefore, this news release only contains data for about 520 metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas instead of the full count of approximately 530 areas. The OEWS national data may be marginally impacted by the quality issues in Colorado.

## Technical Note

## Scope of the survey

The Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS) survey is a semiannual survey measuring occupational employment and wage  rates for wage and salary workers in nonfarm establishments  in  the  United  States.  The  OEWS  data  available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) include cross-industry occupational employment and wage estimates for the nation; states, the  District  of  Columbia,  and  Guam,  Puerto  Rico,  and  the  U.S. Virgin  Islands;  and  approximately  530  metropolitan  statistical areas  (MSAs)  and  nonmetropolitan  areas.  BLS  also  publishes national  industry-specific  estimates for  North  American  Industry Classification  System  (NAICS)  sector,  3-digit,  most  4-digit,  and selected 5- and 6-digit industry levels; and national estimates by ownership across all industries and for schools and hospitals.

The OEWS survey is a cooperative effort between BLS and the state workforce agencies (SWAs). BLS funds the survey and provides the  procedures  and  technical  support,  while  the SWAs collect most of the data. OEWS  estimates are constructed from a sample  of  about  1.1  million  establishments.  Each  year,  two semiannual panels of approximately 186,000 to 189,000 sampled establishments are contacted-one panel in May and the other in November. Responses are obtained by Internet or other electronic means, mail, email, telephone, or personal visit.  The  May  2024 estimates  are  based  on  responses  from  six  semiannual  panels collected over a 3-year period: May 2024, November 2023, May 2023,  November  2022,  May  2022,  and  November  2021.  The unweighted  sampled  employment  of  83.5  million  across  all  six semiannual  panels  represents  approximately  55  percent  of  total national employment. The overall national response rate for the six panels, based  on  the  50 states  and  the District  of Columbia, is 65.7 percent based on establishments and 65.9 percent based on weighted sampled employment.

## The occupational coding system

The May 2024 OEWS estimates contain approximately 830 occupational categories based on the Office of Management and Budget's 2018 Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) system.  These occupational categories make up 22 of the 23 SOC major  occupational  groups.  Major  group  55,  Military  Specific Occupations, is not included.

For more information about the SOC system, please see the BLS website at www.bls.gov/soc/.

## The industry coding system

The May 2024 OEWS estimates use the 2022 NAICS. For more information about NAICS, see the BLS  website at www.bls.gov/bls/naics.htm.

The OEWS survey excludes the majority of the agricultural sector, with  the exception of logging (NAICS 113310), support activities for crop production (NAICS 1151), and support activities for animal production (NAICS 1152). Private households (NAICS 814)  are also excluded. OEWS federal government data include the U.S. Postal Service and the federal executive branch only. All other industries, including state and local government, are covered by the survey.

## Area definitions

The May 2024 OEWS estimates use the metropolitan area definitions  in Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Bulletin 23-01. Nonmetropolitan area definitions are specific to the OEWS program  and  are  set  in  consultation  with  the  SWAs.  For  more information, see www.bls.gov/oes/area\_definitions\_m2024.xlsx.

## Survey sample

The OEWS survey draws its sample from state unemployment insurance (UI) files. Supplemental sources are used for rail transportation (NAICS 4821) and Guam because they do not report to the UI program. The OEWS survey sample is stratified by metropolitan and nonmetropolitan area, industry, and size.

To provide the most occupational coverage, larger employers are more likely to be selected than smaller employers. A census is taken of the executive branch of the federal government, the U.S. Postal Service, and state government.

## Concepts

Occupational employment is the estimate of total wage and salary employment in an occupation. The OEWS survey defines employment as the number of workers who can be classified as full- or part-time employees, including workers on paid vacations or other types of paid leave; workers on unpaid short-term absences; salaried  officers,  executives,  and  staff  members  of  incorporated firms; employees temporarily assigned to other units; and employees for  whom the  reporting  unit  is  their  permanent  duty station,  regardless  of  whether  that  unit  prepares  their  paycheck. The  survey  does  not  include  the  self-employed,  owners  and partners  in  unincorporated  firms,  household  workers,  or  unpaid family workers.

Wages for  the  OEWS  survey  are  straight-time,  gross  pay, exclusive  of  premium pay.  Base  rate;  cost-of-living  allowances; guaranteed  pay;  hazardous-duty  pay;  incentive  pay,  including commissions  and  production  bonuses;  and  tips  are  included. Excluded  are  overtime  pay,  severance  pay,  shift  differentials, nonproduction bonuses, employer cost for supplementary benefits, and tuition reimbursements.

The responding establishments are instructed to report hourly rates for part-time workers and to report annual rates for occupations that are typically paid at an annual rate but do not work 2,080 hours per year, such as teachers, pilots, and flight attendants. Other  workers,  such  as  some  entertainment  workers,  are  paid hourly rates, but generally do not work 40 hours per week, year round. For these workers, only an hourly wage is reported.

OEWS receives wage rate data for the federal government, the U.S. Postal Service, and most state government, local government, and private sector establishments. For the remaining establishments without wage rate data, the OEWS survey data were placed into 12 wage intervals. The intervals are defined both as hourly rates and the corresponding annual rates, where the annual rate for an occupation is calculated by multiplying the hourly wage rate by a typical work year of 2,080 hours.

## Estimation methodology

The  OEWS  survey  is  designed  to  produce  estimates  by combining six panels of data collected over a 3-year period. Each OEWS  panel  contains approximately 186,000 to 189,000 establishments. The full six-panel sample of 1.1 million establishments allows the production of estimates at detailed levels of geography, industry, and occupation.

The May 2024 estimates were produced by a model-based estimation  method  using  3  years  of  OEWS  data  (MB3).  Under MB3,  data  provided  by  survey  respondents  are  used  to  model occupational  staffing  patterns  and  wages  for  all  unobserved establishments  in  the  population,  including  establishments  that were not sampled, sampled establishments that did not respond, and respondents that did not meet stability criteria.

A  donor  pool  typically  consisting  of  10  nearest  neighbor responding establishments is used to predict data for each unobserved establishment; if 10 donors are not available, then as few as 5 can be used. Donors are matched to recipients based on detailed  industry,  geographic  area,  ownership,  size,  and  survey panel. Within a given donor pool, donors that are more similar to the unobserved establishment are given more weight in determining the modeled data.

Each establishment's population employment is set as the average of its May 2024 and November 2023 employment from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW), the UI database from  which the  OEWS  sample  is  drawn.  Using adjustment factors derived from the OEWS survey data, wages collected in earlier survey panels are adjusted to the reference date of  the  estimates  and  donor  wages  are  adjusted  for  differences between donor and recipient characteristics such as geographic area and industry.

## Changes and special procedures in the May 2024 estimates

With the May 2024 OEWS news release, the metropolitan area estimates have been updated to reflect definitions based on the 2020 decennial census and delineated in OMB Bulletin 23-01. As a result of this update, new MSAs were added to publication, some existing MSAs had name and/or compositional changes, and other MSAs were removed from publication. Some nonmetropolitan areas were also added, removed, or modified due to the new MSA delineations. For the six New England states, New England City and Town Areas (NECTAs) have been discontinued, and OEWS now publishes the MSAs and nonmetropolitan areas for these states.

On  November  20,  2024,  QCEW  suspended  publication of industry  and  substate  data  for  Colorado  because  of  data  quality concerns caused by issues with the modernization of the state's unemployment insurance (UI) system.  Because  the  QCEW microdata  are  fundamentally  a  byproduct  of  state  UI  systems, QCEW data quality is sensitive to changes in these systems. By February 19, 2025, the data quality concerns for Colorado had been sufficiently addressed to resume QCEW publication.

OEWS  uses  QCEW  employment  data-which  provide comprehensive counts of nonfarm payroll employment-to adjust estimates  to  represent  all  employment  that  is  in  scope  for  the OEWS survey. The updated Colorado employment data were not available in time to be used in this OEWS news release. As a result, data in this news release do not include substate data for Colorado and its areas. Therefore, this news release only contains data for about 520 metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas instead of the full  count of approximately 530 areas. The OEWS national data may be marginally impacted by the quality issues in Colorado.

1 Annual wages have been calculated by multiplying the hourly mean wage by a "year-round, full-time" hours figure of 2,080 hours; for those occupations where there is not an hourly mean wage published, the annual wage has been directly calculated from the reported survey data.

2 Wages for some occupations that do not generally work year-round, full time, are reported either as hourly wages or annual salaries, depending on how they are typically paid.

3 Represents a wage equal to or greater than $115.00 per hour.
