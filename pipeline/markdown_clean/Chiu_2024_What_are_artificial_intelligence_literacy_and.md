## Introduction

Artificial intelligence (AI) is the ability of a digital machine to carry out tasks that are typically performed by intelligent beings. Its technologies that support AI includes computer vision, speech-to-text, and natural language processing [7]. The advancements in AI are having profound effects on our daily lives, entertainment, education, and jobs. It  is  critical  to  expand  AI training beyond higher education and professionals. With the goal of preparing all citizens for AI based society, AI education  has  been  included  in  non-expert  community  around  the world, e.g., AI for all [24] and AI for K-12 [4,43]. We need all our young children to have good AI literacy and competency [3]. Therefore, AI education  for  K -12  is  a  global  initiative,  as  evidenced  in  UNESCO ' s

A B S T R A C T

Artificial intelligence (AI) education in K -12 schools is a global initiative, yet planning and executing AI education is challenging. The major frameworks are focused on identifying content and technical knowledge (AI literacy). Most of the current definitions of AI literacy for a non-technical audience are developed from an engineering perspective and may not be appropriate for K -12 education. Teacher perspectives are essential to making sense of this initiative. Literacy is about knowing (knowledge, what skills); competency is about applying the knowledge in a beneficial way (confidence, how well). They are strongly related. This study goes beyond knowledge (AI literacy), and its two main goals are to (i) define AI literacy and competency by adding the aspects of confidence and self-reflective mindsets, and (ii) propose a more comprehensive framework for K -12 AI education.  These  definitions  are  needed  for  this  emerging  and  disruptive  technology  (e.g.,  ChatGPT  and  Sora, generative AI). We used the definitions and the basic curriculum design approaches as the analytical framework and  teacher  perspectives.  Participants  included  30  experienced  AI  teachers  from  15  middle  schools.  We employed an iterative co-design cycle to discuss and revise the framework throughout four cycles. The definition of AI competency has five abilities that take confidence into account, and the proposed framework comprises five key components: technology, impact, ethics, collaboration, and self-reflection. We also identify five effective learning  experiences  to  foster  abilities  and  confidences,  and  suggest  five  future  research  directions:  prompt engineering, data literacy, algorithmic literacy, self-reflective mindset, and empirical research.

report on AI education. On the other hand, unlike in higher education, designing K -12 education must take into account implementation and variety  in  delivery.  To  address  the  global  initiative,  a  few  major frameworks  were  proposed  for  researchers  and  educators  [4,42,43]. They focus on identifying content and knowledge for AI teaching and learning.  They  are  very  important  at  the  beginning  of  this  initiative because researchers and educators did not know what to include in the AI curriculum. However, AI education is more than content, because it addresses the learning outcomes (i.e., What are AI literacy and competency?) and experiences (i.e. How to nurture them?) [5,27,34].

Literature has defined and suggested what AI literacy is for non-AI professionals (e.g., [29,31]). Younger children might not benefit from the definition that was developed via an engineering perceptive. Long

and Margerko [31] stated that their definition needs to be reviewed in the future as research on AI education is still in its early stages. The technologies are emerging and disruptive, such as ChatGPT and Sora. These  generative  AI  tools  keep  humans  learning  [9].  Therefore,  this study argues that (i) the concepts of self-reflective mindsets should be included  in  the  definition  of  AI  literacy  (i.e.,  AI  competency),  and practitioner perspectives should be taken into account for designing and developing  K -12  AI  education.  Moreover,  the  two  basic  curriculum design approaches -process and praxis -describe how to nurture student  literacy  [20].  Accordingly,  the  primary  goal  of  this  study  is  to propose  a  framework  for  K -12  teachers  to  promote  AI  literacy  and competency. This comprehensive framework explains core knowledge (the content) and pedagogy (the process of learning) that help students improve their AI literacy and competency (learning outcomes). In order to  accomplish  this  goal,  we  defined  AI  literacy  and  competency  and co-designed the framework with teachers. Since the learning needs of adults who have not received AI education are comparable to those of K -12  students,  the  framework  can  be  applied  to  both  non-AI  professionals and K -12 students, i.e., AI for All and AI for K -12. The findings  of  this  study  will  contribute  to  AI  education  by  enhancing  our knowledge of AI literacy and competency for K -12 students. Researchers and practitioners would use the definition and theoretical framework suggested  by  the  findings  to  design  research  and  learning  activities related to AI literacy and competency.

## Literature review

This study ' s conceptual framework is comprised of our definition of AI literacy and competency, as well as two approaches to curriculum design:  praxis  and  process.  The  definition  offers  suggestions  for  the content and learning outcomes that should be incorporated in K -12 AI education; the two approaches recommend that effective pedagogies be used. The terms AI literacy and competency were initially defined in this section, along with the two approaches to curriculum design -process and praxis -discussed.  Next  comes the  critical  discussion  of  relevant papers on the AI education framework in order to identify research gaps.

## AI literacy and competency

Initially, literacy refers to specific ways of thinking about and performing reading and writing in order to comprehend or express ideas or thoughts in writing within a particular context of use [26]. Digital literacy refers to the ability to appropriately use, assess, and apply digital tools, resources, and services to lifelong learning processes [17]. Clearly, digital competency encompasses more than just proficiency in operating devices and programs; it is also closely intertwined with the ability to communicate using technologies and digital skills. It should include a balanced view of technology for responsible and healthy use of digital technology. Knowledge and attitudes about privacy and security, legal and ethical considerations, and the role of digital technologies in society should be included [17]. Therefore, literacy is directly tied to skills and is  more  about  knowing.  Beyond  that,  competency  is  the  ability  to perform a task effectively and successfully [17]. Broadly speaking, literacy is more about knowing, and competency is more about applying the knowledge in an effective and beneficial way. It is related to confidence and attitude, and focuses on how well an AI user does.

Long and Magerko [31] define AI literacy as ' a set of competencies that enables individuals to critically evaluate AI technologies, communicate and collaborate effectively with AI, and use AI as a tool online, at home, and in the workplace. ' They see this literacy as a set of 17 skills and as an operational definition. AI literacy is clearly related to other literacy such as digital, data, and computational literacy. The relationships could be mutually dependent but exclusive [31]. For example, AI literacy requires users to have a fundamental understanding of how to utilize computers in order to comprehend AI. Therefore, digital literacy, which refers to the ability to use computers to complete a task [33], is a prerequisite for AI literacy. Considering the close connection between data and machine learning (a branch of AI), data literacy refers to the capacity to understand, work with, evaluate, and argue with data as part of a more comprehensive process of inquiry into the world [45], which largely  overlaps with  AI  literacy.  Moreover,  the  other  two  literacies, such as computational and scientific, may not closely relate to AI literacy.  Computational  literacy  involves  exploring  and  communicating ideas through code [44]; therefore, it is not necessarily a prerequisite for AI literacy that does not require writing codes to understand how AI works. Similarly, AI literacy does not require scientific literacy, which refers to an appreciation of the nature, contributions, and basic limitations of science [22]. The definition of AI literacy is one of the first for non-AI professionals, which could give K -12 educators and researchers new insights about the content and skill assessments related to AI. Its development was based on a literature review done by two engineering professors. Most of the literature was published at engineering conferences around 2018 -2019. These imply that this definition is driven by an engineering perspective and higher education. The definition may not be appropriate for K -12 education, which is supported by the major limitations of this definition raised by the authors [31]. They noted that AI education is still in its early stages and requires additional empirical studies, especially on teacher perspectives, to get a robust and accurate understanding of AI literacy for a non-technical audience [31]. Moreover, in the definition, the terms of literacy and competence were mixed use in the literature (e.g., [31]). However, as we discussed literacy and competency  are  related  but  different  in  educational  research  [17]. Therefore, it is necessary to redefine AI literacy and competency.

## Process and praxis design approaches in AI education context

Adopting  a  specific  curriculum  design  strategy  has  a  significant impact  on  teaching  and  learning  processes  [38].  The  four  basic  approaches to curriculum design are content, product, process, and praxis. The content approach views education as knowledge transmission, e.g., a syllabus with defined content [20,27]; the curriculum as product views teaching as grading and focuses on student performance [20,27], i.e., student learning outcomes. It often creates lists of competences, telling students what to learn and how to learn it, and emphasizes education with pre-defined outcomes. In AI education, these two approaches are informed by the definition of AI literacy and competency.

Instead  of  pre-defined  content  and  outcomes,  the  process  design approach stresses how teachers, students, and content adapt, and it also views  teaching  as  development.  Triadic  interactions  change  learning goals [27]. The curriculum is a guide to teaching, not a set of items for instructors to cover and deliver [20]. Content is tailored to the needs and interests of the students; learning outcomes are determined by teachers and students but are not universally applicable. This approach values student-centered learning experiences. To make sense of what is being learned, the praxis design approach places a focus on how it may be used in  the  real  world.  Students,  under  the  supervision  of  their  teachers, collaborate on solutions to real-world problems and develop a strategy for learning the necessary material and obtaining the desired outcomes. Both the process of learning and its outcomes are constantly assessed. Therefore, problem-based learning is often adopted. AI education is still new to  schools;  its  process  and  praxis  approaches  are  not  clear  and require more empirical research.

Overall,  the  first  two  approaches  create  a  set  of  documents  for implementation, and the last two approaches advocate student-centered approaches,  shifting  the  focus  of  the  curriculum  from  teaching  to learning [27]. Therefore, the definitions of AI literacy and competency and teacher perspectives on pedagogies would contribute to the development of an AI education framework for K -12.

## Three major frameworks for AI education in K-12

A  few  key  frameworks  were  suggested  in  the  AI  K -12  education

GLYPH&lt;0&gt;2GLYPH&lt;0&gt;SGLYPH&lt;0&gt;HGLYPH&lt;0&gt;Q

research in the past 5 years. One of the first frameworks, known as ' Five Big Ideas in AI, ' was suggested by Touretzky et al. [43]. In 2018, there was little external guidance from the literature on the content and scope of AI education for K -12 students [42]. The AI4K12 Steering Committee, which  consists  of  David  Touretzky,  Christina  Gardner-McCune,  Fred Martin, and Deborah Seehorn, began their work by coming up with a list.  This  list  serves  as  the  organizing  framework  for  the  guidelines, which are developed based on the CSTA Computing Standards. Those standards are structured around the same five core ideas [11]. The five big ideas are:

- Perception:  Computers use sensors to get information about their environment. Understanding what the senses are trying to tell us is what we call perception.
- Representation and Reasoning: Agents keep models of the world and utilize them to make decisions. Representations are the driving force behind reasoning, and reasoners use them.
- Learning: Computers can keep learning from data. By modifying the representations within a decision tree or neural network, a machine learning algorithm creates a reasoner.
- Natural Interaction: To communicate with people in a natural way, intelligent agents need access to a wide range of information. The information includes common sense, culture, human emotions, and knowledge of language.
- Societal Impact: There will be positive and negative effects of AI on society. The topics include the economic effects of automation, the fairness  and  transparency  of  automated  decision-making  systems, cultural considerations of AI algorithms, and the use of AI for social good.

These big ideas help educators and researchers set the goals of their designed AI education and identify the content needed. Accordingly, this framework used content and product approaches.

The second framework discussed was proposed by Chiu et al. [8] in their project AI4future. Education and engineering professors co-designed the framework with school teachers for middle school students. Fig. 1 shows an infographic presenting their proposed AI curriculum.  In  the  core  of  the  circle,  the  curriculum  begins  with  an introduction to AI -big data, machine learning, and cloud computing. Another major focus is on ethical issues in the usage of AI applications as well as their societal impact. The middle pink circle depicts our coverage of various branches of AI: perceptual machine intelligence, e.g., ' see ' and "hear," human language technologies, e.g., ' speak ' and ' read and write," integrated intelligences, e.g., machine reasoning, simulation for problem solving, and content creation and generation. The outside green circle  depicts  many  AI-supported  applications,  many  of  which  have significant societal ramifications, particularly for the future workforce. Similarly, the first framework also focuses on content and product approaches,  helping  AI  educators  create  their  learning  and  teaching content.

The  last  framework  was  drawn  from  teachers ' perspectives  in  a school-university partnership project. Chiu [6] added pedagogy to the framework; see Fig. 3. The framework has three layers, shown in light blue, white, and dark blue. The core of the model in light blue shows the three core content components that should be included in AI education for middle school students. The content components are what AI is, how AI processes data, and what impact AI has. The middle layer in white suggests three pedagogies: student relevance, teacher-student communication, and flexibility. They are essential for the effective teaching of AI concepts and knowledge. Students should feel relevant when learning

AI, as it is around students ' lives. Students should use design solutions for  authentic  problems.  In  teacher-student  communication,  teachers should utilize unfamiliar graphics and consistent language to convey AI terminologies and algorithms since they are too new and abstract for young children. This language is more likely to foster teacher-student communication.  The  last  component  is  flexibility.  Teachers  can  use module and level-up content that provides a learning pathway that directs and guides learning. The last layer in dark blue is the outcome of AI education. The model used the roles of students in an AI-based society. The  outcomes  include  AI  users,  developers,  researchers,  and  ethical designers. The approach makes the outcomes explicit to students. The process approach was added to the framework.

## Research gaps

These  three  frameworks  are  significant  as  they  set  the  content knowledge school students need to learn and suggest pedagogies for teachers.  However,  they  were  developed  at  an  early  stage  [31].  AI learning for K -12 should provide education equality, reducing the digital divide [46]. Literacy (knowing) and competency (how well you do) are related, but different [17]. Literature on AI education interchanges the terms AI literacy and competency (e.g., [31]). We frequently settle with literacy instead of striving for competency since it requires less effort. AI education should focus on AI competency due to its disruptive nature. With the advent of generative AI tools such as ChatGPT and Sora, AI  literacy  and  competency  need  to  be  revisited  [3].  Self-reflective mindsets  and  life-long  learning  skills  are  important  to  AI  education. Therefore, it is necessary to re-examine these three pieces of work for a more comprehensive framework from the perspective of experienced AI K -12  teachers, as  teacher perspectives could  refine the existing frameworks.

## This study and method

## Research goal

The two main goals of this paper are to (i) define AI literacy and competency for a non-technical audience, i.e., K -12 education, and (ii) suggest  a  more  comprehensive  framework  for  AI  education.  How teachers design AI teaching and learning activities directly impacts how and what students learn. Teachers ' perspectives are crucial for making sense of any innovative education [14]. Accordingly, to achieve these two goals, we first presented the definitions of AI literacy and competency and co-designed the framework with experienced AI teachers. The definitions  and  the  curriculum  design  approaches  serve  as  a  lens  to reexamine the three major frameworks available in the literature.

## The definitions of AI literacy and competency

Long  and  Magerko ' s  [31]  definition  of  AI  literacy  is  exceedingly broad, possibly overly complicated, and unsuitable for the K -12 setting. The inclusion of self-reflective mindsets, which are critical for lifelong learning about emerging AI technology, in the definition was missing. AI technologies are expected to stay, evolve, and have an increasing impact on our lives,  work,  and  studies.  More  students  will  learn  with  more advanced AI technologies; more employees will work with  the technologies; and more people will live with the technologies. To succeed in the AI age, students must be able to continuously evaluate their own understanding of AI and stay up-to-date on its advancements. This is in line with the recommendations made by UNESCO about AI competency for educators and students: ' The knowledge, skills, and attitudes students should acquire to understand and actively engage with AI in a safe and ethical manner in school and beyond. ' .

This study revised the definition of AI literacy to improve its suitability for K -12 education and defined AI competency by adding the aspects of student confidence and self-reflective mindsets to AI literacy,

## as follows:

- AI literacy is defined as ' an individual ' s  ability to clearly explain how AI technologies work and impact society, as well as to use them in an ethical and responsible manner and to effectively communicate and collaborate with them in any setting. It focuses on knowing (i.e. knowledge and skills). ' .
- AI competency is defined as ' an individual ' s confidence and ability to clearly explain how AI technologies work and impact society, as well as  to  use  them  in  an  ethical  and  responsible  manner  and  to effectively communicate and collaborate with them in any setting. They should have the confidence and ability to self-reflect on their AI understanding  for  further  learning.  It  focuses  on  how  well  individuals use AI in beneficial ways. ' .

In this paper, we used technology, impact, ethics, collaboration, and self-reflection to label the confidences and abilities in the definition of AI competency to analyze the data collected, as follows:

- Technology: confidence and ability to clearly explain how AI technologies work
- Impact: confidence and ability to clearly explain how AI technologies impact society
- Ethics: confidence and ability to use AI technologies in an ethical and responsible manner
- Collaboration:  confidence  and  ability  to  effectively  communicate and collaborate with AI technologies in any setting
- Self-reflection: confidence and ability to self-reflect on their AI understanding  for  further  learning.  Individuals  with  stronger  selfreflective  mindsets  are  more  likely  to  keep  reviewing  their  AI knowledge and identify areas and needs for further learning.

## Participants

There were a total of 30 teacher participants involved in this study, split  evenly  between  15  Hong  Kong  middle  schools  (2  teachers  per school). The teachers ' average age was 32, and there were 24 male and 6 female participants. All of them had at least three years of experience teaching AI. Their academic backgrounds included computer science, mathematics, the sciences, business, design, and technology. Each district had its own set of schools, which ranged in academic quality and social status. Another key participant was a researcher who is a professoriate staff member with an academic background in STEM education, particularly in mathematics and technology. The researcher has five  years  of  experience  promoting  AI  education  in  middle  schools through the creation of learning materials, testing their effectiveness, and providing teacher training. By considering that AI education for K -12 has started in 2019, the participants were experienced.

## Research design and procedure

This study used a co-design approach to propose the framework. The researcher was involved in the design processes and worked together with the teachers. An iterative co-design cycle involving data collection, analysis,  and  design  was  conducted.  The  researcher  and  teachers contributed  to  the  development  of  the  comprehensive  framework through the definitions, design  approaches, and three existing major frameworks discussed in the literature review.

The main researcher began running a 3-hour workshop on the four approaches, the three major frameworks, and the definitions of AI literacy and competency for all the teachers. There were four cycles of data collection. In each cycle, the researcher conducted a meeting with the teachers and collected their comments. The teachers were divided into five groups of six and drafted and revised the framework and learning experiences from the previous cycle (the first cycle used the three major frameworks discussed in the review). Each meeting lasted for 4 h with a

T.K.F. Chiu et al.

15-minute break. Thus, the researcher and the participants jointly proposed  how  AI  education  should  be  designed  and  delivered,  and  the teachers used the materials as evidence to support their ideas.

## Analyses, reliability and validity

In each of the meetings (i.e., cycles), all the participants co-designed the framework and learning experience with the researcher. At the end of  each  cycle,  the  teacher  participants  voted  on  the  changes  to  the framework and learning experiences using an immediate response digital platform. We used a 75 percent agreement (consensus) level, aligned with previous similar studies [41]. This level indicates the high reliability of the analysis.

We used six aspects to discuss the validity of this qualitative design and analysis [15,30]. Appropriateness: First, we used the three major existing AI education frameworks in the literature. Second, the main researcher has designed and delivered AI education for K -12 since 2018 and published more than 15 journal papers related to AI education. The participants were experienced AI education teachers. These show that the methods and materials used for gathering data were suitable for the context and research question. Triangulation: the teachers with different teaching subjects and schools were recruited to avoid individual (subject) biases and provide a more diverse view. Credibility: The credibility of qualitative research is determined by the researcher ' s competence in the research process. The authors had experience researching, designing, and teaching AI in different regions. Ethical procedures: The corresponding authors ' university  granted ethical  permission  for  this work, addressing the moral implications of this date collection. All the participants understood their rights and gave consent. Transferability: the participants ' major teaching subjects were diverse, which provides a wide  possible  range  of  data.  Respondent  validation:  this  study  was supported by the three major AI education frameworks; thereby, it is credible and valid.

## Results and discussions

The confidences and abilities and four curriculum design approaches were employed as a conceptual framework in this study to analyze the data obtained in each cycle. The first two meetings have identified the five  key  components  of  the  proposed  comprehensive  framework;  see Fig.  3.  They  are  technology,  impact,  ethics,  collaboration,  and  selfreflection. Each of the findings is explained in detail below.

## The five components in the comprehensive framework

## Technology

The first component concerns the core knowledge of AI, which is comparable to the two frameworks proposed by Five Big Ideas in AI and AI4future [4,43]. Content is critical for the design of universal education,  i.e.,  K -12.  K-12  education,  unlike  higher  education,  requires boundaries. Different schools in the same region must work on the same learning objectives. According to the teachers, core knowledge includes three topics: basic components, perception, and applications.

- In the basic components, the definition, history, and development of AI should be taught in schools [49]. The following definition of AI was agreed upon by all the participants: ' AI refers to a machine ' s ability to do tasks equivalent to human learning and decision-making. ' . This definition is consistent with the findings of Chiu et al. [8] and Touretzky et al. [42]. The students must understand essential concepts such as big data, machine learning, and cloud computing. They must understand the five primary and inherent characteristics of big data, which are velocity, volume, value, variety, and veracity [19]. To properly understand how AI machines use data to enhance their skills, the topic of machine learning should encompass training models and learning algorithms [4,10]. Cloud computing is required

for huge data processing in order to better train models and/or algorithms. Furthermore, the history and development of AI are critical  topics  in  K -12.  All  the  participants  agreed  that  the  students should understand AI history as well as contemporary advancements such as the ' fourth industrial revolution ' and generative AI, e.g., ChatGPT and Sora [12,49]. The students must comprehend how AI machines  differ  from  non-AI  machines.  Non-AI  machines,  for example, have been designed to answer our problems by applying rules or algorithms, whereas AI machines use data to develop and regenerate the rules or models. They should understand that AI is changing the fundamental concept of how machines work and that ' data are the new code ' [49]. The students who have mastered the essential knowledge, in particular, should be able to recognize if the technologies they are employing are AI and comprehend the ramifications of this. They should also be required to describe what types of data AI collects, how AI analyzes data, and how AI learns from data.

- Perception is the second topic in core knowledge, which is consistent with the research of Chiu et al. [8] and Touretzky et al. [42]. The teachers indicated that the concept of perception in Touretzky et al. study [42] is too abstract. The students did not understand what this word meant. They chose human sensor concepts as perception subtopics. Human sensors -see, read, and write; speak and hear; think and create; reason and simulate -are terms that reflect the definition of  AI.  Because  these  terminologies  are  not  overly  technical,  both students and teachers will understand what they need to learn or teach. The students should understand how each sensor collects and processes data.
- The third topic is AI applications. The teachers highlighted that the topic ' s  breadth  is  more  significant  than  its  depth.  The  students should  have  a  thorough  understanding  of  AI  applications,  which should  include  most  industries  or  aspects  of  daily  life  such  as healthcare,  entertainment,  transport,  logistics,  etc.  They  should employ perception to describe how each application functions, as well  as  machine  learning  to  construct  and  develop  their  own  AI applications.

## Impact

The second key component suggests three topics that foster student confidence and ability to clearly explain AI technologies impact on society: future of work, social good, and risks.

- On the topic of the future of work, young children place a high value on their future studies and employment. They need to understand that  more  future  vocations  demand  AI  literacy  and  that  they  are increasingly likely to learn with AI in their lives and work with AI in their jobs.
- The second subtopic is AI for social good. AI can have both positive and harmful effects on society. According to the teachers, the students should learn how AI solves complicated issues by addressing critical  social,  environmental,  and  public  health  concerns  [23]. Other than the benefits AI brings to society, students should also learn the risks.
- The last topic is risk. All the participants agreed that the students should  be  aware  of  the  potential  risks  associated  with  AI.  They should  investigate  how  emerging  technologies  cause  trouble  and harm in various contexts. These are aligned with the two frameworks [4,43] and other related studies [47,50].

## Ethics

The third component is ethics, and there are concerns about AI ethics and  human  bias.  The  teachers  discussed  which  concepts  should  be included in K -12 education. Existing principles or policies published for the public are very complicated. Some of them were used for legal and business purposes. They expressed that ' the AI policies include 20 areas for ethical use. ' They are too complicated for young children or non-

technical audiences. The teachers finally used IBM AI ethical principles as a starting point and reached a consensus on what to include in this topic. They chose five of them because they are more relevant to school students:  fairness  and  biases;  trust  and  transparency;  accountability; social benefit; and privacy and security [18].

## Collaboration

The fourth component is to foster student confidence and ability to communicate and collaborate with AI technologies in any setting. The teacher participants pointed out that these confidence and ability were associated with the three themes discussed earlier: technology, impact, and  ethics.  They  suggested  that ' the  students  need  to  learn  how  to prompt effectively when using ChatGPT, '  ' the students should examine the reliability of the prediction of an AI prediction system, '  ' the students should be aware of their privacy rights when using AI systems, ' and ' the students should be aware that AI systems may collect their data, such as locations and voices. ' This is likely to be fostered through case studies, project-based learning, and hands-on activities. Overall, this is aligned with some studies about prompt engineering, which is the technique of structuring  text  so  that  a  generative  AI  model  can  comprehend  and understand it. The promoter is a natural language text that enables more appropriate responses from the model [32,35].

## Self-reflection

The  last  key  component  concerns  student  self-reflective  mindsets that are strongly associated with confidence. A confident student is more inclined to consistently self-reflect on their AI knowledge compared to a less confident learner. Since AI is an emerging and disruptive technology, it is critical that the students constantly evaluate their knowledge of AI in order to stay up-to-date. This is cognitive but affected by its affective or emotional aspects, since cognitive engagement is associated with emotional engagement [4]. For example, students who are more enthusiastic about AI or technology are more likely to read articles and watch videos about the latest developments in AI-related technology [2, 50]. This is very important for lifelong learning skills in an AI-based society.

The last two meetings in the study focused on discussing the process and praxis-based design approaches. The teachers reached a consensus that five essential learning experiences should be taken into account when designing AI teaching and learning activities.

## Five essential learning experiences

Five  learning  experiences  for  AI  education  were  identified  in  the meetings.  All  the  teachers  agreed  that  experience  is  essential  for  AI learning.  The  following  discusses  how  learning  experiences  promote inclusive and diverse AI education.

- Community engagement: According to Cooper [13] and Mooney &amp; Edwards [36], integrating student learning with the community is a purposeful  pedagogical  strategy  used  by  instructors  to  make  a connection between what is taught in the classroom and the students ' local communities. As a result, students can apply their ideas based on personal observation and social interaction to design and find solutions to real-world problems in a community. They are more inclined to invest more in learning since the challenges are more relevant  and  encourage  student  participation.  This  community involvement  will  increase  students ' interest  and  enthusiasm  [1,7, 28], resulting in more inclusive and diverse AI education [46]. This community involvement will promote AI for social good while also cultivating students ' positive attitudes toward AI. Furthermore, the teachers  stated  that  the  design  thinking  approach -empathize, define,  ideate,  prototype,  and  test -should be used to solve community problems. To have a greater impact, community participation may learn a lot from design thinking [4].
- Global and local case studies: One of the effective teaching methods proposed by the teachers is using media articles to educate about AI ethics and impact. School students can read various web articles, yet there  are  many  biased  options  or  fake  news  [16].  They  are  less mature  and  less  capable  of  judging  the  reliability  of  the  articles. Unlike ten years ago, more newspaper stories are being published as a  result  of  AI  advancement.  They  have  recently  become  more accessible  to  both  teachers  and  students.  This  method  creates non-textbook learning, making it more authentic and relevant. Students can more actively reflect on ethical issues raised in newspaper stories [40]. Furthermore, this teaching style can be utilized to teach ethical principles while emphasizing the importance of data sources. This can be used by teachers to illustrate concepts such as fairness and bias, trust and transparency, and accountability.
- Hands-on activities: Students are surrounded by AI, but not so much in  their  classrooms.  Hands-on  activities  could  help  students  learn perception better because they put them more in the driver ' s seat through physical activity and active learning [48]. Physically active learning can support students ' confidence and ability to model the world and generate creative ideas [48]. These connections may allow multipart  tool  design  and  use.  Students  can  solve  problems  they cannot solve orally or visually by modeling physical systems with their hands [46]. Asking students to use their hands to model physical phenomena using AI will develop their conceptual understanding  of  AI  perception.  The  teachers  also  suggested  some  practical ideas: students could investigate how AI can collect, understand, and identify images, i.e., learn how computers see images. Students can understand what they read and write since AI understands languages and text, and they can develop text analyzers to detect text moods. Furthermore, most students believe AI and robotics are the same technology. Students should learn how AI differs from robotics by doing a hands-on project in which they build a robot with reasoning and perception. According to the teachers, ethical principles, which were  often  taught  using  case-study  approaches,  can  be  taught through  hands-on  activities.  Students  could  design  one  or  more biased AI apps and explain how the dataset selection resulted in the biased  results.  As  a  result,  hands-on  activities  can  better  cater  to students with individual and learning differences and promote inclusive and diverse AI education [46].
- Exhibitions  and  presentations:  This  strategy  is  prevalent  in  the dissemination of student work, particularly in project-based learning. It allows students to consolidate their learning by communicating their processes, thinking about their products, and reflecting on their answers [21]. Teachers indicated in this framework that students should display their learning process and project work. The teacher highlighted in AI education that students should use core knowledge as criteria to present their work in the exhibition. For example, how did they acquire or create the data for building the perception? Are the data ethical? Is their use moral? What is the social impact of their work? What industry will acquire their products? Accordingly, presenting their project work encourages students to tap into their individual differences.
- Cultural learning: Human values and culture should be considered when learning AI. Data may be biased due to how it is obtained or chosen for usage. Human values and culture play a significant role in this. The answer to the questionAI bias or not ' " may not be determined by AI knowledge but by human values and culture. These two elements  must  be  considered  by  students  while  learning  AI.  For example, when developing AI projects to help the elderly, students are obliged to respect their culture and values (e.g., food and diets) but  not  change  theirs.  When  discussing  ethical  issues  related  to driverless cars, students must be aware of local laws and religious beliefs (hurting cows in India may result in serious crimes).

Overall, the teachers ' recommendations for five essential learning experiences would enhance inclusive and diverse AI education through

social good (community participation), students ' relevancy (newspaper articles), active learning (hands-on  activities), collaboration,  and communication (presentation) (Fig. 2).

## Future research directions and recommendations

Compared to the existing major frameworks for AI K -12 education, this  framework  has  two  newly  added  aspects -confidence  and  selfreflective mindsets -and two newly added abilities: (i) collaboration: ability to effectively communicate and collaborate with AI technologies in any setting; (ii) self-reflection: ability to self-reflect their AI understanding  for  further  learning.  This  paper  focuses  on  discussing  five future research directions to address these confidences and abilities.

- Prompt  engineering:  In  this  new  technique,  you  may  rephrase  a query, select a style, provide more contextual information, or assign a role to AI when interacting with AI [32,35]. The current studies on this technique are restricted to ChatGPT. This is also related to our questioning skills. Most of the young children ' s questioning skills are developed in K -12 education. More studies should be conducted to understand how K -12 students interact with AI, i.e., prompt engineering or questioning skills for AI.
- Data science education: how to communicate with AI is associated with who to use and interpret data. Data literacy is strongly associated with AI literacy [31]. Data science education and data literacy may need to be included in K -12 education. Currently, this literacy is embedded in mathematics or AI subjects. More studies should be conducted  to  investigate  how  data  literacy  relates  to  AI  literacy development.
- Algorithmic  Literacy:  To  fully  communicate  with  AI,  algorithmic literacy  may  be  needed.  This  literacy  includes  awareness  and knowledge of algorithms, trust and confidence in algorithms, algorithm appreciation, and algorithm avoidance [25] This framework did not discuss this literacy. Future studies should be conducted to define algorithmic literacy and how it affects AI literacy.
- Self-reflective mindsets: this mindset is understudied in AI education. AI is different from other typical subjects, such as mathematics and sciences in K -12,  and is  emerging. Social cognitive theory is related to emotional engagement, and self-regulated learning concerns self-reflection. Future studies are recommended to use social cognitive  theory  and  self-regulated  learning  to  identify  effective pedagogies to nurture students ' self-reflective mindsets.
- Empirical research: AI education is still new; more empirical studies should  be  conducted  to  refine  the  definition  of  AI  literacy  and competency and the AI education framework.

## Conclusion and limitations

Designing  an  effective  AI  education  in  K -12  appears  to  be  quite difficult.  A few frameworks -"Five Big Ideas in AI," AI4future, and a holistic  approach -were  presented  in  the  literature  to  help  teachers create their curriculum. They do, however, concentrate on recognizing AI content, tools, technical abilities, and thinking. They may not properly  provide  them  with  a  fundamental  understanding  and  get  them ready for a future with AI. To address this issue, this study defined AI competency  by  adding  the  aspects  of  confidence  and  self-reflective mindsets to AI literacy and proposed a comprehensive framework for AI education in K -12. We believe that the framework promotes inclusive and diverse education, ensuring success for each student [39]. Teachers can design AI education to address students ' needs [37].

We acknowledge two limitations in this study. First, the framework has  not  been  put  through  its  paces  in  the  field,  so  more  research  is needed to investigate its usefulness. One way to do this would be to have a variety of schools (including those serving students with special needs) use the framework as a guide for developing and executing AI education initiatives. Second, this study did not address how teacher capacity affects learning design and development, which is a major limitation given that most teachers do not study AI topics in their education and undergo formal AI training. Learning how to design and implement AI teacher professional programs and the impact they have on learning design is an important area for future research.
