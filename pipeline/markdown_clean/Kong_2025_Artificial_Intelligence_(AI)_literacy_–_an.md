## ABSTRACT

'Perhaps  we  should  all  stop  for  a  moment  and  focus  not  only  on making our AI better and more successful but also on the benefit of humanity'. - S. Hawkins, Web Summit, 2017

This international collaborative piece argues for a paradigm shift in our use and understanding of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education,  and  in  the  development  of  Artificial  Intelligence  Literacy amongst our learners  and  professional  colleagues.  The  main  premises are:

- AI can change societal practices, and aid competency and capacity building within society, thereby having a positive impact on education.
- AI  in  education  can  support  equity,  inclusiveness  and  lifelong learning,  through  customisable  and  tailored  learning  experiences, while building up future professions and societies according to sustainable development premises.
- Education ought to equip learners with the knowledge, competency and mindset required to use AI to solve professional and societal challenges and improve day-to-day practices

## Introduction

The growing impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on people from all walks of life demands that the education sector addresses AI and AI literacy at all educational levels. Not only do we aim to nurture future professionals who are ready and able to harness AI to solve reallife  problems,  we  also  believe  that  AI  can  help  to  create  sustainable  and  equitable societies. It is paramount, therefore, to equip people with the necessary knowledge, skills and mindset to utilise the potential of AI. In essence, this is AI literacy for the current and future workforce, enabling them to adapt to the AI era not just as passive observers but as

active  participants,  able  to  solve  global  challenges  through  the  use  of  AI  (Edwards  &amp; Cheok, 2018).

## What is AI and AI literacy?

Recent  years  have  seen  an  explosive  development  of  AI  and  its  societal  impacts,  in particular  through  machine  learning  Artificial  Intelligence  (AI)  and  deep  learning algorithms,  meaning  that  the  developed  technology  is  intelligent,  has  situational awareness and the ability to adapt accordingly to ensure the best possible outcomes. A  conceptual  understanding  of  AI  would  mean  that  learners  comprehend  the  underlying  concepts  and  logic  of  AI  algorithms,  and  how  those  algorithms  can  be  adapted and  developed  into  solutions  to  real-life  challenges,  including  the  improvement of  day-to-day  processes,  improved  efficiencies  and  productivity,  and  enhancements in  creativity.

The  fact  that  AI  can  adapt  to  changing  situations  makes  it  a  great  resource  for education in both classrooms and online, as it enables the customisation of pedagogy to learners' cognitive processes, according to their individual abilities and needs (Long &amp; Magerko, 2020). For instance, the recent pandemic provides a compelling argument for this  approach  with  the  successful  use  of  AI  and  blockchain  in  the  healthcare  industry (Sarfraz et al., 2021).

As AI-based technologies used in education increase, the development of AI  literacy becomes essential (Figure 1). AI literacy can be understood as the competency to use AI at home, at school, in work and online, and utilise it for collaboration and critical evaluation (Long &amp; Magerko, 2020). AI literacy focuses on the ability to apply AI in real-life scenarios, for  example  to  facilitate  problem  solving.  To  popularise  AI  literacy  and  promote  it  in education and thereby in the current and future workforce, it is necessary to focus on the conceptual  understanding  of  AI.  This  is  needed  to  promote  active  citizenship,  and develop  and  increase  workforces'  diverse  competency,  instead  of  focusing  perhaps  on complex programming and mathematical skills (Kong et al., 2021, 2022).

## Why do citizens need AI education and AI literacy?

There is a significant mismatch between skills taught in schools and those needed in the age of AI in workplaces and the society (UNESCO, 2022). As AI is rapidly expanding across industries, there are necessary calls for educational initiatives at all levels and specialisms to  rise  to  the  emergence  of  this  paradigm  shift  (Lee  et  al.,  2021).  Also,  United  Nations Sustainable Development Goal 4 (quality education) explicitly refers to equality concerning rural, vulnerable, indigenous and other minority groups, and it is evident that AI could be of considerable assistance in contributing to these global challenges, including these groups' culture and language revitalisation (Figure 1). In this light, the indicator 4.6.1 (UN SDG) regarding the significance of proficiency in functional literacy is particularly meaningful,  as  it  is  defined  as  the  capacity  to  effectively function  not  only in  one´s group or community, but also enables one to develop their community.

AI  in  education  can  significantly  support  diverse  learners  through  customisable  and tailored  approaches  to  learning,  making  its  role  distinct  from  face  to  face  and  online learning, but also mutually supportive. This means that learners will be able to proceed at

their  own  pace  and  at  their  own  level.  This  is  also  consistent  with  the  Sustainable Development Goals. Furthermore, AI in education will become both our and the future generations' lifelong learning partner (Luckin et al., 2016).

Developing  an  understanding  of  AI  concepts  in  school  can  provide  learners  with opportunities to develop a sense of capability through the maturation of their problemsolving  skills  (Kong  et  al.,  2023;  Korte  et  al.,  2024).  This  will  provide  learners  with  the psychological empowerment to consider the use of AI as a solution to future problems, and ensure confidence in their ability to do so (Korte et al., 2024). To truly contribute as active members of the society, one must be cognitively and inherently ready to harness AI to the benefit of themselves, their professions and the larger society.

As AI becomes all the more ubiquitous, its impact is increasingly felt across societies. One such group foreseen to be significantly influenced is the workforce, as AI progressively changes and replaces jobs and forces industries and their workers to adapt to new

situations.  While  AI  may  generate  more  jobs  than  it  destroys  (World  Economic  Forum, 2020), we cannot expect most workers to migrate and smoothly adjust to one of those newly created roles. It is more likely, instead, that AI will augment existing roles, forming a worker-machine partnership (Dede et al., 2021). Once AI education is achieved, being AIliterate will imply that the citizens and workforce of the future can use AI in a societally beneficial way, ultimately, shaping the direction in which societies will develop in the AI era. The partnership between workers and AI is only possible when the workers properly and confidently use AI for problem-solving. Without sufficient empowerment, the workforce, regardless of the AI concepts and skills they possess, will not have the intention to apply AI in their lives. Only when the workforce believes in their ability to solve real-life problems  with  AI  and  identifies  themselves  as  such  will  they  be  ready  to  take  full advantage of AI.

## Ethical issues around AI

One must remember that the application of AI to solve real-life problems can - as with all technological  advances  -  lead  to  both  positive  and  adverse  impacts.  Balancing  these effects when using AI is an obligation of AI-literate educated learners, who must consider the  ethical  implications  when  solving  problems  with  AI.  The  justification  for  this  is twofold:  (1)  ensuring  the  AI-related  solutions  offer  net  benefit  and  contribution  to  the society, and (2) ensuring the broader usage of AI is sustainable and consistent with the SDGs (Vinuesa et al., 2020). Hence, ethical guidelines regarding AI systems development and  function  should  align  with  the  societal  values  (Nguyen  et  al.,  2023).  Furthermore, transparency  in  data  usage  and  its  responsible  monitoring  is  pivotal  (European Parliament, 2021; UNESCO, 2021) without forgetting privacy and safety also in AI assisted learning  (Nguyen  et  al.,  2023).  While  AI  literacy  education  can  introduce  basic  ethical principles, learners themselves have to develop their ethical awareness and reasoning via the considered deliberation of ethical issues concerning their AI-related projects.

Ultimately, when applying AI as solutions to real-life problems, the future workforce must  balance  the  benefits  and  disadvantages  the  solutions  inflict  on  the  society,  and make sure that these effects do not discriminate unduly. This is especially relevant for the popular promotion of AI literacy and our belief that all AI-literate educated citizens should participate in the AI society. Understanding how AI can be ethically utilised enables them to critically evaluate and analyse the development of AI, and to collectively shape societal response in the AI era.

## Possibilities of AI education and AI literacy

To conclude, we argue that AI in education can offer significant improvements in both face-to-face  and online learning environments, by engaging learners at their individual levels,  and  providing  timely  feedback  and  assessments  to  guide  learning  (Luckin  et  al., 2016).  Furthermore,  AI  in  education  can  reduce  gaps  and  challenges  in  education,  and lessen urban and rural learning differences. Specifically, we see AI offering and promoting the  possibilities  of  language  and  culture  revitalisation,  and  tackling  global  educational challenges.  AI  in  education  and  AI  literacy  can  be  used  to  help  realise  some  of  the sustainable  development  goals,  enhance  lifelong  learning,  and  advance  equality  and

inclusion  on  a  global  scale.  This  will  provide  a  pivotal  contribution  to  essential  global digital  cooperation  (United  Nations,  2020),  and  will  afford  our  species  the  skills  and outlook necessary to rise to the challenges that we will undoubtedly face moving forward.
