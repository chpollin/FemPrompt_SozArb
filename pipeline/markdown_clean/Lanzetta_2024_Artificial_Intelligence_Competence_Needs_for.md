## 2. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY

The research methodology employed in this study was designed to gather and analyse data on the competence needs of youth workers in the era of AI to ultimately inform the development of an AI Competence Framework for Youth Workers .

## 2.1 Research Questions

This study proposes three main research questions ( RQs ):

- RQ1 How is AI transforming the way young people live, participate and learn?
- RQ2 What challenges and opportunities do youth work professionals face when integrating AI into their practice?
- RQ3 What competencies are essential for integrating AI into youth work?

RQ1 seeks  to  explore  the  multifaceted  impact  of  AI  on  young  people's  lives,  focusing  on  their daily activities, social participation and educational experiences. It aims to understand the extent to which AI influences their behaviour, interactions, and overall well-being.

RQ2 addresses  the  practical  implications  of  AI  integration  in  youth  work.  It  investigates  the potential  benefits  and  new  possibilities  that  AI  can  bring  to  the  field,  as  well  as  specific difficulties that youth work professionals encounter.

RQ3 aims  to  identify the key knowledge, attitudes, and skills youth workers need to effectively incorporate AI into their practice.

## 2.2 Research Methods

The research was conducted through a systematic review, focus groups, and interviews.

## 2.2.1 Systematic Review

The  first  component  of  the  research  methodology  involved  a  systematic review  of  existing competence frameworks and relevant literature. A search strategy was designed by expanding the  research questions (RQs) and identifying relevant keywords and search strings. Synonyms

<!-- image -->

and alternative spellings were also considered to maximise the retrieval of relevant publications and articles.

The research team focused on two main terms of interest in performing database searches: 'AI competencies' and 'artificial intelligence in youth work'. Synonyms and related terms were used to  ensure  a  broad search. For instance, 'AI competence frameworks' included terms like 'digital competencies, 'AI skills, and 'AI competency models'. For 'AI in youth work', we included terms like ' AI  in  non-formal education', 'AI in education' and 'AI and youth'. The Boolean operators OR and AND were used to incorporate synonyms and connect keywords, forming the final search string.

The  search  was  conducted  on  multiple databases and platforms, including the United Nations Educational,  Scientific  and  Cultural  Organization  (UNESCO)  Digital  Library ,  the Organisation  for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) iLibrary ,  the Council  of  Europe 's  online resource databases, the EU Science Hub of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre, the Social Science Research Network (SSRN) and Springer ,  as well as the Erasmus+ Projects Results Platform to identify  relevant  research  results  of  complementary European projects. These databases were chosen for their comprehensive selection of relevant and recent articles. The search targeted titles, abstracts, and keywords, focusing on articles published from 2019 onwards to capture the most current advancements in the field.

One hundred forty-five articles were retrieved. Further refinement was conducted based on the relevance of the title,  abstract  and  keywords  to  the  research  questions.  A  total  of 48 sources were included in the research after data extraction.

The  collected  documents  were systematically reviewed to extract relevant information on AI competencies  and  their  integration  into  youth  work.  The  analysis  focused  on  identifying commonalities, intersections, and gaps within existing frameworks and literature. Insights were categorised  and  synthesised  to  provide  a  holistic  understanding  of  the  current  state  of knowledge on AI's impact on youth and youth work.

## 2.2.2 Focus Groups

The second research component involved conducting focus groups with  youth  work professionals to  gather  qualitative  data  on their needs, challenges, and perspectives regarding AI integration into their work.

<!-- image -->

Each  partner  organisation identified  and  recruited 10  youth  work  professionals from  their respective countries, ensuring diverse experiences and backgrounds in youth work and digital youth work.

Focus  group  sessions  were  structured  to  facilitate  open  and  in-depth  discussions  on  AI competencies, current practices, and the potential impact of AI on youth work. Discussions were guided by a set of predetermined questions designed to elicit detailed responses and insights from participants.

Results  from  the  sessions  were  reported  using  a  common  reporting  template  to  ensure  a consistent  capture  of  participants'  contributions.  Thematic  analysis  was  then  employed  to identify  key  themes and patterns in the data. Insights from the focus groups were integrated with  findings  from  the  systematic  review  to  provide  a  comprehensive  understanding  of  AI competency needs for youth work professionals.

## 2.2.3 Interviews

The third component consisted of interviews with three experts in AI ,  youth work, and digital education to gain additional insights and validate findings from the systematic review and focus groups.

Experts were selected based on their experience and expertise in AI, digital competencies and youth  work.  Semi-structured  interviews  were  conducted,  allowing  for  flexibility  in  exploring topics  of  interest  while  ensuring  consistency  across  interviews.  Questions  focused  on  AI competency requirements, best practices for integrating AI into non-formal education, and the future direction of AI in non-formal learning environments.

Interviews  were  transcribed, and content analysis was performed to extract relevant insights and  corroborate  findings  from  the  other  research  components.  The  results  contributed  to formulating recommendations for developing an AI Competence Framework for Youth Workers .

## 2.3 Limitations

This study presents potential limitations:

<!-- image -->

- The systematic review was limited to articles published from 2019 onwards, potentially excluding relevant earlier works that could have provided additional insights.
- The  focus  groups  were  only  conducted  in  partner  countries,  which  may  not  fully represent the global diversity of youth work practices and challenges.
- While  the number of participants in the focus groups and interviews is sufficient for qualitative analysis, it does not capture the full spectrum  of  experiences  and perspectives within the field of youth work.
- While comprehensive, the reliance on selected databases and platforms may still miss some relevant sources of information, especially those not indexed in these databases.
- AI  is  a  rapidly  evolving  field,  and  the  findings  from  this  research may quickly become outdated as new technologies and applications emerge.

Further  research  with  a  broader  scope,  larger  sample  sizes  and  continuous  updates  are necessary to keep the competence needs analysis relevant and comprehensive.

## 3.1 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

Authors : ABBRUZZESE Gianluca, LANZETTA Miriam

To fully grasp the impact of artificial intelligence on young people and youth work, it is essential first to understand what AI is, what it is not and how it functions. The definition provided by the High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence (AI HLEG) 2 -  the independent expert group set up by the European Commission in June 2018 -  can help us achieve this understanding:

<!-- image -->

Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are software (and possibly also hardware) systems designed by  humans that, given a complex goal, act in the physical or digital dimension by perceiving their environment through data acquisition, interpreting the collected structured or unstructured data, reasoning on the knowledge, or processing the information, derived from this  data  and  deciding  the  best  action(s)  to  take  to  achieve  the  given  goal.  AI  systems  can either use symbolic rules or learn a numeric model, and they can also adapt their behaviour by analysing how the environment is affected by their previous actions.

As  a  scientific  discipline,  AI  includes  several  approaches  and  techniques,  such  as  machine learning  (of  which  deep  learning  and reinforcement learning are specific examples), machine reasoning  (which  includes  planning,  scheduling,  knowledge  representation  and  reasoning, search,  and  optimisation),  and  robotics  (which  includes  control,  perception,  sensors  and actuators, as well as the integration of all other techniques into cyber-physical systems).

The Expert Group, expanding the definition of AI in the Commission Communication on AI 3 , has clarified  aspects  of  AI  as  a  scientific  discipline  and technology. It depicts AI systems as rational systems because  they  can  choose  the best action to pursue an objective based on the available resources.

## How do AI systems work?

AI  systems  perceive their environment through data acquisition, interpret the collected data, reason based on this information, and then decide on the best course of action to achieve the given  goal.  The  following  figure  provides  a  schematic  representation  of  an  AI  system's functioning.

Figure 1. Schematic representation of the functioning mechanisms of an AI system

<!-- image -->

As indicated in the AI HLEG's definition of AI, the functioning mechanisms of an AI system can be understood  through three key phases: perception , reasoning  and  decision-making ,  and actuation .

In  the perception phase,  data  input  systems  -  or sensors  collect  information  from  the environment, which can be either physical or digital. Whether structured or unstructured, this data is gathered and processed to become usable information for the AI system.

3 European  Commission  (2018). Communication  from  the  Commission  to  the  European  Parliament,  the European Council, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on Artificial Intelligence for Europe . Brussels, COM(2018) 237 final.

<!-- image -->

During the reasoning and decision-making phase , the system transforms the collected data into an  understandable  format  and  represents  it  to  produce  a  numerical  model. It  then  uses  this model to interpret the information and decide on the best action to achieve its goals.

Finally,  in  the actuation phase, the system implements the chosen action based on its decision. This  action  can  possibly  modify  the  environment,  feeding  new  data  back  into  the  perception phase.

Machine reasoning and machine learning are the key techniques upon which the decision-making processes of AI systems rely:

- Machine reasoning includes planning, scheduling, knowledge representation, and optimisation techniques. These techniques allow AI systems to solve complex problems by logically  processing  and  reasoning  through  data,  essential  for  tasks  requiring  strategic thinking and decision-making.
- Machine learning is a subset of AI that focuses on algorithms that enable systems to learn from and make predictions based on data.

## How do AI systems learn?

The most widely used approaches to machine learning are reinforcement learning, unsupervised learning, and supervised learning. Each of these learning paradigms has distinct mechanisms and applications.

In reinforcement learning ,  the system is free to make decisions over time and receives feedback as rewards or penalties to indicate whether its actions were effective. The system learns to make better decisions by maximising the cumulative rewards for its actions.

<!-- image -->

## Example: Online Recommendation Systems

Online  recommendation  systems  suggest  products  or  content  to users  based  on  their  previous  interactions.  The  system  learns through  feedback  (the  "reward")  from  the  user's  actions,  such  as clicking on a link or purchasing a suggested product.

<!-- image -->

In unsupervised learning , the model works with a dataset that does not include labelled outputs. The primary objective is to uncover hidden patterns or structures within the data.

## Example:  Marketing Customer Segmentation

Without predefined labels for how customers should be categorised, the system can identify groups of customers with similar behaviours or  characteristics.  These  segments  can then be used to personalise marketing campaigns.

<!-- image -->

In supervised learning ,  the  model is trained on a dataset that includes both input data and the corresponding desired outputs. The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs that allows the model to make accurate predictions on new, similar data.

## Example:  Email Spam Recognition

The system is trained with a series of emails labelled as "spam" or "not  spam."  The  model  learns  to  classify  new  emails  into  these categories based on their content and other attributes.

<!-- image -->

Some machine learning approaches use algorithms based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), which  are  inspired  by  the  neural  networks  of  the  biological  brain.  These  networks  consist  of units  (artificial  neurons)  organised  in  layers  that  learn  the  relationships  between  input  and output  through  weighted  connections.  In  a  neural  network,  the  input  data  (e.g.,  an  image)  is processed to produce an output (e.g., identifying what the image is about). During the training phase, the network adjusts the weights of these connections to minimise the error between the expected output and its actual output based on the provided examples.

<!-- image -->

## Example:  Handwriting Recognition

An ANN can be trained to recognise handwritten digits (0-9). The input data consists of images of handwritten digits, each labelled with the corresponding digit. During the training phase, the ANN learns to associate the pixel patterns in the images with the correct digits.  After  training,  the  network  can  take  a  new  image  of  a handwritten digit and identify it.

<!-- image -->

Deep learning takes ANN's capabilities a step further. It is a branch of machine learning that uses deep ANN,  leveraging multi-layered neural networks  to analyse  various  levels  of characteristics  in  data.  Deep  learning  models  have  numerous  layers,  each  of  which  extracts higher-level features from the raw input data. This hierarchical structure allows deep learning models to handle very complex patterns and representations, making them particularly powerful for  tasks  such  as  image  and  speech  recognition,  natural  language  processing,  and  other applications involving large amounts of unstructured data. The depth of these networks enables them  to  learn  intricate  patterns  and  make  highly  accurate  predictions,  often  surpassing  the capabilities of traditional machine learning models.

## Example:  Image Recognition

A  deep  learning  model  can  be  trained  to  recognise  objects  in photographs.  The  input  data  consists  of  thousands  of  labelled images,  each containing various objects like cats, dogs, cars, etc. The model has multiple layers, each learning to detect increasingly complex features, starting from edges and textures to shapes and, ultimately,  entire  objects.  This  hierarchical  learning  enables  it  to identify and classify objects within new images, even if they are in different positions, scales or lighting conditions.

<!-- image -->

Generative AI (GenAI) is a prime example of deep learning in action .  GenAI uses deep neural networks to generate new content, such as text, images, music, and more, based on the data it has been trained on. Thanks to the democratisation of GenAI, these advanced technologies have become more accessible to the public, increasing awareness of AI's capabilities. GenAI models,

<!-- image -->

such as Open AI's Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) foundation models, illustrate some of the powerful applications of deep learning.

## Wrapping up

We've explored many concepts of AI, including its foundational principles and various learning paradigms.  It  is  not  in  the  scope  of  this  publication  to  cover  every  aspect  of  AI  in  exhaustive detail,  but  we  have  explored  key  areas  that  are  crucial  for  understanding  how  AI  systems function and their potential applications.

The following image provides a visual representation of the hierarchical relationship between various components of AI, illustrating how each layer builds upon the previous one to contribute to the overall functionality of AI systems:

## 3.2 Artificial Intelligence and Youth

## Authors : ABBRUZZESE Gianluca, LANZETTA Miriam

The  rapid  developments  in  AI  technology  and  the  rise  of  accessible  AI-powered  tools  are transforming  the  way  we  live,  work  and  learn.  Young  people  have  already  warmly  embraced these solutions: a survey conducted  by the United  Nations  Office  of  Information  and Communications Technology in 2022 4  with 254 youth (10   to 24 years old) from 36 countries shows that about 80% said they interact with AI multiple times a day .  They also expressed a high level  of  engagement with AI-related issues, with 93% interested in discussing AI use and regulation and 86% wanting to collaborate with AI in the future. However, while 86% expressed awareness of AI, only 24% indicated they understand how AI works .

More recently, Microsoft's 2024 Global Online Safety Survey 5 has highlighted that young adults are  the  most  active  users  and  experimenters (56%) of generative AI. The survey, conducted from  July  27  to  August  22,  2023,  included  16,795  respondents  across  17  countries,  with  a balanced  representation  of  teens  (ages  13-17),  young  adults  (18-24), Millennials (25-44), Generation X (45-59) and Boomers (60-64). Out of 39% of the overall respondents who had ever used generative AI, young adults represented the age group with the highest share of users (56% ),  followed  by  Millennials  (43%), teens  (38% ),  Gen  X  (30%)  and  Boomers  (19%).  The following  figure  presents  the  distribution  of  generative  AI  users  by  age  group,  categorised  as Users , Experimenters or Non-Users based on the frequency of use of generative AI.

<!-- image -->

## Definitions:

Users : Respondents who had used generative AI daily, several times a week, weekly or less than weekly in the three months before the survey.

Experimenters : Respondents who had used generative AI once, twice or not at all in the three months before the survey. Non-Users : Respondents who had never used generative by the time of the survey.

How do they use AI? Teens and young adults (together, Generation Z or Gen Z ) and Millennials are excited  about  using  Generative  AI  for  work  or  school  and  entertainment.  The  excitement  is particularly  pronounced  in  scenarios  where  AI  can  assist  in  practical,  everyday  tasks,  like translation, increasing efficiency at  work  (applicable  to  &gt;  18-year-olds  only),  answering questions and asking for information, assisting with homework and school projects, entertainment, and image or video generation. The following figure presents the most exciting AI applications for the different age groups identified in Microsoft's Global survey.

Figure 5. The Most Exciting AI ApplicationsI by Age Group

The study revealed gender and cultural differences in AI usage and perceptions among young adults.

Male young adults were more likely to use AI, with 63% of them reporting usage compared to 49%  of  female  young  adults.  Among teens, this difference was slightly less pronounced, with 40% of males using AI compared to 35% of females.

Data based on Microsoft's 2024 Global Online Safety Survey 5 .

Figure 6. Generative AI  use among Gen Z by gender

<!-- image -->

Although the study did not provide a detailed age breakdown, it found that male participants were  generally  more  excited  about  AI  applications,  scoring  3  points  higher  on  average  than female  participants.  This  difference  in  excitement  might  be  linked  to  the  varying  levels  of concern between genders about generative AI scenarios. Female respondents expressed higher levels  of  worry,  particularly  regarding sexual or online abuse (+7 points), creating relationships with AI (+7 points), and amplifying biases (+6 points).

Cultural differences also played a role in the responses toward generative AI. Participants from collectivist  countries  showed  more  positive  attitudes  towards  AI  compared  to  those  from

<!-- image -->

individualistic countries 6 .  For instance, 45% of respondents from collectivist countries (e.g., e.g., Spain,  Brazil,  Colombia,  India,  Mexico,  Singapore,  and  South  Korea)  had  used  generative  AI, compared to 34% from individualist countries (e.g., Australia, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, South Africa, United Kingdom, and USA).. Additionally, more individuals from collectivist  cultures  reported  using  AI  weekly  or  more  frequently  (36%  versus  32%) and expressed higher levels of excitement about AI applications (35%, which is 10 percentage points more than their individualist counterparts).

## 3.3 The Multi-Dimensional Impacts of AI

Author

MARAVELAKI Anastasia Sonia

The integration of AI into various facets of life, from education to social interactions, heralds a paradigm  shift  with  profound  implications  for  individuals  and  societies.  As  AI  permeates recommendation systems, social media algorithms, and educational platforms, its influence on decision-making processes, economic behaviours, and learning methodologies becomes increasingly evident. However, alongside its promises, AI presents challenges, such as fostering healthy socialisation and mitigating the risks of digital addiction among youth. Navigating this evolving  landscape  necessitates  a  new  set  of  skills  and  competencies,  encompassing  data literacy, critical thinking, and ethical considerations. Moreover,  emerging  job  categories underscore the demand for specialised AI expertise in diverse industries. In essence, the rise of AI underscores the imperative for individuals, societies, and regulatory frameworks to adapt and harness its potential while addressing its ethical, social and psychological implications.

## 3.3.1 AI's Impact on Education

AI  has  the  potential  to  significantly  benefit education by transforming traditional teaching and learning  practices,  enhancing  administrative  efficiency,  and  providing  personalised  learning experiences.  According to the European Commission's " Ethical  guidelines  on  the  use  of  artificial intelligence (AI) and data in teaching and learning for educators " 7 , AI can help educators understand and exploit AI's full potential while being aware of possible risks to engage positively, critically, and  ethically  with  these  systems.  However,  evidence-based  research  on  the  impact  of  AI  in education  is  still  limited,  so  it  is  important  to  maintain  a  critical  and  supervised  attitude. Sometimes, AI systems can be used in different ways to support teaching or facilitate learning. When we talk about the types of AI systems that are used for teaching, learning, assessment, and school administration, a common distinction is made between 'student-facing,' 'teacher-facing,' and 'system-facing' AI systems.

The Commission's guidelines provide four use cases, which are presented in the following table.

## Student Teaching

Using AI to teach learners ( student-facing )

Intelligent tutoring systems can provide individualised instruction and feedback, allowing  learners  to  follow  a  step-by-step sequence of tasks without requiring teacher intervention. Dialogue-based tutoring systems adapt to student engagement levels, maintaining motivation  and  focus. AI-based language learning applications, used in both formal and non-formal contexts, offer real-time feedback on pronunciation,  comprehension, and fluency, making language acquisition more accessible and engaging.

<!-- image -->

## Teacher Supporting

Using AI to support the teacher ( teacher-facing )

AI  systems  can  reduce  teachers'  workloads through summative writing assessments, where AI evaluates and grades written work by identifying features like word usage, grammar, and sentence structure. AI also monitors student forums, providing automatic feedback and highlighting learners who need help or  are  not  participating.  AI  teaching assistants answer common questions, broadening their  range  of  responses  over time.  Pedagogical  resource  recommendation engines suggest  specific  learning  activities based on each student's preferences, progress, and needs.

<!-- image -->

## Student Supporting

Using AI to support student learning ( student-facing )

Exploratory  learning  environments  provide multiple  representations  to  help  learners find  their  own  paths  to  achieving  learning goals.  Formative  writing  assessments  offer regular automated  feedback,  encouraging continuous improvement. AI-supported collaborative learning  uses  data  on  each learner's  work  style  and  performance  to form balanced groups, enhancing teamwork by monitoring and suggesting improvements in group dynamics.

<!-- image -->

## System Supporting

Using AI to support diagnostic or system-wide planning ( system-facing )

System-wide AI applications support diagnostic and system-wide planning. Educational data mining helps allocate resources  efficiently  by  analysing  student data to create class groupings, assign teachers  timetables,  and  identify  learners needing additional support. Learning analytics  measure  cognitive  skills  such  as vocabulary, listening, spatial reasoning, problem-solving,  and  memory  to  diagnose learning difficulties early. AI-based guidance services  help  learners  create  pathways  for future education  by  forming  competence profiles  based  on  their  previous  education and interests.

Table 1. AI in Education: Categories and Use Cases

<!-- image -->

These  use  cases  provide  some  insight  into  how  AI  systems  are  being  used  by  educators  and learners to support the teaching, learning, and assessment process. However, as addressed by the  panellists  in  the  'Education  Meets  AI'  session  during  the  World  Economic  Forum's  2024 Annual Meeting in Switzerland 8 , educators also face two significant challenges :

1. Understanding how AI works in order to share their knowledge with learners and prepare them for a labour market that may be completely different from what their parents have experienced.;
2. Instilling  strong  digital  discipline in  learners  as  they  adopt  AI  tools  helps  them  become conscious, critical, and responsible users of AI technology.

As  highlighted  by  the  founder  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  of  the  educational  non-profit Code.org, Hadi Partovi, young people do not see education as limited to the formal education system. They attend school but also use platforms like YouTube for learning, often challenging the  constraints  imposed  by  their  schools.  For  instance,  when  schools  prohibit  the  use  of ChatGPT, learners are likely to explore it out of curiosity. Therefore, it is crucial for educational systems  to  recognise  and  embrace  technological  advancements  rather  than  lag  behind,  as learners will inevitably access these technologies with or without the school system.

## 3.3.2 Impact on Educational Accessibility and Inclusion

The foundation of special education lies in adopting a tailored and individualised approach. As researched by Abbasi 9 AI's sophisticated capabilities can bring unprecedented  levels of customisation  to  the  educational  process.  By  leveraging adaptive  learning  technologies  and advanced  AI  algorithms ,  distinct  learning  paths  can  be  created  to  meet  the  diverse  needs  of children  in  special  education.  These  AI  systems  assess  and  understand  each  student's  unique learning style, pace, and comprehension level. For example, if a student's learning preference is visual, the AI can modify  and  present  information  visually,  enhancing  engagement  and understanding.

https://www.researchgate.net/publication/377590496\_Impact\_of\_AI\_on\_the\_inclusion\_of\_Learners\_with\_ Special\_needs\_Public\_Policy\_Perspective\_in\_Contemporary\_Scenario

<!-- image -->

AI  technologies also help overcome communication barriers that often impede the educational progress  of  learners  with  special  needs.  Advanced  AI  features  like  voice  recognition,  and text-to-speech technologies enable learners with speech or physical limitations to communicate more effectively. A study by the World Economic Forum 10 ,  conducted between 2007 and 2020, revealed  that technology-supported  personalised  learning  significantly  improves  learning outcomes. While technology hasn't fully matched the benefits of one-on-one tutoring, recent AI advancements can analyse large data sets, offering personalised learning content, experiences, and real-time feedback similar to a private tutor.

These  AI  algorithms can customise content, adjust the learning pace and difficulty, and adapt learning  styles  based  on  the  student's  performance,  behaviour,  and  preferences.  By  analysing data patterns, AI can predict learning challenges, identify gaps, and craft personalised learning journeys by examining learners' learning history, preferences, and performance. However, these new  tools  are  most  effective  when  teachers  rigorously  test  them,  personalise  support,  tailor culturally  relevant  teaching  materials,  and  provide  instant  translations  to  adapt  content  to learners' needs. The relevance of the materials and examples is crucial for creating an engaging, understandable, and applicable learning environment. AI tools, in collaboration with teachers, can connect examples and concepts to each student's interests, experiences, and backgrounds.

Furthermore, AI can present materials in various formats to meet different visual, auditory, and physical needs. Customisable interfaces and adaptive technologies are particularly beneficial for neurodiverse learners and those with different physical abilities. For instance, AI technology can caption classroom lessons for learners with hearing impairments, allowing them access to any classroom  without  relying  on  human  sign  language  assistants.  This  enhances  personalised communication between teachers and learners.

Digital learning, when designed with accessibility features like text-to-speech, closed captioning, alternative  text  descriptions,  and  customisable  display  settings,  can  support  learners  with diverse  access  needs  and  learning  preferences.  The  integration  of  accessible  digital  learning tools in classrooms also enables teachers to adopt more inclusive practices.

<!-- image -->

A  notable  example  of  this  inclusive  approach  is  the Accessible  Digital  Textbooks (ADT) initiative 11 ,  which  is  a  collaboration  among  UNICEF,  ministries  of  education,  organisations  for people  with  disabilities,  publishers,  and  technology  partners.  This  initiative  aims  to  create inclusive digital learning tools known as Accessible Digital Textbooks, which allow children with and without disabilities to learn together. Launched in 2014, the ADT initiative emerged from extensive consultations and workshops led by UNICEF, involving representatives from several countries.  These  consultations  led  to  the  development  of  guidelines  to  help  ministries  of education, publishers, technology and content developers, teachers, and implementers digitally adapt textbooks based on Universal Design for Learning (UDL) principles. UDL is an educational framework  that acknowledges  the diverse  learning  styles  of  all  children  and  promotes differentiated  teaching  techniques  to  ensure  accessibility.  The  ADT  is  a  digital  adaptation  of curriculum-based textbooks following UDL principles, providing educational content in various formats,  such as narration (text-to-speech), sign language videos, and interactive activities, to meet  all  learning  preferences  and  access  needs.  The  ultimate  goal  of  the  ADT  initiative  is  to foster inclusive education systems by developing tools that make inclusive teaching and learning more achievable in classrooms.

## 3.3.3. AI's Social and Psychological Impact

The  rapid  growth  of  AI  has  ushered  in  significant  changes  across  various  aspects  of  life, particularly  impacting  human  behaviour  and  well-being.  AI's  influence  on  how  people  think, behave, and interact with their environment is profound, bringing both incredible opportunities and  possible  challenges.  As  AI  systems  continue  to  improve  and  integrate  into  daily  life, understanding their effects is crucial for individuals and societies.

Research  by  Mishra  et  al. 12 shows  how  AI  can  influence  human  behaviour  in  various  ways, transforming our interactions and decisions in different fields.

The  table  summarises  the  diverse  influences  of  AI  across  various  fields,  highlighting  how  AI technologies shape behaviour, decisions and interactions in multiple aspects of daily life. Users of AI  systems  are  becoming  aware  of  these  influences.  According  to  Microsoft's  2024  Global Online  Safety  Survey  -  introduced  at  the  beginning  of  this  chapter  -out  of  more  than  16,700 participants in the study, a substantial 87% of respondents worry about at least one scenario of generative AI use. Specifically,  71% are very or somewhat worried about AI-generated scams, 69%  about  deep  fakes  and  sexual  or  online  abuse,  and  66%  about  AI  hallucinations.  Other concerns  include  data  privacy  (62%),  the  amplification  of  biases  (60%),  and  the  creation  of relationships with AI (56%).

## 3.3.4. The Demand for AI Competences in the Labour Market

AI  is  reshaping  workplaces  across  various  industries.  According  to  the  2023  Employment Outlook by the OECD 13 general digital skills and basic knowledge of AI are increasingly essential for  workers  to  effectively  utilise  AI  applications.  Analytical  and  soft  skills  are  becoming  more critical  for  several  reasons.  Firstly,  automating  simpler  tasks  often  leaves  workers  with  more complex tasks, necessitating higher analytical skills such as specialised knowledge and the ability to  comprehend  and  apply  new  ideas.  Secondly,  task  automation  often  leads  workers  to undertake tasks that require soft and interpersonal skills. Moreover, AI enhances  the importance of creativity and communication within companies and increases the need for highly educated workers, as AI applications are designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, requiring a similar level of digital proficiency as using a smartphone.

Conversely, AI development demands specialised knowledge and skills, intersecting computer programming,  database  management,  and statistics. Online job postings mentioning "artificial intelligence"  often  list  programming  languages  like  Python,  big  data  management,  and  data analysis  and  visualisation  skills.  Specific  knowledge  of  AI  models  (e.g.,  decision  trees,  deep learning, neural networks, random forests), AI tools (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch), and AI software (e.g.,  Java,  Gradle,  Galaxy  Cluster)  is  also  necessary.  Findings  from  OECD  surveys 14 involving firms  in  Austria,  Canada,  France, Germany, Ireland, the United Kingdom, and the United States that  are  adopting  AI  confirm  that  most  workers  developing  and  maintaining  AI  possess  these

specialised  skills,  while  other  skills  are  already  becoming  redundant.  For  instance,  among workers  and  employers  in  the  finance  and  manufacturing  sectors  in  the  targeted  OECD countries, about half of AI users report that AI has reduced the value of some of their skills (51% in  finance  and  45%  in  manufacturing).  These  proportions  are even higher among workers who noted that some of their tasks had been automated (56% in finance and 51% in manufacturing).

The emergence  of  new  job types  for  building,  training,  updating  and  maintaining  AI technologies is becoming increasingly evident. However, Wilson et al. 15 has already identified in 2017 three new categories of AI-driven business and technology jobs:

1. Trainers :  These  roles  involve teaching AI systems to perform tasks, typically requiring technical and data science skills. For example, chatbots need training to communicate with  humans  using  compassionate  and  sympathetic  language  and  to  understand humour and language subtleties, necessitating interpersonal skills for the trainer.
2. Explainers : These roles clarify the functioning of algorithms and the different outcomes generated, particularly for managers and non-technical professionals in firms implementing  AI  applications, as well as consumers and the general public. Although these roles may become less necessary as AI systems become more transparent, they are currently crucial for ensuring transparency.
3. Sustainers :  These  roles  involve  ensuring  that  AI  systems  work as intended, detecting biases,  fakes,  and  mistakes,  and  addressing  unintended  consequences promptly. They monitor algorithms' outcomes to ensure they continue to function correctly over time as  technology,  data,  and  the  environment  evolve.  These roles are already emerging in firms implementing AI.

In  the  EU,  the  latest  Eurostat  data 16 shows  that  8% of enterprises with 10 or more employees used AI technologies to conduct their business in 2023. The most used types of AI technology included  automating  workflows  or  assisting  in  decision-making  (AI-based  software  robotic process  automation;  3%),  performing  analysis  of  written  language  (text  mining;  2.9%),  and machine  learning  (e.g.,  deep  learning;  2.6%).  Other  AI  technologies  used  included  converting

spoken language into machine-readable format (speech recognition; 2.5%), identifying objects or persons  based  on  images  (image  recognition,  image  processing;  2.2%),  generating  written or spoken  language  (natural  language  generation;  2.1%),  and  enabling  physical  movement  of machines via autonomous decisions based on observation of surroundings (autonomous robots, self-driving vehicles, and autonomous drones; 0.9%).

The  highest  shares  of  enterprises  using  AI  technologies  were  in  Denmark  (15.2%),  Finland (15.1%),  and  Luxembourg  (14.4%), while the lowest shares were recorded in Romania (1.5%), Bulgaria (3.6%), and Poland and Hungary (both 3.7%).

Although currently only 8% of companies in the EU are using AI technology, it is expected that this percentage will increase, as will the demand for AI competencies among young people.

## 3.4 The Role of Youth Workers in the AI Revolution

Authors : MACHADO Jorge, MARQUES Salomé, SCHNEIDER Beatryz

Professionals working with youth play a fundamental role in bridging the knowledge gap about AI,  especially  considering  the  limited  understanding  of  this  technology  in  the  European  youth sector.  The  rapid  transition  to  online  and  digital  work  environments  has  revealed  a  growing digital  divide  in  the  European  youth  sector.  Some organisations can keep up with and adapt to digital transformation, while others face significant challenges related to basic connectivity and skill development 17 .  This divide highlights the need for targeted support and resources to ensure all youth workers can effectively integrate digital tools and AI into their practices.

Currently, AI can serve different objectives depending  on its  application.  Research  by Pawluczuk 17 has portrayed diverse youth workers' perspectives on AI. For some, AI is seen as a tool,  similar  to  a  "work  companion,"  where  professionals  can  train  the  technology  to  perform specific  tasks  and  achieve  determined  results,  such  as organising schedules, building websites, and  creating  graphics.  These  applications  can  greatly  enhance  efficiency  and  allow  youth workers to focus more on directly engaging young people. However, there was also a sense of discomfort  regarding  AI,  linked  to  fears  that  the  technology  might  take  over  educators'  roles over time, potentially dehumanising youth work. The concern is that reliance on AI could reduce the personal interaction and emotional connection crucial in youth work, leading to a more transactional  and  less  empathetic  approach. This  potential  shift  could  undermine  effective youth engagement's trust and relationship-building foundation.

Furthermore, youth workers expressed a sense of injustice accompanied by AI's unpredictability. They noted that professionals often lack control over the data  collected  by  different technologies, which can significantly influence young people's choices, beliefs, and self-development.  This  unpredictability  raises  ethical  concerns  about  privacy,  consent,  and manipulating young minds. Youth workers stressed the importance of maintaining transparency and ethical standards in using AI to protect young people's interests and rights.

Ethical and regulatory issues were identified as obstacles to adopting technology in educational practice  due  to  concerns  about  aligning  the  work  with  European  youth  work  values,  such  as inclusion,  social  cohesion,  participation,  youth  empowerment,  and  communication.  Ethical problems  were also mentioned, where AI applications impose different biases based on input data and how they were trained, necessitating that educational practice with the technology be attentive to legal issues and ethical risks related to learners' privacy. In light of the introduction of this new technology, it is crucial to be prepared for the impact of AI on daily life, highlighting the importance of a broader understanding of its social and cultural implications.

With  the rapid advancement of technologies and artificial intelligence, establishing guidelines for  their  use  in  education  has  become  crucial.  Towards  this  direction,  the 2015 Qingdao Declaration 18 emphasises  leveraging  emerging  technologies  to  enhance  educational  systems, access, quality, equity, and service delivery. Similarly, the Beijing Consensus on Artificial Intelligence and Education 19 offers recommendations for using AI to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 4 of the 2030 Education Agenda.

As youth workers, the Beijing  Consensus  on  Artificial  Intelligence  and  Education offers guidelines and  responsibilities  for  practice  alongside  artificial  intelligence  and  shows  how  it  can  be integrated into the educational context. It shows how it can be integrated into the educational context.  Initially,  it  was  stated  that  AI  could  help  personalise  learning  to  meet  each  student's individual  needs  within  formal,  informal,  and  non-formal  education  contexts.  One  example is integrated lifelong learning systems with the potential to be accessed at any time and by anyone, allowing for flexible  learning  pathways and other benefits for the student. The document also explores  using  AI  to  assess  student  learning  more  effectively  and  provide  better  feedback.  A good practice that follows this approach is the Brazilian platform Letrus , which uses AI to correct learners'  essays  more  quickly  with  precise  feedback  on  spelling  and  writing.  A  teacher  then reviews the text, and the essay is returned to the student within three days, which could take months. Additionally, teachers can add their comments or challenge the AI system's conclusions. This approach offers opportunities for targeted class support and ensures that teachers remain

the main facilitators of the educational journey, with AI acting only as a supplementary support tool 20 .

Increasing accessibility is also a common goal in educational practice, as stated in the document. AI  should  ensure  that quality education and learning opportunities are promoted regardless of learners' conditions. The declaration states that the development and use of AI should not widen the  digital  divide  or  have a biassed perspective against minority groups, highlighting the active role  of  youth  workers  in  maintaining  a  relationship  that  adheres  to  values  such  as  inclusion, respect for diversity, responsibility and quality. The World Economic Forum 21 , in the article " How AI  Can  Accelerate Holistic Student Development and Make Teaching More Rewarding, " recommends two practices for youth workers related to accessibility: digital literacy to mitigate the growing digital  exclusion  and  technology  co-creation,  where experts, along with educators can create a strong pedagogy that meets local needs and cultural contexts and overcomes existing biases and inequalities.  Finally,  youth  workers  can  use  AI  to  support  implementing  systems  to  automate lesson  planning,  assessment,  and  communication  with  parents.  Professionals  have  described managing administrative processes, projects, digital offices, and meeting spaces as transformative in reducing workload, allowing them to spend more time with young people and perform quality youth work.

Hasse et al. 22 discussed the growing importance of promoting AI literacy to empower everyone to  understand what it means to coexist with AI and to make the most of what it offers while being protected from undue influences on their agency or human dignity.

Given that youth workers' nature of work with young people is more open to experimentation and exploration of real-world problems, young people need to be guided to understand how AI, automation, and especially automated decision-making can influence their treatment in society.

In  other  words,  just  as  they  are  educated  in  mathematics,  all  young  people  must  understand whether  the  AI  they  interact  with  treats  them  fairly  and  ethically.  Additionally,  professionals

need  to  manage digital youth work while protecting young people from potential side effects such  as  privacy  violations,  teaching  the  balance  between  using  AI  for  effective  learning,  and ensuring  that  young  people  develop  critical  thinking  and  creativity.  This  learning,  however, presents  significant  challenges  and  risks,  such  as  the  need  for  more  effective  and  continuous support, strategic regulation or updated digital security monitoring, and clear guidelines. With each passing day, those involved in education need more training and knowledge.

Considering all the issues related to the educational practice of youth workers and the existing documents,  it  is  evident  that  the  role  of  educators  involves  responsibilities  related  to  young people, their work, and the technological changes taking place. As highlighted by Stefan, youth leaders and workers should be critical supporters of AI technologies, even with the low adoption of  these  technologies  in  the  sector  and  the  low  literacy  levels  of  those  involved.  Investing sufficient resources in building a culture that embraces technology while remaining critical of its use  is  important. For  professionals  to  foster  an  understanding  of  artificial  intelligence,  it  is essential  to  develop  specific  educational  programs  that  can  be  implemented  in  schools, community  centres,  and  online  platforms.  These  programs  should  include  workshops  and interactive courses that offer opportunities for young people and youth professionals to develop competencies  (knowledge, attitudes, skills, values) related to AI, addressing its benefits, risks, and ethical implications.

One  of  UNESCO's  recommendations  for  Member  States is to promote AI education, such as basic  literacy,  numeracy,  coding,  digital skills, media, and information literacy, as well as critical and creative thinking, teamwork, communication, socio-emotional aspects, and AI 23 . Additionally,  it  is  important  to  encourage  project-based  learning,  challenging  young  people  to apply AI to solve real-world problems. Using games and simulations can make learning about AI more  fun  and  engaging,  capturing  the  interest  of  young  people  playfully  and  educationally. Finally,  it  is  crucial  to  promote  critical  thinking  so  that  young  people  can  critically  evaluate information about AI and make informed decisions about its use. In this way, they will be better prepared to deal with emerging technologies consciously and responsibly.

Advocating for positive artificial intelligence policies and practices is also critical to ensuring this technology is used beneficially and responsibly toward  young  people. To achieve  this,

professionals must engage with policymakers to  ensure  that  AI-related  regulations  are appropriate  and  protect  the  rights  of  young  people.  This  engagement  can  include  active participation in debates, presenting research, and collaborating in the creation of guidelines that consider the specific needs of this age group. Young people can also be supported in mobilising through  bodies  and  representatives  of  international  organisations  to  debate  a  beneficial technology-related  agenda  for  youth  and  in  monitoring  and  evaluating  the  impact  of  any  AI strategy.

In  conclusion,  regarding  the  construction  and  sharing of knowledge in the field, youth workers can  create  networks  and  communities  to  maximise  the  impact  of  technology.  Among  the activities  that  can  be  implemented  are  the  organisation  of  conferences  and  workshops  on  AI, training  opportunities,  updates,  and  networking  among young professionals and AI experts to disseminate new ideas and approaches, promoting a deeper and more applicable understanding of emerging technologies and their application in youth work. According to the World Economic Forum,  ''by  building  capacity,  we  can  ensure  that  leaders  develop  the  expertise  to  serve  their communities and that all staff are equipped to use AI responsibly and effectively throughout the education system'' 20 . Also, collaboration with researchers, programmers, and other stakeholders is  essential  to  promoting  young  people's  positive  use  of  AI.  These  partnerships  result  in  the development of new tools and resources that specifically cater to the needs of young people.

## 3.5 AI for Youth Work: Use Cases

## Authors : ABBRUZZESE Gianluca, LANZETTA Miriam, MANGIULLO Angela

The  integration  of  AI  in  youth  work  presents  significant  opportunities.  This  chapter  explores practical  AI  use  cases  that  can  augment  youth  workers'  capabilities  and  support them in their activities.  Use cases were identified during the systematic review, focus groups, and interviews conducted by the consortium. Particularly, the consortium first identified AI applications used by young  people  and  educators  operating  in  different  fields  of  education  and  training  and  then analysed their potential adaptability and benefits in youth work.

The Competence  Model  for  Youth  Workers  to  Work  Internationally 24 , published  by  JUGEND  für Europa and SALTO Training &amp; Cooperation in the framework of the European  Training Strategy (ETS) in the field of youth, was used as a framework to scope the areas in which AI may benefit youth work. Hence, use cases were categorised based on the nine competence areas outlined in the Model:

- Facilitating learning
- Designing programmes
- Managing resources
- Collaborating in teams
- Communicating meaningfully

This approach aims to provide youth workers with insights into how they might integrate these technologies  into  their  daily  practices  and  augment  their  competencies  through  AI.  In  the following pages, we outline potential use cases, categorised by each competence from the ETS Competence Model.

## 4. AI COMPETENCE NEEDS FOR YOUTH WORKERS

The previous chapter has addressed the multifaceted relations between artificial intelligence and youth and youth work. Chapter  3 provided an in-depth exploration of AI, including the perceptions and perspectives of young  people and youth workers and its impacts on education, accessibility, inclusion,  and  the  social  and psychological  dimensions.  It  also  examined the evolving role of youth workers within the AI  revolution and practical use cases of AI in youth work, illustrating how these technologies can be integrated into the practices of youth professionals.

In  this  context,  Chapter  4  delves  into  the specific  AI  competence  needs.  It  begins  by reviewing  existing  competence  frameworks and research that can serve as a foundation for  developing  AI-related  skills,  followed  by insights  and  findings  from focus groups with youth  work  professionals, shedding light on their  experiences and challenges in adapting to AI. Ultimately, the chapter aims to provide insights  to  inform  the  development  of  an AI competence  framework  tailored  for  youth workers,  which  is  aimed  at  equipping  them with the  necessary  skills to thrive in  an increasingly AI-driven environment.

This section synthesises findings from over 30 relevant sources and presents in detail the most appropriate sources that can provide an overview of existing competence frameworks directly or indirectly related to AI competences .

Results of the analysis are presented following a progression:

- -Frameworks mainly addressing foundational AI  competences ,  presented in sections 4.1.1. 4.1.2 and 4.1.3 ;
- -Frameworks  addressing digital  and  AI  competences  of  educators ,  presented  in  sections from 4.1.3 to 4.1.6 .

## 4.1.1 The Digital Competence Framework for Citizens (DigComp 2.2)

The  European Digital  Competence  Framework  for  Citizens ( DigComp ) 25 has  served  as  a  pivotal reference in defining digital competence across Europe for over a decade. It  provides a common language to identify and describe the competences every individual needs to thrive in a digital economy and society.

In 2022, the framework underwent a significant update to version 2.2,  to take into account the knowledge,  skills  and  attitudes  needed  by  citizens  to  engage  confidently,  critically  and  safely with new and emerging digital technologies, including systems driven by AI.

DigComp  2.2  delineates  five  core  areas  of  competence:  Information  and  Data  Literacy; Communication and Collaboration; Digital Content Creation; Safety; and Problem Solving. The 2.2 update introduces new examples of knowledge, skills, and attitudes that pertain to AI.

The following table provides a summary of the competences specified within each competence area, highlighting those updated to include AI-related examples.

The following sections present the new examples of knowledge, skills and attitudes introduced under each relevant competence.

## 1. Information and data literacy

## 1.1 Browsing, searching and filtering data, information and digital content

To articulate information needs , to search  for data, information  and  content  in  digital environments,  to  access  them  and  to  navigate  between  them.  To  create  and  update  personal search strategies.

## Knowledge

- Aware  that  search  engines,  social  media  and  content  platforms  often  use  AI algorithms  to  generate  responses  that  are  adapted  to  the  individual  user  (e.g. users  continue  to  see  similar  results  or  content).  This  is  often  referred  to  as

## 1.1 Browsing, searching and filtering data, information and digital content

To articulate information needs , to search  for data, information  and  content  in  digital environments,  to  access  them  and  to  navigate  between  them.  To  create  and  update  personal search strategies.

'personalisation'.

- Aware  that  AI  algorithms  work  in  ways  that  are  usually  not  visible  or  easily understood by users. This is often referred to as 'black box' decision-making as it  may  be  impossible  to  trace  back  how  and  why  an  algorithm  makes  specific suggestions or predictions.
- Knows  how  to  formulate  search  queries  to  achieve  the  desired  output  when interacting with  conversational  agents  or  smart  speakers  (e.g.  Siri,  Alexa, Cortana,  Google Assistant), e.g.  recognising  that,  for  the  system  to  be  able  to respond as required, the query must be unambiguous and spoken clearly so that the system can respond.

## Skills

## Attitudes

- Weighs the benefits and disadvantages of using AI-driven search engines (e.g. while they might help users find the desired information, they may compromise privacy and personal data, or subject the user to commercial interests).

## 1.2 Evaluating data, information and digital content

To  analyse,  compare  and  critically  evaluate  the  credibility  and  reliability  of  sources  of  data, information and digital content. To analyse, interpret and critically evaluate the data, information and digital content.

## Knowledge

## Skills

- Knows that the term 'deep-fakes' refers to AI-generated images, videos or audio recordings  of  events  or  persons  that  did  not  really  happen  (e.g.  speeches  by politicians, celebrity faces on pornographic imagery). They may be impossible to distinguish from the real thing.
- Aware  that AI algorithms might not be  configured  to  provide  only  the information  that  the  user  wants;  they  might  also  embody  a  commercial  or political  message  (e.g.  to  encourage  users  to  stay  on  the  site,  to  watch  or  buy something  particular,  to  share  specific  opinions).  This  can  also  have  negative consequences (e.g. reproducing stereotypes, sharing misinformation).
- Aware that the data, on which AI depends, may include biases. If so, these biases can  become  automated  and  worsened  by  the  use  of  AI.  For  example,  search results about occupation may include stereotypes about male or female jobs (e.g. male bus drivers, female salesperson).
- Able to recognise that some AI algorithms may reinforce existing views in digital environments  by  creating  'echo  chambers'  or  'filter  bubbles'  (e.g.  if  a  social media stream favours a particular political ideology, additional recommendations can reinforce that ideology without exposing it to opposing arguments).

## 1.3 Managing data, information and digital content

To organise, store and retrieve data, information, and content in digital environments. To organise and process them in a structured environment.

## Knowledge

- Aware that sensors used in many digital technologies and applications (e.g. facial tracking  cameras,  virtual  assistants,  wearable  technologies,  mobile  phones, smart devices) generate large amounts of data, including personal data, that can be used to train an AI system.

## 2. Communication and collaboration

## 2.1 Interacting through digital technologies

To  interact  through  a  variety  of  digital  technologies  and  to  understand  appropriate  digital communication means for a given context.

## Skills

## Attitudes

- Knows how to identify signs that indicate whether one is communicating with a human or an AI-based conversational agent (e.g. when using text- or voice-based chatbots).
- Able to interact  and give feedback to the AI system (e.g. by giving user ratings, likes,  tags  to  online  content)  to  influence  what it next recommends (e.g. to get more recommendations on similar movies that the user previously liked).
- Open  to AI systems supporting  humans  to  make  informed  decisions  in accordance with their goals (e.g. users actively deciding whether to act upon a recommendation or not).

## 2.2 Sharing through digital technologies

To share data, information and digital content with others through appropriate digital technologies. To act as an intermediary, to know about referencing and attribution practices.

## Knowledge

- Aware  that  everything  that  one  shares  publicly  online  (e.g.  images,  videos, sounds)  can  be  used  to  train  AI  systems.  For  example,  commercial  software companies who develop AI facial recognition systems can use personal images shared  online  (e.g.  family  photographs)  to  train  and  improve  the  software's capability to automatically recognise those persons in other images, which might not be desirable (e.g. might be a breach of privacy).

<!-- image -->

## 2.3 Engaging in citizenship through digital technologies

To participate in society through  the  use  of  public  and  private  digital services.  To  seek opportunities for self-empowerment and for participatory citizenship through appropriate digital technologies.

## Knowledge

## Skills

## Attitudes

- Knows that a secure electronic identification, (e.g. identity cards which contain digital  certificates),  enables  citizens  to  increase  safety  when  using  online services provided by the government or by the private sector.
- Knows that all EU citizens have the right to not be subject to fully automated decision-making  (e.g.  if  an  automatic  system  refuses  a  credit  application,  the customer has the right to ask for the decision to be reviewed by a person).
- Recognises that while the application of AI systems in many domains is usually uncontroversial  (e.g.  AI  that  helps  avert  climate  change),  AI  that  directly interacts with  humans  and  takes  decisions  about  their  life  can  often  be controversial (e.g.  CV-sorting  software for recruitment procedures, scoring of exams that may determine access to education).
- Knows that AI per se is neither good nor bad. What determines whether the outcomes of an AI system are positive or negative for society are how the AI system is designed and used, by whom and for what purposes.
- Knows how to identify areas where AI can bring benefits to various aspects of everyday life. For example, in healthcare, AI might contribute to early diagnosis, while in agriculture, it might be used to detect pest infestations.
- Readiness to contemplate ethical questions related to AI systems (e.g. in which contexts, such as sentencing criminals, should AI recommendations not be used without human intervention)?

## 2.6 Managing digital identity

To create, and manage one or multiple digital identities, to be able to protect one's own reputation, to deal with the data that one produces through several digital tools, environments and services.

## Knowledge

- Aware  that  AI  systems  collect  and  process  multiple  types  of  user  data  (e.g. personal  data,  behavioural  data  and  contextual  data)  to  create  user  profiles which are then used, for example, to predict what the user might want to see or do next (e.g. offer advertisements, recommendations, services).

## Skills

## Attitudes

- Knows  how  to  modify  user  configurations  (e.g.  in  apps,  software,  digital platforms) to enable, prevent or moderate the AI system tracking, collecting or analysing data (e.g. not allowing the mobile phone to track the user's location).
- Identifies  both  the  positive  and  negative  implications  of  the  use  of  all  data (collection, encoding and processing), but especially personal data, by AI driven

digital technologies such as apps and online services.

## 3. Digital content creation

## 3.1 Developing content

To create and edit digital content in different formats, to express oneself through digital means.

## Knowledge

- Knows that AI systems can be used to automatically create digital content (e.g. texts,  news,  essays,  tweets,  music,  images)  using  existing  digital  content  as  its source. Such content may be difficult to distinguish from human creations.

## 3.2 Integrating and re-elaborating digital content

To  modify,  refine,  improve  and  integrate  information  and  content  into  an  existing  body  of knowledge to create new, original and relevant content and knowledge.

## Skills

- Knows how to incorporate AI edited/manipulated digital content in one's own work (e.g. incorporate AI generated melodies in one's own musical composition). This  use of AI can be controversial as it raises questions about the role of AI in artworks, and for example, who should be credited.

## 3.4 Programming

To plan and develop a sequence of understandable instructions for a computing system to solve a given problem or perform a specific task.

## Attitudes

- Considers  ethics  (including  but  not  limited  to  human  agency  and  oversight, transparency, non-discrimination, accessibility,  and  biases  and  fairness) as one of the core pillars when developing or deploying AI systems.

## 4. Safety

## 4.2 Protecting personal data and privacy

To protect personal data and privacy in digital environments. To understand how to use and share personally identifiable  information while being able to protect oneself and others from damages. To understand that digital services use a 'Privacy policy' to inform how personal data is used.

## Knowledge

- Knows that the processing of personal data is subject to local regulations such as the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (e.g. voice interactions with a virtual assistant are personal data in terms of the GDPR and can expose users to certain data protection, privacy and security risks).

## Attitudes

- Weights the benefits and risks before allowing third parties to process personal data (e.g. recognizes that a voice assistant on a smartphone, that is used to give commands  to  a  robot  vacuum  cleaner,  could  give  third  parties  -  companies, governments, cybercriminals - access to the data).

<!-- image -->

## 4.4 Protecting the environment

To be aware of the environmental impact of digital technologies and their use.

## Knowledge

- Aware  that  certain  activities  (e.g.  training  AI  and  producing  cryptocurrencies like  Bitcoin)  are  resource  intensive  processes  in  terms  of  data  and computing power. Therefore, energy consumption can be high which can also have a high environmental impact.

## Attitudes

- Considers the ethical consequences of AI systems throughout their life-cycle: they  include  both  the  environmental  impact  (environmental  consequences of the production of digital devices  and  services)  and  societal impact, e.g. platformization of work and algorithmic management that may repress workers' privacy  or  rights;  the  use  of  low-cost  labour  for  labelling  images  to  train  AI systems.

## 5. Problem solving

## 5.1 Solving technical problems

To identify technical problems when operating devices and using digital environments, and to solve them (from trouble-shooting to solving more complex problems).

## Knowledge

- Aware  that  AI  is  a  product  of  human  intelligence  and  decision-making  (i.e. humans choose, clean and encode the data, they design the algorithms, train the  models,  and  curate and apply human values to the outputs) and therefore does not exist independently of humans.

## 5.2 Identifying needs and technological responses

To  assess  needs  and  to  identify,  evaluate,  select  and  use  digital  tools and possible technological responses and to solve them. To adjust and customise digital environments to personal needs (e.g. accessibility).

## Knowledge

## Skills

- Able to identify some examples of AI systems: product recommenders (e.g. on online  shopping  sites),  voice  recognition  (e.g.  by  virtual  assistants),  image recognition (e.g.  for  detecting tumours in x-rays) and facial recognition (e.g. in surveillance systems).
- Aware  that  AI-driven  speech-based  technology  enables  the  use  of  spoken commands that can enhance the accessibility of digital tools and devices (e.g. for  those  with  mobility  or  visual  limitations,  limited  cognition,  language  or learning  difficulties),  however,  languages  spoken  by  smaller  populations  are often not available, or perform worse, due to commercial prioritisation.
- Knows  how  and  when  to  use  machine  translation  solutions  (e.g.  Google Translate, DeepL) and simultaneous interpretation apps (e.g. iTranslate) to get a  rough  understanding of a document or conversation. However, also knows that  when  the  content  requires  an  accurate  translation  (e.g.  in  healthcare, commerce or diplomacy), a more precise translation may be needed.

## 5.3 Creatively using digital technology

To use digital tools and technologies to create knowledge and to innovate processes and products. To  engage  individually  and  collectively  in  cognitive  processing  to  understand  and  resolve conceptual problems and problem situations in digital environments.

## Attitudes

- Open to engage in collaborative processes to co-design and co-create new products and services based on AI systems to support and enhance citizens' participation in society.

## 5.4 Identifying digital competence gaps

To understand where one's own digital competence needs to be improved or updated. To be able to support  others  with  their digital  competence  development.  To  seek  opportunities  for self-development and to keep up-to-date with the digital evolution.

## Knowledge

## Attitudes

- Aware that AI is a constantly-evolving field, whose development and impact is still very unclear.
- Has  a  disposition  to  keep  learning,  to  educate  oneself  and  stay  informed about AI   (e.g.  to  understand  how  AI algorithms work; to understand how automatic decision- making can be biased; to distinguish between realistic and  unrealistic  AI;  and  to understand  the  difference  between  Artificial Narrow  Intelligence,  i.e.  today's  AI  capable  of  narrow  tasks  such  as  game playing,  and  Artificial  General  Intelligence,  i.e.  AI  that  surpasses  human intelligence, which still remains science fiction).

## 4.1.2 Digital Promise's AI Literacy Framework

Digital  Promise,  a  global  nonprofit  working  to  expand  opportunity  for  each  learner,  has developed an AI Literacy Framework 26 presenting a comprehensive approach to engaging with AI through three interconnected Modes of Engagement :

1. Understanding  AI:  Acquiring  foundational  knowledge  about  AI  and  how  it  works  in order to make informed decisions about using and evaluating AI systems and tools. This mode involves a deep dive into the technical knowledge  underpinning  AI. It encompasses the use of data, creation of automations, and critical underlying skills such as  algorithmic  thinking,  pattern  recognition,  abstraction,  and  decomposition.  This foundational  understanding  is  crucial  for  AI  literacy  as  it  equips  users  with  the necessary knowledge to make informed decisions regarding the use and evaluation of AI,  especially  understanding  how AI leverages large datasets to develop associations and automate predictions.

26 Mills K., Ruiz P ., Lee K., Coenraad M., Fusco J., Roschelle J., Weisgrau J. (2024). AI Literacy: A Framework to Understand, Evaluate, and Use Emerging Technology . Digital Promise. DOI: <!-- image -->

2. Evaluating AI: Centering human judgment and justice to critically consider the benefits and/or costs of AI to individuals, society, and the environment. This mode encourages users to evaluate AI tools from four key perspectives: transparency, safety, ethics, and impact. These components prompt users to question the data and methods used in AI systems, the security and privacy of data, the societal biases reproduced by datasets, and the credibility and biases of AI outputs. This evaluation is pivotal in ensuring that AI usage is not only technically proficient but also ethically sound and socially responsible.
3. Using AI: Interacting, creating, and problem-solving with AI as a progression of use for distinct contexts and purposes. This mode  is structured around  three  distinct interactions  defined  in  the  research-based  4  As  framework 27 ,  which  focuses  on  how families engage with AI, such as Interact, Create and Apply :
3. -Interacting with  AI  involves  engaging  with  systems that collect data to provide automated decisions, connections, and suggestions;
4. -Creating with AI involves leveraging AI systems to develop synthetic content;
5. -Applying AI entails developing AI systems to process and predict information.

## 4.1.3 UNESCO's Mapping of Government-endorsed AI Curricula

A  mapping of government-endorsed K-12 AI curricula at the international level developed by UNESCO 28   provides  a  comprehensive  overview  of  AI  curriculum  areas,  useful  for  informing educators and curriculum developers about integrating AI into educational settings. While it is not  a  proper  framework,  it  offers  a  clear  depiction  of  competences  and  areas  crucial  for understanding and implementing AI in education.

The  mapping  relevaled  AI  curriculum  content  is  structured  into  three  main  categories:  AI foundations,  ethics  and  social  impact,  and  understanding,  using,  and  developing  AI.  Each category encompasses specific topic areas that reflect key competencies required for engaging with AI:

UNESDOC Digital Library. https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000380602.locale=en

<!-- image -->

1. AI  Foundations:  This  category  includes  fundamental technical skills necessary for AI engagement  such  as  algorithms  and  programming,  data  literacy,  and  contextual problem-solving. These areas form the technical backbone of AI education, emphasising the  skills  needed  to  manipulate  and  understand  data  and  the  basic  programming required to interact with AI systems.
2. Ethics  and  Social  Impact: It covers the ethical considerations and societal implications of  AI.  This  includes  understanding  the  ethical  challenges  associated  with  AI,  such  as transparency, auditability,  fairness,  and  the  broader social impacts like changes to the workforce and legal frameworks. This category aims to prepare students to navigate the complex ethical landscape of AI and its effects on society.
3. Understanding,  Using,  and  Developing  AI:  This  category  includes  more  advanced competencies involving the direct interaction with AI technologies and techniques, and the  development of new AI technologies. It includes learning how AI processes work (e.g.,  machine  learning models and neural networks), using AI technologies in practical applications,  and  developing  new AI solutions to address social challenges or provide new services.

Teachers, youth workers and educators shall support youth to develop personal empowerment and reflection,  critical  thinking  and  ethics,  and  design  thinking  skills  to  engage in creative and responsible AI projects and initiatives.

## 4.1.4 European Framework for the Digital Competence of Educators (DigCompEdu)

The European Framework for the Digital Competence of Educators (DigCompEdu), developed by the Joint Research Centre of the European  Commission 29 , captures and describes educator-specific digital competences. It proposes 22 elementary competences organised in 6 areas, each focusing on different aspects of educators' professional activities:

1. Professional Engagement - Using digital technologies for communication, collaboration and professional development.
2. Digital Resources - Sourcing, creating and sharing digital resources.

## 4.2  Experiences  from  the  Field:  Focus  Groups  with  Youth  Work Professionals

Authors :

ACOMI Nicoleta, ACOMI Ovidiu

Contributors : LANZETTA  Miriam,  MACHADO  Jorge,  MANGIULLO  Angela,  MARAVELAKI  Anastasia Sonia, MARQUES Salomé

According  to  Krueger  and  Casey  (2014) 34 ,  a  focus  group  is  a  suitable  method  to  collect qualitative  data,  exploring  people's  opinions,  attitudes,  and  experiences  on  a  specific  topic  or issue. They  define  focus  groups  as  "a  carefully  planned  discussion  designed  to  obtain perceptions  on  a  defined  area  of  interest  in  a  permissive,  non-threatening  environment". Therefore, a focus group was chosen to collect qualitative data from youth work professionals across  four  countries:  Italy,  Portugal,  Romania,  and  Greece.  They  define  focus  groups  as  "a carefully  planned discussion designed to obtain perceptions on a defined area of interest in a permissive,  non-threatening  environment".  Therefore,  a  focus  group  was  chosen  to  collect qualitative  data  from  youth  work  professionals  across four countries: Italy, Portugal, Romania, and Greece.

## 4.2.1 Focus Group Objectives

The main objective of the focus group was to gather youth work professionals' needs, challenges, and jobs to be done for integrating AI into their work to ultimately support the identification of their competence needs to harness the potential of AI in their work.

## 4.2.2 Focus Group Process

The focus groups followed a semi-structured format based on a common guideline developed by the  project  consortium.  The  guideline  included  instructions  for  facilitators,  brainstorming suggestions,  discussion  questions  on  the  topics  below,  and  reporting  templates  ensuring  the consistency and quality of data collection across different countries and contexts. The guideline also  provided  ethical considerations and practical tips for conducting online focus groups, such as  choosing  an  appropriate platform, inviting and engaging participants, and managing digital collaboration tools.

- The definition and understanding of AI;
- The current and potential use of AI in youth work activities;
- The benefits and risks of AI for youth work and young people;
- The skills and competencies needed to use AI in youth work;
- The preferred modes and formats of AI training and support;

## 4.2.3 Composition of the Group

The focus groups comprised 72 youth work professionals representing different types and levels of experience, fields of action, and target groups. The recruitment process was oriented towards achieving diverse participant groups in terms of age, educational, cultural, and socioeconomic backgrounds, gender identities, and orientations. Furthermore, the group included both digitally included  and  AI-enthusiastic  youth  workers  and those with limited digital competencies who may feel alienated and excluded from the topic.

The focus groups were conducted online, through video-conferencing platforms, and face-to-face between 20 April and 23 May 2024 and lasted about 90 minutes.

Each  partner  summarised  and  analysed  the  results  from  each  focus  group,  using  a  common template to report the main findings and conclusions.

## Activity Summary

A group of 7 participants contributed to the online focus group session on 13th May 2024. This  session  aimed  to  share  knowledge and insights on possible applications of AI in youth work-related professions based on youth workers' needs and challenges. Furthermore, the session addressed the importance of developing and strengthening AI and digital skills that are fundamental to efficiently directing the AI potential into youth work.

After  a  brief  introduction  of  the  participants,  an  overview  of  the  main  objectives  of  the session  and  a  presentation  of  AI  fundamentals  and  use  cases  by  the  session's  facilitator, participants discussed the main challenges and concerns about AI practice within their jobs. Through  brainstorming  and  collaborative  activities  on  a  virtual  whiteboard,  the  group outlined the potential benefits of integrating AI into their training planning and activities, such  as  a  more  accurate  analysis  of  youth  needs  and  program  outcomes  that  can  lead  to better engagement during training sessions.

## Key Outcomes:

The  following  paragraphs  present  the main outcomes for each key question (Q) the focus group facilitator posed to the participants.

## Q1: Do you know (other) relevant AI applications for youth work?

Participants indicated the following tools as most relevant in use:

- Microsoft  Translator :  AI  can  automatically  detect  the  language  of  the  speaker, considering  the broader context of sentences and paragraphs. This helps provide translations  that  make  sense  in  context  rather  than  translating  word-for-word. Real-time  translation  ensures  that  language  barriers  do  not  hinder  participation, promoting cultural exchanges and fostering an inclusive environment.
- Padlet : it  is  a  tool  for  collaboration  and  information  sharing.  AI  can  analyse  the content added to a Padlet and automatically tag or categorise it. It makes it easier to organise and search for information within a board. Interactive and well-organised content  can  increase  engagement  among  young  people,  making  sessions  more dynamic and engaging.

- Synthesia :  This  application  uses  AI  to  create  realistic  video  content  featuring AI-generated avatars, making  educational  content  or  training  material  more interesting so that young people can actively engage with the content.
- Kahoot! :  AI  algorithms  analyse  user  performance  and  behaviour  to  tailor quizzes and games to individual learning needs, providing a more personalised experience.
- Mentimeter :  AI  improves  the  creation  of  interactive  and  dynamic  presentations that  capture  the  attention  of  young  people,  encouraging  active  participation;  it facilitates  the  inclusion  of  open-ended  questions  and  real-time  analysis,  giving  all participants a voice and ensuring their feedback is heard and considered.
- DeepAI: a text, image and video generator. It can help create content, create images from scratch, or edit existing images with AI.

## Q2: What positive outcomes/benefits do you see in the case studies provided?

- Engagement :  AI's  capabilities  to  analyse  learners'  performance  and  behaviour  to suggest quizzes, games, or activities suitable to their learning needs can help design and deliver a more personalised experience.  Presenting content learners perceive as fitting for their learning levels,  and  concerns  can  make  the  educational experience more enjoyable and engaging.
- Language and accessibility :  Some  of  the  applications  (e.g.,  HandTalk  or Microsoft Translators,  ChatGPT)  can  allow  youth  work  professionals  to  create  content  in multiple languages and leverage other communication modalities (e.g., visual-manual  modality,  like  HandTalk).  Hence,  these  applications  can  help  break down  communication  barriers,  supporting  communication  between  people  from different backgrounds and enhancing inclusivity.
- Time  optimisation  and  content  creation :  AI-powered  content  generation  and recommendations  save  time for youth work professionals, encouraging creativity and allowing them to focus on interaction and mentorship.

## Q3: What challenges do you see in using AI solutions in your work?

- Data  and  privacy :  AI  systems  often  require  access  to  personal  data  to  function effectively. This raises concerns about how data is collected, stored, and used.
- Uncertainty avoidance :  Some  youth  work  professionals  may hesitate to adopt AI technology due to a lack of familiarity or understanding about how it works and its potential impact on their work.

<!-- image -->

- Skills  requirement :  Youth  work  professionals  may  lack  the  necessary  skills  to effectively use and manage AI tools.

## Q4: What skills do you think are essential for youth workers to effectively use AI tools?

Participants  pointed  to  the  need  for all  the  competencies  outlined  in  the  European LifeComp 35 and DigComp 36   Frameworks as the must-have foundational set of knowledge, attitudes and skills, prerequisites for effective use of AI. Particularly  among  the competencies mentioned during the focus group:

- Learning  to  learn :  recognising  one's  own  knowledge  gap  about  AI  and  pursuing continuous professional development opportunities to bridge it;
- Critical  thinking : it  is  essential  to  critically  evaluate  AI-generated  content,  data, and  recommendations  for  ensuring  that  youth workers make informed decisions and avoid potential biases.
- Flexibility :  youth  workers  should  demonstrate  adaptation  and  resilience  to  face new technological challenges.
- Data literacy : ability to read, understand, create and communicate data.
- Digital  literacy :  proficiency  in  using  digital  tools  and  platforms  is  essential  for navigating AI tools effectively.
- AI literacy : familiarity with AI concepts, terminology, and applications is crucial for understanding  how  AI  tools  work  and  their  potential  impact  on  youth  work practices.

A  practical  example  of  integrated  LifeComp-  and  DigComp-based  training  for  youth workers was presented by one of  the  participants,  representative  of  a  non-profit organisation based in Caserta, Associazione Arcipelago APS .  Particularly, the organisation is leading a complementary project (' AI  SKills  4  Youth  Workers' ,  a  small-scale  partnership in youth co-funded by the Erasmus+ Programme under Grant Agreement Number 2023-3-IT03-KA210-YOU-000176076)  that will implement a training program for youth workers  on  AI,  based  on  LifeComp  and  DigComp  frameworks.

## Participants' Feedback

<!-- image -->

I would recommend the activities of this project as they can help bring out the creativity of young people and distract them from the problems of everyday life by providing support in dealing with emotional and psychological difficulties.

<!-- image -->

I believe that the contents of the project are very interesting and useful for youth workers.

<!-- image -->

AI to support Youth Workers is an unmissable opportunity.

<!-- image -->

I believe it is very important to support people (learners and non-learners) towards this change so that they can acquire or improve the understanding and awareness useful in their working and daily life, especially in a fragile context such as the educational one.

<!-- image -->

I find the possibility of reaching as many young people as possible through a part of their "language" and being able to provide them with the basis to use it at its best is exciting.

<!-- image -->

This is the future of education.

## Activity Summary

The activity was organised at Constanta Maritime University and gathered 40 participants from 8 organisations. The focus group started with an icebreaker to make the people relax and  connect  with  each  other.  After  the  brief  introduction  of  the  project  and  of  the participants,  the  facilitator  invited  them  to  a  brainstorming  session.  She  launched  the scenario question, 'If you could automate one part of your daily routine with AI, what would it be and why?". Participants demonstrated various levels of AI knowledge. They suggested a few  AI  tools  that  they  are  already  using.  They  mentioned  that  they  would  like  to  use  AI mainly to create educational content and learning materials and for administrative tasks like scheduling lesson planning.

Then, the facilitator and project manager from T4E, Dr. Nicoleta Acomi, presented the scope of the project. The Focus group continued with the 5 questions which were addressed by the facilitator  and  the  responses  were  collected on small post-its and advertised on a flipchart paper.  The  activity  continued  with  discussions  about  AI  tools  and  they  presented  the benefits  and  challenges.  In  the  continuation  of  the  discussions,  they  identified  the  skills needed and a set of activities that can lead to development of the competencies.

## Key Outcomes:

The following paragraphs present the main outcomes for each key question (Q) posed by the focus group facilitator to the participants.

This  includes  understanding  and  respecting  the  ethical  implications of AI, such as privacy concerns and bias, to ensure that these tools are used in ways that protect and respect young people's rights. Additionally, youth workers need to develop prompt engineering skills to generate relevant and personalised content effectively. Adaptation and resilience in the face of technological challenges, coupled with a growth mindset towards innovation, are crucial for  integrating  AI  into  youth  work.  Facilitating  access  to  AI  tools  for  all  young  people  and organising  workshops  and  training  sessions  on  AI  usage  were also identified as critical  steps towards inclusive and effective AI integration in youth work practices.

To  support  youth  workers  in  acquiring  AI-related  competencies,  it  is  crucial  to  provide comprehensive training and resources that facilitate hands-on learning and continuous skill development. Participants  emphasised  the  importance of interactive workshops, hackathons, and  collaborative  projects  that  offer  practical  experience  with  AI  tools  in  a  supportive environment. These training sessions should be complemented by a collection of online courses, tutorials,  and  learning  materials  that youth workers can access at their own pace. Additionally, incorporating AI training into high school or university IT classes can equip young people with valuable skills early on, preparing them for future roles that increasingly demand AI literacy.

Participants also highlighted the need for knowledge exchange events, such as conferences, seminars,  and  meetups,  where  youth  workers  can  share  experiences,  best  practices,  and insights about AI. Networking  and  learning sessions with peers and experts foster a collaborative  environment  for  knowledge  exchange.  Furthermore,  creating  a  catalogue  or guidebook  of AI tools,  complete  with  short  descriptions,  instructional  videos,  and  user comments,  would  help users quickly identify the most suitable tools for their needs. Implementing self-assessment tools to measure AI competency and providing targeted feedback and  solutions  based  on  these  assessments  would  further  enhance  skill  development.  Lastly, introducing youth workers to project management  apps  and  training them  in  prompt

engineering can streamline their tasks and improve their ability to utilise AI effectively in their daily work.

The feedback received from participants highlighted a highly positive reception of the project activities,  emphasising  the  value  and  impact  of the sessions on their professional and personal development.  Participants  appreciated  the  creativity  and  emotional  support  the  activities provided,  which  helped  them  manage  everyday  challenges  and  emotional  difficulties.  They underscored the importance of fostering an understanding and awareness of AI, particularly in the educational context, which can be fragile and in need of innovative solutions.

Overall,  participants  expressed  motivation  and  enthusiasm  to  stay engaged with the project, looking  forward  to  future  events  and  the  continued  development of AI applications in youth work.  The  positive  feedback and lack of suggestions for improvement indicate a high level of satisfaction and a strong endorsement of the project's direction and impact.

## 5. CONCLUSIONS

## Authors : ACOMI Nicoleta, LANZETTA Miriam

This research has provided significant insights into the competencies required by youth workers to effectively integrate AI into their professional activities.

AI technologies significantly influence how young people live, participate and learn. The studies presented  in  Chapter  3  have  explored  the  ways many  young  people  are  using  AI, although lacking a deep understanding of how it works . The Chapter has also highlighted the cultural and gender differences in AI usage and perceptions, as well as the multi-dimensional impact of AI on youth, affecting education, social interactions and psychological well-being.

Youth workers play a critical role in guiding young people to make an effective and responsible use of AI systems .  They can help bridge the knowledge gap, promoting AI literacy and ultimately empowering  young  people  to  understand  and  critically  evaluate  AI. On  the  other  hand,  AI presents numerous opportunities for youth work professionals to augment their competencies .  Practical  examples  of  AI  applications  in  youth  work  settings were presented in Section  3.4,  categorised  based  on  the ETS'  Competence  Model  for  Youth  Workers  to  Work Internationally .  Potential  benefits  and  uses  in  various  competence  areas  have  been  identified, particularly  for  facilitating  learning,  designing  programs,  managing  resources,  collaborating  in teams, communicating meaningfully, displaying intercultural sensitivity, networking and advocating, assessing and evaluating, and being civically engaged.

Chapter 4 has outlined the experiences, needs and challenges of youth workers in relation to AI integration  into  their  practices. The  focus  groups  revealed  that  AI  applications  are  already being  utilised  by  youth  workers  to  enhance various aspects of their professional activities , from tools to overcome language barriers or streamline information organisation to applications for  content  creation  to  enhance  engagement.  Participants  emphasised  the  potential of AI to improve administrative efficiency by automating routine tasks like email responses, scheduling, and data analysis, ultimately allowing youth workers to focus more on direct interactions and strategic planning .

However, several challenges were identified by participants :  data  privacy and security, youth workers' competence gap and resistance to AI technologies due to unfamiliarity and fear of its

potential  impact  on  their  work,  the  potential  for  AI  tools  to  reduce  critical  thinking  and creativity, the risk of over-reliance on technology, and the technical and time-consuming nature of integrating AI into daily workflows.

Participants  in  this  study  emphasised  that a  blend  of  technical,  analytical  and  soft  skills  is crucial for navigating the AI landscape. Participants pointed to the need for all  the competencies  outlined  in  the  European  LifeComp and DigComp Frameworks as fundamental requirements for effectively integrating AI, either as a subject of non-formal learning sessions or as  a  means  to  enhance  their  work.  The  most  recurring  competences  can  be  summarised  as follows:

- Learning-to-learn competencies include  (i) growth mindset ,  (ii) critical thinking, and (iii) managing learning competencies. These competencies are the key to: (i) nurturing a desire to innovate, discover unique solutions and maintain an open mindset towards technological advancements; (ii) evaluating AI-generated content, data and recommendations critically to make informed decisions and avoid potential biases; (iii) recognise knowledge gaps about AI and pursue continuous professional development opportunities to bridge them.
- Personal competencies , including flexibility , are necessary for adaptation and resilience in the face of new technological challenges and changes.
- Social  competences ,  including communication ,  to effectively interact with AI systems and  leverage  AI's  capabilities  to  create  contents  for  written,  verbal  and  visual communications.
- Linked to the previous purpose, participants also mentioned prompt engineering as an essential  skill  for  writing  clear  and  detailed  prompts  and  generating  relevant  and personalised content.
- Digital  competencies: Proficiency  in  using  digital  tools  and  platforms,  essential  for navigating AI tools. Among the digital competencies mentioned by participants, data literacy is  considered an indispensable tool for young people and youth workers , who should have the competences  needed  for  reading,  understanding,  creating  and communicating data effectively, being aware of the origins and destinations of data fed into AI systems.

- AI  literacy: Familiarity  with  AI  concepts, terminology, and applications to understand how  AI  tools  work  and  their  impact  on  youth  work  practices.  This  also  includes awareness  of  various  AI  tools  available  and  how  they  could  be  used  in  different contexts, such as education, communication, marketing, management, and evaluation.
- Ethical Responsibility: Awareness of ethical implications, such as privacy concerns and bias, ensuring AI tools are used to protect and respect young people's rights.
- Organisational  skills: Planning, coordinating resources and integrating AI effectively into youth work.

In conclusion, the AI Competence Framework for Youth Workers must encompass this comprehensive set of knowledge, attitudes and skills which are essential for empowering youth workers to effectively integrate AI into their practices and to thrive in an increasingly AI-driven world.
