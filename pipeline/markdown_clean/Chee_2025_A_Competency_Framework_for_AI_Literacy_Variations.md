This  study  aims  to  develop  a  comprehensive  competency framework for artificial intelligence (AI) literacy, delineating essential competencies and sub-  competencies.  This  framework  and  its  potential  variations,  tailored  to  different  learner  groups (by  educational  level  and  discipline),  can  serve  as a  crucial  reference  for  designing  and  implementing AI  curricula.  However,  the  research  on  AI  literacy by target learners is still in its infancy, and the findings of several existing studies provide inconsistent guidelines  for  educational  practices.  Following  the 2020 PRISMA guidelines, we searched the Web of Science,  Scopus,  and  ScienceDirect  databases  to identify relevant studies published between January 2012 and October 2024. The quality of the included studies  was  evaluated  using  QualSyst.  A  total  of 29  studies  were  identified,  and  their  research  findings were synthesized. Results show that at the K-  12 level,  the  required  competencies  include  basic  AI knowledge, device usage, and AI ethics. For higher education,  the  focus  shifts  to  understanding  data and algorithms, problem-  solving, and career-  related competencies.  For  general  workforce,  emphasis  is placed  on  the  interpretation  and  utilization  of  data and  AI  tools  for  specific  careers,  along  with  error detection and AI-  based decision-  making. This study connects the progression of specific learning objectives, which should be intensively addressed at each stage, to propose an AI literacy education pathway. We discuss the findings, potentials, and limitations of

-  Policies are needed to support a systematic pathway for lifelong AI literacy development from K-  12 education to workforce training.

## I NTRODUCTION

The integration  of  artificial  intelligence  (AI)  into  every  facet  of  life  continues  at  an  everincreasing pace, exerting significant impact on individuals and society as a whole. AI, which ranges from conversational agents such as chatbots to more advanced systems such as humanoid robots, is widely considered a transformative technology that will shape the future of every industry, including, but not limited to, computer-  related fields and areas such as healthcare and education (Holmes et al., 2019; Luckin et al., 2016). For example, in healthcare, AI is used for diagnostic support, treatment planning, and drug discovery. In education, AI is used to personalize learning and improve student engagement and assessment (Luckin et al., 2016; Pearson, 2019). The impact of AI is anticipated to be both far-  reaching and profound and will virtually change all human activities and endeavours.

As AI has the potential to revolutionize the way we work, live, and interact with one another by automating repetitive tasks, improving decision making, and facilitating communication, it is widely agreed that the job market and the competencies required of individuals will also change (Frey &amp; Osborne, 2017). Frey and Osborne (2017) found that jobs highly susceptible to computerization include those in the transportation, logistics, and administrative sectors. A study by the World Economic Forum (2018) revealed that jobs requiring skills in areas such as complex problem solving, critical thinking, and creativity are expected to increase while jobs requiring skills in areas such as data entry and processing are expected to  decline.  Meanwhile, a study by the European Commission (2019) highlighted the projected increase in jobs requiring skills in areas such as communication, collaboration, and emotional intelligence.

The growing consensus is that the changes in the competencies required of individuals due to social changes caused by AI necessitate a corresponding change in education (Kirkwood &amp; Price, 2019; Li et al., 2018; Martinez-  Maldonado &amp; Perez-  Sanagustin, 2019). Kukulska-  Hulme, Beirne, et al. (2020) proposed the concept of education FOR AI (preparing individuals to work with AI and develop AI systems) and education WITH AI (using AI to enhance teaching and learning), with the former encompassing a broader scope. Educational research, particularly into AI literacy, should provide critical and fundamental guidance for education FOR AI . The prevalence of AI demands the acquisition of new knowledge because individuals need a comprehensive understanding of the AI technologies and phenomena to adapt effectively to these changes (Yi, 2021). Literacy now entails more than just the ability to read and write, as traditionally referred to; it includes the ability to network and access a wider range of information (Long &amp; Magerko, 2020). Efforts to increase literacy have been linked to political and social empowerment. Literacy has evolved from being a technology exclusive to experts to becoming an integral part of everyday life. Similar to the development of writing, AI has entered the realm of everyday life, becoming a goal of basic literacy.

As technology advances, research into various forms of literacycomputer literacy , ICT (Information  and  Communication Technology) literacy ,  and digital  literacy -has evolved over the past several decades to address an increasingly broad range of abilities, reflecting rapid developments in technology. Computer literacy studies began in the 1960s and 1970s with the advent of personal computers and defined computer literacy as one's ability to use and understand basic computer hardware and software. Focusing primarily on the technical skills required to operate computers, it included an understanding of how to input data, navigate and use the operating system, and perform basic tasks such as creating and  editing  documents  (Lee  &amp;  Mestre,  1999;  Reynolds,  2015;  Warschauer,  2003). ICT literacy studies began in the 1980s and 1990s as the internet and other forms of communication technology became more widely available. These studies expanded the definition of computer literacy to include the use and understanding of various forms of communication technology, such as the internet, email, and mobile devices. They also deemed ICT literacy to include the ability to use these technologies and to access, manage, and create information (Livingstone, 2008; UNESCO IITE, 2018). Digital literacy studies began in the early 2000s as the use of digital technology continued to expand and the internet became a central part of everyday life. Digital literacy is considered an even broader concept than ICT literacy and includes not only the ability to use technology but also the ability to critically  evaluate,  create,  and  communicate  information  using  digital  media  (Eshet,  2004). Recent studies on digital literacy suggest that, to respond more agilely and responsibly to the technological advancements of the AI era, it is necessary to expand the scope of digital literacy (Tiernan et al., 2023).

Research on AI literacy emerged in the early 2000s, initially overlapping with digital literacy studies, particularly in areas such as digital transformation, ethics, and responsible  AI  (European Commission, 2019). However, AI literacy, as it is understood today,

has gained momentum more recently, particularly after 2020, reflecting the growing prevalence of AI technologies in everyday life (Miao et al., 2021). The concept evolved from focusing on basic AI concepts and technologies to encompassing a broader scope that includes understanding social and ethical implications, as well as using AI across various domains. Ng et al. (2021) define AI literacy as the ability to understand, use, monitor, and critically reflect on AI applications, emphasizing not only comprehension but also application and evaluation in diverse contexts. AI literacy now became to aim to equip individuals with skills for effective interaction with AI systems, informed decision-  making, and understanding AI's broader societal implications, reflecting the increased prevalence and sophistication of AI technologies.

Given that AI literacy can be defined as a comprehensive set of competencies enabling individuals  to  critically  evaluate  AI  technologies,  effectively  communicate  and  collaborate with AI, and utilize AI as a tool in various settings, such as online, at home, and in the  workplace (Long &amp; Magerko, 2020), research on the competency framework of AI literacy  can  serve  as  a  crucial  reference  for  designing  and  implementing  AI  curricula (Kong et al., 2023). Several efforts have attempted to list relevant competencies. Long and Magerko (2020) proposed 17 AI competencies, which include recognizing AI, understanding the concept of intelligence, identifying the steps involved in machine learning, critically interpreting AI outputs, data literacy, and adhering to ethical standards in AI usage. Almatrafi et al. (2024) identified AI literacy competencies as recognizing, knowing and understanding, using and applying, evaluating, creating, and navigating ethically.  Both studies emphasize a comprehensive approach to AI literacy, focusing on understanding and utilizing AI. In contrast, Huang (2021) identified key AI competencies with a greater emphasis on cognitive and soft skills, categorizing them into knowledge, teamwork, and learning domains, further subdividing them into skill and cultural competence, teamwork and human-  tool collaboration competence, and cognitive and self-  learning competence. This difference in focus underscores the varied perspectives within AI literacy research, with some studies concentrating on the technical understanding and application of AI, while others emphasize the cognitive and interpersonal skills necessary for effective AI engagement. The findings from available studies remain inconsistent and lack a comprehensive framework that integrates these diverse perspectives.

Furthermore, while studies on AI competencies exist for specific learner groups, a comprehensive framework spanning the entire life stage continuum is lacking. Research has focused  on  various  educational  levels,  including  early  childhood  (Su  et  al.,  2023),  K-  12 (Casal-  Otero et al., 2023; Ng et al., 2023; Sanusi et al., 2022), and higher and adult education (Laupichler, Aster, et al., 2022; Ng et al., 2021), often yielding inconsistent results. For instance, Casal-  Otero et al. (2023) emphasized understanding AI operations and using AI tools, while Sanusi et al. (2022) proposed key competencies for students with notable emphasis on team competence, including teamwork and human-  tool collaboration. In contrast, Ng et al. (2023) proposed a broader framework that addresses affective, behavioural, cognitive, and ethical domains. Additionally, studies have explored AI competencies within specific disciplines such as engineering (Cantú-  Ortiz et al., 2020), medicine (Karaca et al., 2021; Wartman &amp; Combs, 2019), nursing (Swan, 2021), and communication (Dergaa et al., 2023). However, comparative analyses across multiple disciplines remain scarce. This fragmented approach highlights critical gaps: the need to systematically examine how AI competencies vary by educational level and discipline, and the absence of research that provides a comprehensive pathway for developing AI literacy competencies throughout one's educational and working life. This study aims to address these caveats and provide a comprehensive overview  of  composing  competencies  for  an  AI  literacy  framework  with  its  variations  by different learner groups and possible pathways towards becoming AI-  literate. We have accordingly posed the following research questions:

|

1.  What  competencies  and  sub-  competencies  constitute  an  AI  literacy  framework?
2. How do these competencies vary by educational level and discipline?
3. What could be a possible pathway for equipping learners with competencies in AI literacy, starting from K-  12 through college students and extending to working adults and the general public?

## METHODS

This review was planned, conducted, and reported according to the updated guidelines for reporting systematic reviews of the 2020 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-  Analyses (PRISMA) (Page et al., 2021).

## Search strategy

We searched Web of Science (1900-present), Scopus (1970-present), and ScienceDirect (1995-present) for records from January 2012 (the year when interest in AI from academia and industry started to increase) to October 2024. Using Boolean operators and wildcards, we grouped search terms into three categories: (1) AI (AI OR Artificial intelligence*), (2) education (education* OR learn* OR teach* OR instruct* OR school*), and (3) AI literacy (AI literacy OR artificial intelligence literacy OR competenc*OR capacit*). An experienced librarian verified the search strategies.

## Inclusion and exclusion criteria

We  included  peer-  reviewed  journal  publications  from  January  1,  2012  to  October  1, 2024, written in English, focusing on AI literacy in education. Original research, including  quantitative,  qualitative,  and  review  studies,  was  included;  commentaries,  letters, editorials, and book chapters were excluded. We included studies on K-  12, higher education,  vocational  education,  and  general  public  education  but  excluded  expert  training  for  AI  developers  or  programmers.  We  also  excluded  studies  on  using  AI  to  train specific competencies required in certain areas, ie, education with AI (Kukulska-  Hulme, Hammond, &amp; Sharples, 2020, p. 11) (Table A1). Three authors independently and collaboratively screened titles, abstracts, and full texts of studies identified through our search. Disagreements  were  resolved  through  discussion  until  consensus  was  reached,  with inclusion and exclusion criteria reviewed and refined during meetings for the first 100 items. We assessed inter-  rater reliability using Fleiss Kappa, evaluating consistency by randomly selecting 30 articles at each stage. Fleiss's Kappa values were 0.75 for title screening, 0.78 for abstract screening, and 0.79 for full-  text review, indicating excellent inter-  rater reliability across all stages.

## Data extraction

Three authors initially developed a comprehensive data extraction sheet through iterative testing and revision. This sheet was designed to capture key information from each study, including  study  characteristics,  methodological  details,  participant  information,  definitions of AI literacy, identified AI competencies and sub-  competencies, and target learner groups categorized by school level and discipline. The authors independently extracted

data from the selected studies using this sheet. To ensure efficiency and thoroughness, they divided the studies among themselves. Each author meticulously reviewed their assigned studies, completing the data extraction sheet for each. Before proceeding with the full extraction process, the authors cross-  checked a random sample of 20% of the studies ( n = 5) to verify the accuracy and consistency of the extracted data. Regular meetings were  held  throughout  the  extraction  process  to  maintain  consistency  and  resolve  any discrepancies. During these meetings, they discussed any ambiguities in data interpretation and collectively addressed any issues that arose. In cases of disagreement, all three authors jointly reviewed the study in question and reached a consensus through discussion. The final data extraction sheet included only the data agreed upon by all authors after thorough review and discussion.

Data coding were conducted using a structured scheme that categorized studies based on three dimensions: research method, target learners, and AI literacy main/sub competencies. The research methods were classified as: 1.1 Quantitative (survey, scale development), 1.2 Qualitative (interview, observation, case study, curriculum design, scale development), 1.3 Mixed methods, and 1.4 Review (systematic review, narrative review). Target learners were categorized as: 2.1 K-  12, 2.2 higher education (with specific disciplines), 2.3 teacher, 2.4 workforce, 2.5 general public and 2.6 organization. The AI literacy competencies were analysed,  reconstructed  and  expanded  based  on  the  UNESCO  Digital  Literacy  Global Framework,  which  includes:  3.1  Devices  and  software  operations,  3.2  Information  and data literacy, 3.3 Communication and collaboration, 3.4 Digital content creation, Safety, 3.5 Problem solving, and 3.6 Career-  related competences.

## Assessment of study quality

The quantitative and qualitative studies were assessed using QualSyst (Kmet et al., 2004), and review studies were assessed using the JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist for Text and Opinion (JBI, 2020). The Standard Quality Assessment Criteria comprise 14 items for quantitative studies and 10 items for qualitative studies. We followed the four-  level quality standard based on the summary mean score percentage: &gt; 80% as strong, 70%-80% as good, 50%-70% as adequate, and &lt; 50% as low quality (Sim et al., 2016). One study, scoring 32%, was excluded. The average quality score of the 29 assessed studies was 77%, indicating strong and good quality. One study was assessed by the JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist for Text and Opinion, which has 6 items. We followed the 50% cutoff score (3 items) for inclusion (Hopia &amp; Heikkilä, 2020). The study scored 83%; thus, no study was excluded. The three authors independently and collaboratively performed quality assessments and resolved substantial differences through discussions.

## RESULTS

## Trial flow

In total, 947 articles were identified from the three academic databases. After the removal of 253 duplicates, 694 potentially relevant articles were retained. Next, 225 articles remained eligible after 469 articles were eliminated based on their titles. In the abstract screening phase, 83 articles remained eligible after removing 142 articles. Then, 29 articles were included after 54 articles were removed during the full text screening phase. Figure 1 presents the exclusion process for article identification following the PRISMA guidelines.

## Study characteristics of reviewed articles

Based on the analysis of the 29 articles, the most common type of study was quantitative (34%), followed by review studies (31%), mixed-  method (24%), and qualitative studies (10%). Among the 17 studies with participants, 41% involved K-  12 students, 24% college students, 18% teachers, 12% working adults, and 6% general public. The number of participants varied widely from 11 to 13,000. The most frequently reported research topics were (a) identifying key AI competencies ( n = 17, 59%), (b) developing curricula for AI literacy education ( n = 6, 21%), (c) teaching AI ethics ( n = 4, 14%), and (d) developing AI literacy scale ( n = 2,  7%).  Detailed information on the reviewed studies is provided in Table A2.

## RQ1. Competencies/sub-  competencies comprising AI literacy

AI literacy competencies are defined by the knowledge of AI concepts and processes and the use of AI software, applications, and platforms ( n = 25, 86%); thinking and problem solving using AI technology ( n = 14,  48%);  communicating  and  collaborating  with AI, including human-tool and human-human collaborations ( n = 13,  45%);  awareness of the opportunities and threats of AI and concern about AI ethics ( n = 18,  62%); and having  confidence  and  self-  efficacy  in  using  AI  technology  ( n = 3,  10%).  (For  definitions of the AI literacy compared with digital literacy, see Table A3) We analysed the studies to identify the competencies and sub-  competencies that constitute AI literacy.

|

Based on UNESCO Digital Literacy Global Framework, we analysed and reconstructed the  AI  literacy  competencies  from  the  29  studies  and  obtained  8  competencies  and 18 sub-  competencies. (For a comparison between AI literacy and digital literacy competencies,  see  Table  A4)  The  competencies  are:  (1)  AI  device  and  software/application/platform operations ( n = 12, 41%), (2) data and algorithm literacy ( n = 23, 79%), (3) problem solving ( n = 14, 50%), (4) communication and collaboration ( n = 13, 46%), (5) AI ethics ( n = 18, 62%), (6) career-  related competences ( n = 11, 39%), (7) AI content creation ( n = 7 , 25%), (7) affective competences ( n = 3, 11%). Most studies included multiple competencies and were counted in duplicate. The order of the competencies was determined by importance and difficulty. The final competency framework for AI literacy is presented in Table 1.

## RQ2. Variations of competencies of different learner groups

Three studies included more than one target learner for AI literacy competencies; therefore, these studies were counted in duplicate, resulting in 36 targets derived from the 29 studies. 13 studies targeted K-  12 students ( n = 13, 36%), 9 studies targeted college students ( n = 9, 25%), and 5 studies targeted workforce ( n = 5, 14%), 5 studies targeted teachers ( n = 5, 14%), 3 studies targeted general public ( n = 3,  8%), and one study targeted organizations ( n = 1, 3%). Categorizing the 29 studies by discipline, 2 studies were IT and engineering majors ( n = 2, 7%,), 4 studies were education ( n = 4, 14%), 1 study was communication ( n = 1, 3%), 5 studies were medicine ( n = 5, 17%), 1 study was nursing ( n = 1, 3%), and 10 studies did not identify discipline ( n = 1 1, 38%).

Tables 2 and 3 show the AI literacy competencies by learner group according to school level and discipline, respectively. The percentage represents the proportion of studies mentioning each competency to the total studies addressing AI literacy competencies at each education level.

The competencies of AI literacy required of K-  12 learners were primarily centered on the AI ethics (26%), data and algorithm literacy (21%), and device and software/application/platform operations (21%). In higher education, the competencies with the highest priority were identified in the areas of data and algorithm literacy (25%), problem solving (18%),  and career-  related  competencies (18%).  The  AI  literacy  demands  for  teachers were primarily centered on data and algorithm literacy (26%), AI content creation (21%) and device and software operations (16%). In the case of organizations, the most prominent  AI  literacy  competencies  were  identified  as data and algorithm literacy , problem solving , and career-  related competencies , each accounting for 33% of the total. For general workforce, the most significant AI competency requirements were in the domains of data and algorithm literacy (21%) and career-  related competencies (21%). Finally, in general public contexts, the most essential AI literacy competencies were AI device and software/application/platform operations , data and algorithm literacy , each accounting for 21% of the total.

Meanwhile, the competencies for AI literacy were drawn by discipline as well. In the field of technology, the highest priority was identified in the areas of data and algorithm literacy (24%) and AI device and software/application/platform operations (20%). In the field of engineering, the most prominent AI literacy competencies were identified as data and algorithm literacy and problem solving at 25% each. In education, the highest priorities were identified for data and algorithm literacy (24%), AI content creation (24%), AI device and software/application/platform operations (18%). In the field of communication, the essential competencies required were AI device and software/application/platform operations , communication and collaboration, AI ethics , and career-  related competencies , each accounting for 25% of

## RQ3. A possible pathway for equipping learners with competencies for AI literacy

Based on the competencies required for K-  12 students, college students, and general workforce depicted in Table 2, Figure 2 illustrates a possible pathway for equipping learners with the competencies for AI literacy that progresses from the K-  12 level to the higher education and general workforce levels. In K-  12 education, AI literacy focuses on acquiring the fundamental concepts and applications of AI. Furthermore, emphasis is placed on fostering awareness and understanding of the moral and social implications of AI, including the issues related to privacy and transparency. At the higher education level, AI literacy competencies tend to be more advanced and specialized. Learners at this stage are expected to possess the ability to solve problems by utilizing their foundational knowledge of AI and their  proficiency  in  data  and  algorithms. These competencies are particularly relevant to career-  related competencies that are of paramount importance in shaping career paths after graduation. Thus, the focus of AI education at the general workforce level is on developing career-  related competencies, with particular emphasis on the ability to analyse information and data generated within a specific field.

## DISCUSSION

This study examined the AI literacy framework, investigated competency variations across educational stages and fields, and explored a pathway for equipping learners with AI literacy from K-  12 to working life. Findings reveal distinct competency requirements ranging from basic AI knowledge and ethics at K-  12 to advanced data analysis and problem-  solving in higher education and workforce settings. Theoretical and practical implications, potentials, and limitations are discussed with future research suggestions.

## Competencies/sub-  competencies of AI literacy

The main competencies for AI literacy include (1) AI device, software, application, and platform knowledge; (2) basic understanding and application of AI/data algorithms; (3) problem solving using AI software; (4) communication and collaboration in AI contexts; (5) AI ethics and social  issues  awareness;  (6)  career-  specific  AI  competencies;  (7)  AI-  based  content creation; and (8) Affective competences in using AI.

AI  literacy  can  be  compared  to  computer  literacy  in  the  1980s  (eg,  Papert,  1980) and digital literacy in the 1990s (eg, Gilster, 1997), which includes computer, ICT, information, and media literacy. This comparison shows how each literacy type aligns with

technological advancements and societal needs, demonstrating evolving skills necessary to navigate changing digital landscapes.

The  transition  from  computer  to  digital  literacy  reflects  the  emergence  of  AI  literacy. Computer literacy focused on understanding and using computer hardware and software, including operating software, basic computer abilities, and elementary problem-  solving. As technology and social contexts changed, digital literacy expanded these concepts, defined by UNESCO (Law et al., 2018) as 'the ability to access, manage, understand, integrate, communicate, evaluate and create information safely and appropriately through digital technologies for employment, decent jobs and entrepreneurship.' (p. 6). This shift from computer to  digital  literacy  signifies  a  move  beyond  technical  proficiency  to  encompass  skills  and understanding necessary for effective functioning, participation,  and  responsibility  in  the digital world.

The advent of AI literacy extends this trend further, demanding a deeper understanding of the complexities and ethical considerations of AI technologies. AI literacy introduces a set of interesting capabilities (Tables A3 and A4).

First, understanding and applying knowledge about data and algorithms (2.2) is crucial as it enables individuals to discern how AI systems make decisions and how they can be applied in various contexts. This capability is complemented by data-  based decision making (3.3), where leveraging vast amounts of data for rational and insightful conclusions becomes the norm, emphasizing the importance of critical thinking and analytical skills.

with AI technologies further enriches this literacy as it involves human-  to-  tool interaction (4.1), optimizing how we utilize AI to augment our capabilities. Equally critical is mastering human-  to-  human communication in an AI-  mediated environment (4.2) and recognizing how AI can transform traditional communication channels and practices. Additionally, awareness of the dual-  edged nature of AI, its opportunities and threats, rounds out this literacy, is necessary to maintain balanced perspective on the ethical, social, and professional impacts of AI. In the vocational context, this capability necessitates the ability to recognize the potential for incorrect outcomes, verify AI-  generated results for accuracy, and make rational decisions based on validated data (6.3). The increasing influence of technology on society is evident in the transition from computer literacy to digital literacy and, subsequently, to AI literacy, aligning with Marshall McLuhan's media theory, which argues that technology is more than a tool; it functions as an environment that profoundly shapes society and culture, moulding our perception and experience of the world (McLuhan, 1964). Finally, cultivating affective competencies, including confidence and self-  efficacy, is essential in the acquisition and application of AI knowledge (8.1). As learners build confidence in interacting with AI technologies, their interest and motivation to pursue academic and professional opportunities in the AI field are enhanced (Ng et al., 2023). This emotional shift serves as a key driver in developing AI-  based problem-  solving skills and career-  relevant competencies.

The  final  AI  literacy  framework  elucidates  distinct  differences  when  juxtaposed  with similar  studies,  notably  those  of  Ng  et  al.  (2021,  2023),  Long  and  Magerko  (2020),  and UNESCO (Cukurova &amp; Miao, 2024) as depicted in Table A5. A salient distinction lies in the

absence of career-  related competencies. While the omission in Long and Magerko (2020) and Ng et al. (2023) could be attributed to its focus on K-  12 students, the exclusion from Ng et al.'s (2021) study, which also addresses higher education, merits attention. Although it is challenging for higher education to fully meet the vocational needs of all students, the inclusion of career-  related competencies, especially competency 6.3 ( Verifying AI results for accuracy and making rational decisions based on validated data ), which is crucial and not limited to specific professions-seems appropriate, aligning with societal demands. This notion is supported by other studies included in this analysis, which advocate for incorporating such competencies from the outset of higher education. The latest AI Competency Framework for Teachers, released by UNESCO in 2024, partially addresses these needs. The AI for professional development component emphasizes the capacity of teachers to adapt AI tools to support student professional growth and foster effective AI use. However, this component primarily focuses on the role of teachers in facilitating personalized learning and strategies within broader contexts of lifelong and collaborative organizational learning. As such,  it  diverges  from  the  career-  specific  competencies  outlined  in  this  study,  which emphasize skills for analysing, evaluating, and making informed decisions using AI technologies in specialized professional settings. In contrast to the four studies that only partially incorporate competencies or presented them within specific contexts, this study adopts a more comprehensive approach to amalgamating AI competencies and delineates how their composition and prioritization should vary according to the educational level and major of learner groups.

## Competency variations across different learner groups

This study sets itself apart by delineating AI literacy competency requirements tailored to diverse educational levels and specific disciplines. It offers a unique contribution to the field by addressing the nuanced needs of different learner groups while considering the developmental stages and professional characteristics of each group. AI literacy education is not a one-  size-  fits-  all model but rather a nuanced, multidimensional construct that caters to the specific needs and capabilities of different learner groups.

## AI device and software/application/platform operations

This competency is generally emphasized at the K-  12 and general public levels and in the field of education. Specifically, K-  12 students need to develop a fundamental understanding of AI, along with the use of various AI devices, software, and applications, thereby laying a strong foundation for future AI education. It naturally becomes essential for education majors, who will be teaching these students, to possess the competency (Chiu &amp; Chai, 2020; Kong &amp; Abelson, 2019). For general public, possessing basic AI skills is becoming an essential competency in the AI era, similar to the daily use of cell phones and notebooks by ordinary individuals.

## Data and algorithm literacy

This competency, highlighted as the most important across all learner levels, underscores the need for a deeper understanding of how AI and algorithms work. Dogruel et al. (2022) define algorithmic literacy as 'the ability to understand algorithms, critically evaluate them, and have appropriate skills to cope with algorithmic systems' (p. 5). This competency is significant in

.

higher education, general workforce, and organizational levels, where problem-  solving and career-  related competencies are required. Tuomi (2018) noted that while vocational education focuses on domain-  specific knowledge, the demand for competencies like problem solving, critical thinking, and decision making is growing. This aligns with our findings on required competencies in medicine, healthcare, nursing, and engineering. Understanding AI models and their outputs is vital for model interpretability, enabling users to trust AI recommendations, explain decisions, and identify biases. For example, generative AI, optimized for pattern recognition and natural language processing, has limitations in traditional quantitative analysis. Choosing the right AI model for a specific task is vital for effectively using AI in problem solving, indicating the need for comprehensive educational strategies.

## AI ethics

This competency is particularly essential within the K-  12 group, reflecting the importance of students not only using AI effectively but also grasping its ethical and social implications. The OECD and UNICEF have emphasized the significance of AI ethics, including transparency, fairness, and accountability (Ng et al., 2021; UNICEF, 2019). Given that individuals aged 12-25 years are in the conventional moral period and are developing an understanding of social laws and moral norms (Kohlberg, 1984), K-  12 learners must be educated about using AI responsibly and ethically and be equipped with appropriate values and perspectives (Hutchins et al., 2020). Among various disciplines, communication necessitates profound competency in AI ethics. The ability to discern accurate information from falsehoods and generate trustworthy content is imperative (Alser &amp; Waisberg, 2023; Jarrah et al., 2023), implying a need for appropriate workforce training in this area.

## Communication and collaboration

This  competency was identified  as  the  most  necessary  across  disciplines,  primarily  because of the need to harness AI tools for specific tasks and to engage in discussions and collaborations (Swan, 2021). This requirement is most pronounced in nursing and communication, underscoring the need for proficiency in human-tool interactivity. This competency includes human-  to-  tool collaboration through AI , such as that in the use of AI-  driven medical applications for patient management or generative AI for journalistic endeavours (CantúOrtiz et al., 2020; Dergaa et al., 2023); and human-  to-  human collaboration through AI , such as that in engagements in team-  based discussions to adjust changing roles and workflows using AI-  based tools (Russell et al., 2023).

## AI content creation

This  competency  is  predominantly  observed  among  educators  and  engineering  majors. In  engineering  education,  efforts  are  increasingly  focused  on  nurturing  creativity  among prospective  engineers,  underpinned  by  research  advocating  for  creative  outputs  through programming language activities, which are becoming part of the curriculum for K-  12 and engineering students (Hutchins et al., 2020; Lin et al., 2019). In parallel, AI content creation competency is essential for teachers designing and implementing AI-  incorporated curricula. From the perspective of the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework, which outlines key knowledge for educators to effectively integrate technology into teaching, AI content creation competency engages with its three core components: technological

|

knowledge (TK), pedagogical knowledge (PK), and content knowledge (CK) (Kim et al., 2021). This competency encompasses understanding and applying AI technologies (TK), integrating these technologies into teaching methodologies (PK), and applying AI within specific subject matter contexts (CK). AI content creation competency is essential for educators to prepare students for a future where technology and education intersect, ensuring teaching strategies are technologically advanced, pedagogically sound, and content-  relevant, fostering an educational environment responsive to the needs of the AI era.

## A possible pathway for equipping learners with competencies for AI literacy

This study presents an AI literacy competency framework and a developmental pathway for AI education across educational levels and life stages. It emphasizes the importance of implementing a long-  term, strategic approach to provide age-  appropriate AI education to ensure that individuals acquire the necessary knowledge and skills to navigate an AI era. The findings of this study, particularly regarding which competencies are crucial at different stages, warrant discussion in light of human cognitive and moral development theories (eg, Piaget (1952), Kohlberg (1984)), as well as in comparison with previous AI literacy research.

K-  12 education, according to our findings, focuses on developing fundamental AI knowledge, including basic programming concepts and AI systems. More importantly, K-  12 education  prioritizes  AI  ethics  to  address  ethical  issues  and  dilemmas  in  AI  development and deployment, promoting responsible AI usage (Kong et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023). These  competencies  correspond  to  Piaget's  (1952)  concrete  operational  stage  and Kohlberg's (1984) conventional level of moral reasoning. This alignment is evident in the emphasis on developing logical thinking about tangible AI concepts and internalizing ethical norms for AI use, as highlighted by Kong et al. (2023) and Zhang et al. (2023). These findings also align with the three core dimensions of AI literacy competencies-AI concepts, AI applications, and AI ethics-presented in the studies by Long and Magerko (2020) and Casal-  Otero et al. (2023). Curriculum designers should align AI education with students' cognitive and moral developmental stages, introducing AI concepts through tangible examples for younger students and progressing to more abstract concepts and complex ethical scenarios  as  students  grow.  AI  ethics  education  should  evolve  from  simple  rules-  based approaches to nuanced discussions of ethical dilemmas, reflecting students' moral reasoning development (Holmes et al., 2019). In higher education, the focus shifts to developing in-  depth AI knowledge, including data and algorithm literacy and AI-  based problem-  solving skills. This shift aligns with Piaget's formal operational stage and the development of abstract reasoning abilities. Students engage in tasks such as developing basic AI algorithms to address specific challenges, which deepens their understanding of AI and its practical applications (Schmohl et al., 2022; Yadav et al., 2012). This progression reflects the maturation of higher-  order thinking skills, specifically computational thinking (Wing, 2006) and algorithmic thinking (Futschek, 2006), enabling students to solve complex problems using AI. The emphasis on problem-  solving and AI content creation in our study underscores the importance of these advanced cognitive skills, which align with the Use and Apply and Evaluate and Create competencies proposed by Ng et al. (2021) in their AI literacy framework. To foster these competencies, Laupichler, Hadizadeh, et al. (2022) advocate for practice-  oriented curricula that cultivate higher-  order thinking skills. Furthermore, collaborations between educational institutions and industry partners can enhance this approach, bridging theoretical knowledge with real-  world applications (Cantú-  Ortiz et al., 2020) and preparing students for the cognitive demands of AI-  driven workplaces.

.

In  workforce  training,  the  focus  is  on  developing  field-  specific  AI  literacy  reflecting the diverse and specialized nature of working environments. Research on AI literacy at the  workforce  education  level  identifies  competencies  such  as  determining  the  appropriateness of technology for a given situation, using AI programs to analyse data and interpret  results,  and  explaining  these  findings  to  colleagues  or  patients  (Laupichler, Hadizadeh, et al., 2022; Malerbi et al., 2023; McCoy et al., 2020). This study identified these competencies as career-  related  competences ,  which  involve  the  ability  to  utilize specialized AI technologies and understand, analyse, and evaluate data, information, and AI-  based content specific to particular fields. There is a need for educational programs that strengthen these career-  related competences to ensure the effective use of AI in the workplace. Workforce AI literacy education should adopt andragogical approaches that emphasize  self-  directed,  experience-  based  learning  (Knowles,  1984)  and  incorporate cycles of concrete experience, reflection, conceptualization, and active experimentation with AI technologies in professional contexts (Kolb, 1984). While it is crucial to tailor AI literacy education to specific career needs, it is equally important to maintain a focus on developing transferable, interdisciplinary AI competencies that support boundaryless career trajectories and enable professionals to adapt to the evolving AI landscape across various fields (Arthur &amp; Rousseau, 1996).

Affective competencies are critical for the general public as they emphasize the importance of cultivating traits such as confidence and self-  efficacy, enabling individuals to effectively acquire knowledge and adapt within the rapidly evolving landscape of AI technology. These competencies, inherently linked to emotional factors, shape individuals' attitudes towards AI, which in turn influence their interest, intention, and willingness to engage with AI in learning contexts (Compeau &amp; Higgins, 1995; Davis, Bagozzi, &amp; Warshaw, 1989; Ferdousi, 2019; Ng et al., 2023). Thus, it is imperative to design pedagogical strategies and curricula that embed affective competencies within adult and lifelong education, fostering sustained motivation, engagement, and AI literacy among the public.

This study also highlights the importance of maintaining general AI literacy for adults and seniors. As AI technologies increasingly integrate into everyday life, it is essential for individuals of all ages to grasp the basics of AI and its implications. Lifelong learning initiatives, community workshops, and online resources can offer accessible and engaging AI education tailored to adult learners. This study underscores the importance of specialized AI literacy education tailored to different disciplines, requiring accurate analysis of potential impacts of AI and discipline-  specific curricula development. It demonstrates that AI literacy comprises concrete competencies that evolve through life stages, paralleling educational adaptation to human development, cognitive growth, and vocational growth. The study is meaningful because it found that AI literacy can be embodied in each core and sub-  competency, forming an organically connected flow rather than independent concepts.

In  a  society  intertwined  with  AI,  understanding,  interpreting,  and  utilizing  AI  will  be a fundamental life competency. The AI competency framework shows that effective AI utilization necessitates general competencies, such as critical thinking, effective communication, collaboration with people and AI tools, ethical judgement and affective competency such as self-  efficacy in the use of AI. This underscores the critical role of 'human consciousness' as the cornerstone of these competencies. While AI can process data, it  lacks  the  ability  to  make  decisions based on critical considerations (Frick, 2024). AI systems fall short of fully grasping human communication (Baidoo-  Anu &amp; Ansah, 2023; Marcus &amp; Davis, 2020) as they cannot interpret emotional subtleties and human relationships' complexities. Moreover, AI does not possess the capacity for ethical discernment (Damasio, 2019; Swan, 2021), a domain in which humans evaluate values through culture, personal experience, and emotional factors. In modern society, recognizing the limitations of AI and understanding it as a technology shaped by human agency is essential

(Cukurova &amp; Miao, 2024). Recent advancements in AI research, particularly the emphasis on human-  centered AI, reveal a growing societal consensus that AI should support and augment human capabilities rather than replace them (Capel &amp; Brereton, 2023; Garibay et al., 2023; Shneiderman et al., 2020). Humans must be central throughout the AI lifecycle-design,  implementation,  evaluation,  operation,  maintenance,  decommissioning, and governance-to ensure high levels of oversight and control (Bond et al., 2019; Shneiderman, 2020). A human consciousness approach is necessary in AI design and use, aligning AI with human values, protecting human agency, and embedding social and ethical responsibility. Critical reflection on the extent to which AI can replace human cognition and decision-  making, along with active participation in creating an AI-  integrated society, is imperative. This emphasizes the need for thoughtful integration of AI in education across all life stages and academic disciplines. This requirement is predicated on the understanding that human consciousness represents the quintessential human attribute in a future society intertwined with AI, denoting the pinnacle of AI literacy essential for navigating a life augmented by AI technologies.

This  study  has  several  limitations  that  should  be  acknowledged.  First,  by  focusing solely on peer-  reviewed journal articles, we may have inadvertently excluded valuable insights from grey literature such as conference proceedings, accreditation documents, and policy papers. This selective approach, while ensuring academic rigour, potentially limits the breadth of our analysis. Second, the relatively small number of studies synthesized in this review may pose challenges to the generalizability of our findings. However, this limitation is balanced by the depth of analysis and the valuable integration of diverse perspectives on AI literacy within specific educational contexts, which aligns with our study's primary objective. Third, our exclusion of studies related to the education and training of AI developers or programmers was a deliberate choice based on our focus on AI literacy as a fundamental skill. While this decision allowed us to maintain a clear distinction between basic literacy and specialized technical competencies, it inevitably narrows the scope of our research. Literacy, as a basic human skill encompassing the ability to read, write, and comprehend (Berry et al., 1997; Tavdgiridze, 2016), forms the foundation of our study. This focus on fundamental skills differentiates our research from studies on specialized AI competencies required for AI professionals in the field. Moreover, the exclusion of non-  English studies likely resulted in the omission of diverse perspectives and approaches from researchers worldwide, narrowing our understanding of global trends in AI-  based education. Future research should address these limitations by expanding the scope to include grey literature, increasing the sample size of studies, and potentially incorporating perspectives from AI professional training. Such expansions would contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of AI literacy across various contexts and skill levels. Furthermore, we anticipate that this framework will serve as a cornerstone for forthcoming empirical inquiries, facilitating the refinement of the proposed framework. For example, it is imperative to develop measurement tools based on the competency framework derived from this study. Such tools would enable the assessment of learners' current states, and facilitate the application of tailored educational programs. This direction promises to enhance the effectiveness of AI literacy education and contributes to the personalized advancement of learner competencies in navigating AI environments.

## CONCLUSION

The evolution of technology towards increased user-  friendliness and intuitiveness marks a significant shift from an era requiring substantial training for technological proficiency to one in which such extensive preparation is largely unnecessary. This leap in the usability

.

of technology, from the intensive training once necessary for PC mastery to the intuitive engagement with advanced devices and generative AI, shifts the focus of literacy related to that technology, in this study, AI. In other words, what matters is not the use of AI but the integration of AI into work and life. Therefore, AI education should progress from teaching how to use AI to teaching how to integrate it critically, strategically, responsibly, and ethically into our lives and professions, underpinned by a deeper understanding of the technology and underlying algorithms and their broader societal impacts and implications. This study demonstrates that AI and AI education exemplify this transition. We hope that this study not only contributes to educational practices and research but also inspires a proactive approach to embracing AI, ensuring that it serves as a beneficial and sustainable extension of human capability.
