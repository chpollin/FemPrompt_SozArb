## 1. Introduction

In  recent  years,  the  capabilities  of  artificial  intelligence  (AI), particularly  machine  learning  and  deep  learning  algorithms,  have expanded  explosively.  This  development  naturally  translates  into increasingly extensive use of AI, with profound implications, notably its effects on labour (Frank et al., 2019). Although AI may generate more jobs than it will destroy (World Economic Forum, 2020), most of the current workforce cannot readily transfer to newly created roles, and the future workforce will need specialised education to work with AI. The use of AI to complement and augment the efforts of human workers, leading  to  synergistic  AI -worker  partnership  and  collaboration,  has been advocated (Dede et al., 2021; Karakose et al., 2023). Indeed, as AI is increasingly applied to non-labour-intensive tasks, including decision-making (Duan et al., 2019) and art creation (Ma et al., 2023), there is intensifying pressure on the current and future workforce to be

The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) in the workplace is pressuring employees to learn how to harness this technology. The goal of promoting AI literacy is to equip educated citizens with the readiness to apply AI. The aim of this  study  is  to  provide  evidence  to  guide  the  development  of  an  AI  Literacy  Framework  to  prepare educated citizens to participate in future society. We report on a 14-h AI literacy course for senior secondary students,  emphasising  problem-solving  competence  development  and  adopting  the  project-based  learning approach. One hundred and twenty-eight students completed the course, and a mixed-methods analysis was conducted to evaluate the results. A post-course test showed that the course had improved the students ' ability to use  AI  concepts  in  solving  real-life  problems.  Self-surveys  indicated  that  the  students  showed  a  significant improvement in their metacognitive strategies in problem-solving, and had a better understanding of the ethical boundaries and principles that govern the use of AI for problem-solving. A thematic analysis of data drawn from focus group interviews with the students and their self-reflective writings indicated that PBL supported them in reflecting critically on the ethical use of AI and developing their problem-solving competence. Future studies should consider validating the course evaluation instruments among a more extensive and diverse population.

adequately prepared for an AI future.

'AI  literacy ' refers  to  the  elements  that  the  workforce  needs  to harness AI and form a synergistic relationship with the technology. It is a multi-dimensional concept that relates to the preparation of educated citizens  to  contribute  to  their  professions  and  to  society  in  general (Sullivan, 1988) in the age of AI (Yi, 2021). Despite the importance of promoting  AI  literacy  as  universally  as  possible  (Long &amp; Magerko, 2020), most AI literacy education initiatives target computer science students  in  higher  education  and  do  not  adequately  emphasise  the application of AI to diverse real-life problems (Kong, Cheung, &amp; Tsang, 2022; Ng et al., 2023). This study extended the teaching of AI literacy to senior secondary students as part of the greater goal of promoting AI literacy among all educated citizens.

## 2. Background of Study

## 2.1. The four dimensions of AI literacy

As discussed in the ' Introduction ' section, AI literacy is essential to enable educated citizens to harness AI and use it to contribute to society. The elements of AI literacy can be grouped into four dimensions. At the most fundamental level, educated citizens must have an adequate conceptual understanding of AI (Touretzky et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2023; Wong et al., 2020). Across nearly all the proposals of what constitutes AI literacy, knowledge and concepts of AI are consistently identified as a crucial component. One of the earliest AI literacy frameworks (AILFs) was developed by Long and Magerko (2020), who stressed the importance  of  knowing  what  AI  algorithms  can  do  and  how  they  can  be applied. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development [OECD] (2021) deemed an understanding of AI concepts as central to educated citizens ' ability to evaluate and engage with AI. More recently, Ng  et  al.  (2022)  noted  that  AI  concepts  without  any  prerequisite knowledge comprise the most fundamental level of AI literacy, enabling educated citizens to comprehend the principles of AI rather than simply using its applications. Additionally, many AILFs place a strong emphasis on conceptual understanding of AI, as opposed to generating novel AI algorithms.

The cognitive dimension of AI literacy relates to the understanding of AI  concepts,  including  the  underlying  logic  of  AI  algorithms  such  as supervised learning (e.g. linear regression and the K-nearest neighbour algorithm),  unsupervised  learning  (such  as  K-means  clustering),  and neural networks, and how these algorithms can be adapted as solutions to real-life problems (Chiu et al., 2022; Marques et al., 2020; Ng et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2023). Conceptual understanding is the foundation on  which  educated  citizens  apply  AI  in  everyday  life,  evaluate  their perceptions of and feelings about AI, and advance their AI knowledge and  competence.  The  focus  of  conceptual  understanding  is  on  the knowledge and skills needed to use and apply AI models, which are AI algorithm-based mathematical models trained on vast amounts of data to perform specific tasks; students do not need to comprehend complex mathematical  formulae  or  write  programming  code  to  apply  such models. Teaching AI concepts also lowers the barriers of entry to AI literacy (Kong, Cheung, &amp; Zhang, 2022; Long &amp; Magerko, 2020) and enables  its  promotion  to  as  many  educated  citizens  as  possible,  preparing them for the AI revolution (Chaka, 2023). There is a need to improve educated citizens ' ability to leverage publicly available AI tools and generate solutions to problems they encounter at work or in their daily  lives.  The  goal  is  to  allow  educated  citizens  to  partner  and collaborate with AI, becoming active participants in the AI world instead of  mere  passive  consumers.  Indeed,  recent  studies  have  increasingly focused on the teaching of AI to non-computer science or non-mathematics  experts  who  nonetheless  regularly  engage  with  AI (Laupichler  et  al.,  2023).  Our  previous  research  (Kong  et  al.,  2021, 2022a) confirmed that in both university and senior secondary student populations, programming is not a prerequisite for the acquisition of AI concepts. However, students do require a knowledge of basic mathematical concepts, such  as mean,  standard  deviation, slope,  and Euclidean distance, to grasp the rationale of AI algorithms.

The conceptual understanding of AI also encompasses the strengths and  limitations  of  algorithms,  along  with  the  types  of  problems  for which they may be applicable and suitable (Ng et al., 2023; Pintrich, 2002). Educated citizens need this knowledge to readily apply AI to augment their skillsets, advance their productivity and creativity, and solve  real-life  problems.  AI  concepts  are  also  valuable,  if  not  indispensable,  in  evaluating  AI-based  solutions  formulated  by  oneself  or others, which is a key step in problem-solving using AI.

Concepts alone are not enough to fully harness AI; educated citizens also need to solve diverse problems that go beyond conceptual understanding (Ng et al., 2023) and involve metacognitive processes. Thus, the  capacity  to  apply  AI  tools  for  problem-solving  makes  up  the metacognitive dimension of AI literacy. Adapting the model proposed by Schraw et al. (2006), problem-solving using AI can be summarised as consisting of the following four stages: (1) defining the problem; (2) identifying relevant AI concepts and solutions; (3) selecting, planning, and executing the AI-based solutions; and (4) evaluating the results of the solutions.

When solving problems with AI, educated citizens need to be acutely aware of the AI concepts they are familiar with, retrieve those concepts, and  then  consider  and  select  the  concepts  relevant  to  their  specific problems (Torrey, 2012). These concepts range from the capabilities and weaknesses of algorithms to the way these algorithms can be implemented as solutions. Notably, citizens must know how to collect and process suitable data (Whang et al., 2023), and must understand how to select an existing AI algorithm or model suitable for the problem. After executing the selected model as an AI-based solution, educated citizens need to interpret and evaluate the results. If the solution leads to unexpected outcomes, the AI problem-solving process must be repeated to either modify the current solution or devise a novel solution (Schraw et  al.,  2006).  Importantly,  improving  the  solution  requires  educated citizens to be conscious of the limitations of their understanding of AI concepts.  By  further  strengthening  their  conceptual  understanding, educated citizens can formulate novel strategies and self-enhance their problem-solving competence, which is a core feature of metacognition (Winne &amp; Azevedo, 2014).

Often  overlooked  but  of  equal  importance  to  AI  concepts  and  AI problem-solving skills is educated citizens ' psychological readiness to interact  with  AI,  which  forms  the  affective  dimension  of  AI  literacy. Psychological readiness is required for educated citizens to proactively use  AI  as  a  tool  to  solve  real-life  problems,  and  to  fully  harness  AI technology to contribute to their professions and to society (Chiu et al., 2022; Dai et al., 2020). As a central element of readiness, empowerment increases educated citizens ' confidence in applying AI for problem-solving (Kong et al., 2021). Empowerment can be subclassified into four components, two of which are especially critical to problem-solving with AI. In the context of problem-solving, 'AI self-efficacy ' refers  to  educated  citizens ' confidence  in  successfully  harnessing AI to solve real-life problems (Bandura, 1982). AI self-efficacy is closely related to educated citizens ' sense of capability, as the feeling of being able to solve problems with AI increases their self-efficacy (Chai et al., 2021). Another empowerment factor key to AI problem-solving is educated citizens ' creative self-efficacy, which is the self-belief in their creativity (Tierney &amp; Farmer, 2011). As described above, the formulation of novel ideas is a major feature of the problem-solving process, particularly when a previous solution has failed. Thus, the ability to produce new AI-based solutions, which frequently require creative or divergent thinking, is integral to successful AI problem-solving. Multiple studies have shown a reciprocal positive association between creative self-efficacy  and  creativity  (Puente-Díaz &amp; Cavazos-Arroyo,  2017; Tierney &amp; Farmer, 2011). Notably, Royston and Reiter-Palmon (2019) reported the pivotal role of creative self-efficacy in mediating students ' creativity and their creative thinking in problem-solving.

The remaining two factors of empowerment -meaningfulness and impact -motivate educated citizens to interact with and harness AI. In the AI context, 'meaningfulness ' refers to educated citizens ' perception of the personal significance of using AI for problem-solving (Thomas &amp; Velthouse, 1990), while 'impact ' refers to their view of  how problem-solving  with  AI  can  affect  society  (Frymier  et  al.,  1996). Educated citizens need to realise the value and power of applying AI to their everyday lives if they are to be internally motivated to use AI to solve challenges (Lin et al., 2021). It has  been  proposed that student-centred,  self-directed  course  designs,  such  as  project-based learning (PBL), are conducive to empowering learners (Hains &amp; Smith, 2012). Self-directed projects allow students to select personally meaningful problems and experience how AI can be used to solve them. A personal and active learning experience empowers learners to use AI for problem-solving,  conferring  upon  them  a  sense  of  capability  and

GLYPH&lt;0&gt;,

achievement,  and  helping  them  recognise  the  importance  of  solving problems with AI (Dede &amp; Barab, 2009).

The last dimension of AI literacy, the social dimension, relates to how educated citizens can contribute to society by using AI to solve problems (Long &amp; Magerko, 2020; Ng et al., 2023; Touretzky et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2023). AI usage inevitably has both favourable and adverse impacts, and educated citizens must appropriately balance these effects. When applying AI to problem-solving, they must consider the ethical concerns associated with AI-based solutions and their implementation (Chiu et al., 2022; Kong et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023; Wong et al., 2020). They also need to decide whether AI is truly needed to solve a specific problem (Sturm et al., 2021). Recent AI ethical guidelines have emphasised  various  ethical  principles  (European  Commission,  2022; White House Office of Science and Technology Policy [OSTP], 2022; United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO,  2022),  the  three  most  important  of  which  are  fairness, beneficence,  and  human  autonomy  (Kong  et  al.,  2023).  Collectively, these principles dictate that the benefits and risks of AI-based solutions must be distributed evenly, with the former outweighing the latter, and human users should ultimately be accountable for the effects of AI-based solutions.  These  AI  ethical  principles,  which  have  recently  received intense scholarly attention (Jobin et al., 2019; Kaur et al., 2023; Vinuesa et  al.,  2020),  may  be  regarded as constraints within which educated citizens  solve  real-life  problems  with  AI  (Floridi  et  al.,  2020).  Fig.  1 shows the four dimensions of our proposed AILF and its main content. The four dimensions are cognitive, metacognitive, affective, and social.

## 2.2. Project-based learning in AI education programmes

PBL is a pedagogical approach in which students create a product (Prince &amp; Felder,  2007).  PBL  has  characteristics  typical  of  situated learning, including collaboration, real-world contexts, and self-reflection (Herrington &amp; Oliver, 2000). In practice, Ng et al. (2023) discovered that more than 60% of AI education programmes adopted a collaborative PBL design. PBL begins with a driving problem to be solved (Krajcik &amp; Shin, 2014), around which learners set goals (Kokotsaki et al., 2016) and approach the problem creatively and critically from multiple perspectives (Karan &amp; Brown, 2022). PBL also allows learners to apply theoretical  ideas  in  a  hands-on  manner,  transforming  concepts  into concrete solutions (Tomlin et al., 2019) and, in the process, becoming more confident and empowered (Tsybulsky &amp; Muchnik-Rozanov, 2019). PBL  therefore  also  corresponds  to  the  ultimate  stage  of  the  revised Bloom ' s taxonomy, namely, to create (Anderson &amp; Krathwohl, 2001). Students who create their own AI-based solutions to a self-identified problem will, in the process, develop their ability to use AI to solve problems as well as their confidence in using AI in real-life scenarios. Compared with traditional instruction, PBL results in better awareness of the value of the subject, self-perceived competence, self-efficacy, and career aspirations (Beier et al., 2018).

## 2.3. The research gap

The four dimensions of AI literacy discussed above are collectively required for educated citizens to harness AI and contribute to society. There is, to the best of our knowledge, no comprehensive framework of AI  literacy  in  the  literature.  While  previous  studies  have  proposed several AILFs, they each emphasise a different set of core components of AI literacy. For example, early AILFs (Long &amp; Magerko, 2020; Touretzky et al., 2019; Wong et al., 2020) focused on the cognitive and social dimensions, highlighting AI concepts and the ethical use of AI. The AILFs developed in other studies (Chiu et al., 2022; Dai et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2023) included citizens ' confidence in engaging and readiness to engage with AI and their perception of the relevance of AI, recognising the affective dimension as an integral constituent of AI literacy. However, few AILFs emphasise the use of AI for problem-solving, the metacognitive dimension in our AILF. The AILF developed by Ng et al. (2022) is one of the few to recognise that AI literacy involves the application of AI concepts to solve problems in real-life situations.

We propose a comprehensive four-dimensional AILF for senior secondary students. We applied a mixed-methods analysis to answer the following research questions: (1) Can PBL help senior secondary students develop their conceptual understanding of AI? (2) How can senior secondary students ' ability to solve problems using AI be developed? (3) Can senior secondary students be empowered to use AI to solve problems? (4) Can senior secondary students develop ethical concepts and understand the relevant ethical principles when solving problems with AI?

## 3. Methodology

## 3.1. Course participants

This study is part of an AI literacy project in a university in Hong Kong, following a donation in support of a programme that publicly recruited students from all secondary schools in Hong Kong to develop their AI literacy. The AI literacy course reported in this study is the third part of the AI literacy programme. The first two parts were two 9-h courses on AI concepts in machine learning and deep learning (Kong, Cheung, &amp; Tsang, 2022), totalling 18 h. Those two courses also covered the  five  steps  of  machine  learning,  which  serve  as  a  guideline  for

GLYPH&lt;0&gt;,

problem-solving using AI. The five steps are (1) problem definition; (2) data  collection;  (3)  data  pre-processing;  (4)  model  training;  and  (5) inference  and  prediction.  Participation  was  entirely  voluntary,  and participants could opt out at any time during the programme. We obtained  informed  consent  from  all  participants  of  this  study.  Ethical approval  to  collect  data  in  this  study  was  granted  by  the  Human Research Ethics Committee of the university (Ref. No. A2020-2021-0204 and 2021-2022-0325).

One hundred and twenty-eight senior secondary students completed the first two courses, and then proceeded to the third course, which is reported here. Regarding data collection for this study, all 128 students completed  the  AI  conceptual  test  and  the  four  surveys  administered during the study. Additionally, 97 students contributed self-reflective essays, and 12 students joined focus group interviews. Over half of the students reported a lack of a programming background, as the course did not require any knowledge of programming. The demographics of the students are detailed in Table 1.

## 3.2. Course administration and design

The whole programme was non-credit-bearing and free of charge. The students were openly recruited from all secondary schools in Hong Kong. They received a certificate of completion after completing each course. The instructors of the course were all well qualified academically, having either a doctoral degree, master ' s degree, or postgraduate diploma in education.

The entire course consisted of workshops that lasted for a total of 14 h. It adopted a PBL pedagogical approach. Ethical principles and considerations around the usage of AI, with a focus on the beneficence of AI, fairness of AI, and human autonomy, were first introduced to the participants, who then conducted an AI problem-solving project in groups. They first brainstormed a problem that could be solved with AI-enabled tools, and the instructors then demonstrated the use of AI-enabled tools such  as  Google  Teachable  Machine  (for  image,  sound,  and  posture recognition), Microsoft Azure QnA Maker (for chatbot generation), and Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio (for quantitative data analysis and prediction). As these tools were either freely available or institutionally  subscribed  to,  the  participants  could  readily  access  and  use them. The instructors then organised project consultations for individual groups.  The  five  steps  of  machine  learning  were  reiterated  and emphasised, as the participants were asked to follow these steps as a guideline when designing the AI-based solutions. An example of an AIbased  solution  that  the  participants  developed  was  an  AI  squatting coach, which discerned whether users ' squatting posture was correct. The instructors indicated that the most frequently used mode of Google Teachable Machine, the image recognition mode, may not be optimal, and suggested the posture mode instead. They also offered suggestions on how to collect postural data, such as through the online dataset portal Kaggle or by taking pictures. Furthermore, the instructors guided the participants  in  considering  the  ethical  implications  of  their  AI-based solutions and how those concerns could be mitigated. The participants then  engaged  in  approximately  6  h  of  collaborative  project  work  in which they produced AI-based solutions to their self-defined problems. They collected data and trained their AI models to generate a solution, in the process reflecting on the challenges, potential enhancements, and

ethical  considerations  pertaining  to  their  AI-based  solutions.  Next, during project presentation, the students demonstrated these solutions, discussed the associated ethical issues and considerations, reflected on the challenges encountered throughout the problem-solving project, and proposed potential enhancements to the solutions. The students were expected to discuss ethical implications not limited solely to the final solution product but also related to data collection, data processing, and other stages of the overall AI problem-solving project. Table 2 shows how  the  course  design  was  aligned  with  the  four  dimensions  of  AI literacy.

## 3.3. Instruments

Both quantitative and qualitative instruments were used for course evaluation.  The  quantitative  instruments  were  as  follows:  (1)  an  'AI Concepts for Problem-solving ' test consisting of seven questions to assess the participants ' ability to use AI concepts to solve real-life problems; (2) a 'Metacognitive Strategies for Problem-solving in PBL ' survey with four items to measure how the collaborative project affected the participants ' metacognition when solving problems with AI; (3) an 'Empowerment in Using  AI  for  Problem-solving  survey ' with  17  items  to  measure  the participants ' degree of empowerment in using AI for problem-solving; (4) an 'AI Ethics ' survey with 12 items to assess the participants ' understanding of AI ethical principles and issues (Kong, Cheung, &amp; Tsang, 2022); Kong, Cheung, &amp; Zhang, 2022nd (5) a 'Literacy in Using AI for Problem-solving ' survey  with  12  items  to  evaluate  the  participants ' perceptions of their competence in using AI for problem-solving. The qualitative instruments were as follows: (1) focus group interviews that included an in-depth discussion of the participants ' learning from the course; and (2) a self-reflective essay on AI in English or Chinese.

The instruments were developed based on the four dimensions of AI literacy.  The  'AI  Concepts  for  Problem-solving ' test  was  designed  to measure the capability of the students in applying the machine learning and deep learning concepts that they had acquired in the 18-h foundation course to real-life scenarios. An excerpt from the 'AI Concepts for Problem-solving ' test can be found in Appendix 1. The 'Metacognitive Strategies for Problem-solving in PBL ' survey was designed to measure

the  students ' metacognition  and  ability  to  think  when  using  AI  for problem-solving, in line with the metacognitive dimension of AI literacy. This includes recalling AI concepts, evaluating potential AI-based strategies,  judging  and  making  decisions  on  the  solution  to  be  used, and self-reflecting on any limitations in one ' s understanding of AI concepts and ways to self-improve one ' s understanding of AI and problemsolving ability. All items of the 'Metacognitive Strategies for Problemsolving in PBL ' survey can be found in Table 5. The 'Empowerment in Using AI for Problem-solving survey ' was designed to study the students ' empowerment and psychological readiness to apply AI technology for problem-solving and contains items on the four factors of empowerment defined in the 'Background of Study ' section, namely impact, creative self-efficacy,  AI  self-efficacy,  and  meaningfulness.  These  four components were covered by four, four, five, and four items, respectively. An excerpt from the AI Empowerment for Problem-solving survey can be found in Appendix 2. The 'AI Ethics ' survey was used to evaluate the students ' understanding  of  ethical  principles  when  solving  problems with AI. It comprised questions on the three major AI ethical principles described in the 'Background of Study ' section, namely human autonomy, beneficence of AI, and fairness of AI. Each of the principles was covered by four items. An excerpt from the 'AI Ethics ' survey can be found in Appendix 3. The 'Literacy in Using AI for Problem-solving ' survey was designed to assess the students ' overall self-perception of their ability to solve problems with AI. All items of the Literacy in Using AI for Problem-solving ' survey can be found in Table 8.

All items of the surveys consisted of single statements designed to measure the attitudes of the participants. Each statement was answered by selecting responses from an evenly spaced Likert scale, ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) to measure the participants ' level  of  agreement/disagreement  with  the  target  statement  (Likert, 1932). Table 3 shows the results of normality and reliability tests for the five quantitative instruments. The Kolmogorov -Smirnov test was used to test for normality of the data, and it showed the score distributions of all  five  instruments significantly deviated from a normal distribution (see Table 3), justifying the use of non-parametric statistical analyses. The reliability of the instruments was assessed using Cronbach ' s alpha, a measure of consistency, i.e. the degree to which the items in an instrument measure the same feature. The greater the value of Cronbach ' s alpha, the more consistent the items in an instrument, and the more reliable that instrument (Tavako &amp; Dennick, 2011). All but one survey had a Cronbach ' s alpha over 0.95, which the literature has suggested to be an ideal value (Tavako &amp; Dennick, 2011).

The focus group interviews were guided by five questions covering the cognitive, metacognitive, affective, and social aspects of AI literacy. The students were asked about the specific AI concepts they had learnt from the course and how the course had prepared them to apply AI in their daily lives and in their future endeavours of study or work. They

were also interviewed on the influence of the problem-solving project on their feelings towards learning about and using AI. Lastly, the students were asked for their views on the impact of AI on future society. An excerpt  from  the  focus  group  interview  questions,  which  were  semistructured,  can  be  found  in  Appendix  4.  The  self-reflective  essay  instrument, in which the students wrote about AI in English or Chinese, was designed to be less structured. There was no specific topic or guiding question, and the students were free to express their views, including what they knew about AI, how they may harness AI, and how AI may affect society.

As  the  qualitative  component  of  our  mixed-methods  analysis,  we conducted thematic analysis, which is widely used to analyse qualitative data (Braun &amp; Clarke, 2006). Data from both qualitative instruments were used, namely the transcripts of the focus group interview with 12 of the participants and the post-course self-reflective essays written by 97 participants. The use of multiple data sources for thematic analysis is recommended, as it allows for a better-supported, more robust conclusion than single-source thematic analysis (Creswell &amp; Poth, 2017; Peel, 2020; Xu &amp; Zammit, 2020), and it has been adopted in recent studies (Araújo  et  al.,  2017;  El-Jardali  et  al.,  2014;  Stott  et  al.,  2018).  The analysis was performed following the procedure described in Braun and Clarke (2006), pursuant to which we (1) read through the interview transcripts and reflective essays to familiarise ourselves with the data; (2)  generated  initial  open  codes;  (3)  identified  the  patterns  and  categorised the codes into axial codes; (4) developed the themes; and (5) established the relationships between the themes. More specifically, we selected words and phrases that were frequently repeated in the transcripts and reflective essays to derive the initial open codes. These open codes were then classified into axial codes based on their underlying meanings. Lastly, the axial codes were grouped into high-level themes and were named such that they captured the meanings of all  corresponding codes. We also derived relationships between the themes and codes from the source materials.

## 4. Results and discussion

This section reports the changes in the participants ' ability to apply AI concepts for problem-solving, their metacognitive strategies when solving problems with AI under the PBL approach, their empowerment in  using  AI  for  problem-solving,  their  understanding  of  ethics  when using AI for problem-solving, and their literacy in using AI for problemsolving.

## 4.1. Using AI concepts for problem-solving

Table 4 shows the students ' mean scores and standard deviations in the 'AI Concepts for Problem-solving ' test before and after our AI literacy  course.  Because  the  scores  were  not  normally  distributed  (see Table 3), statistical significance was measured using the non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test.

The participants ' scores in the 'AI Concepts for Problem-solving ' test significantly improved after the course. Importantly, these test questions on the 'AI Concepts for Problem-solving ' test focused on real-life scenarios and the application of machine learning and deep learning concepts to those scenarios (see Appendix 1). The result of this test indicated that, because the participants had already learnt about machine learning

and deep learning concepts in prior foundational courses, the result of this test indicated that they were able to apply the AI concepts acquired after putting the concepts into practice for solving problems.

## 4.2. Enhancing Metacognitive Strategies for Problem-solving through project-based learning

Our AI literacy course adopted the PBL approach. Table 5 reports the evaluation of the effectiveness of this teaching approach in enhancing the participants ' metacognitive strategies, as perceived by the students. Both individual survey items and the overall results showed that the students felt that PBL had significantly improved their metacognitive strategies for solving problems using AI. PBL allowed them to review the relevant AI concepts, recall these concepts when selecting and assessing AI-based strategies, decide on the solution to be used, and consider novel or  alternative  solutions.  Echoing  the  students ' perception  of  their enhanced ability to self-improve, we found that PBL had also helped the participants evaluate their problem-solving performance and self-reflect on their own shortfalls in the understanding of AI concepts, enabling them to strengthen their conceptual understanding of AI and problemsolving ability. This provides evidence that PBL is an effective pedagogical approach to developing senior secondary students ' competence in problem-solving using AI, including following the necessary metacognitive strategies.

## 4.3. Fostering empowerment in problem-solving with AI

Table  6  summarises  the  participants ' responses  to  the  survey  on 'Empowerment in Using AI for Problem-solving ' before and after the AI literacy course. Both the overall survey scores and the scores for the individual components of AI empowerment (see 'Background of Study ' ) are reported.

The overall results indicate that the participants ' AI empowerment level significantly increased after taking our AI literacy course. Grouping the  survey  items  into  the  four  components  of  AI  empowerment,  we found that the course helped the students achieve significantly higher levels of AI self-efficacy and creative self-efficacy, which are required to confidently apply AI to solve problems and formulate novel AI-based solutions,  respectively.  After  taking  the  course,  the  students  also

perceived problem-solving using AI as more meaningful, which can be expected to motivate them to start to apply and continue employing AI in challenges they face in the future. Although there was no significant change in their perception of the impact of problem-solving using AI, the high  pre-course  score  suggests  that  the  participants  recognised  its impact before attending our course. It is likely that the ceiling effect prevented a significant further increase (Lee et al., 2021).

## 4.4. Awareness and comprehension of AI ethics

Table 7 shows the descriptive statistics and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test results of the 'AI Ethics ' survey before and after the course. The results  indicate  that  the  course  significantly  enhanced  the  students ' comprehension of AI ethics ( Mdiff = 0.09, Z = GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 2.73, p &lt; 0.01).

Our previous study found evidence that abstract AI ethical principles were more challenging for senior secondary students than for university students, as the former group failed to significantly improve in the 'AI Ethics ' survey despite an obvious improvement in their awareness of the ethical  issues  around  AI  (Kong,  Cheung, &amp; Tsang, 2022). For the AI literacy course reported in the present study, we modified the teaching method and evaluated the effectiveness of our new approach in helping the students understand AI ethical principles. Throughout the problem-solving project, the instructors  more closely  guided  the  students during the project consultations than they had in the previous study. In particular, the instructors challenged the students to reflect on and conceptualise the ethical implications of their AI-based solutions. They also helped the students draw connections from ethical principles to the AI-based solutions that they conceived. Despite the participants ' relatively high pre-course scores, our modified approach further developed their awareness and understanding of the ethical considerations related to AI. Our course, using PBL and enhanced advice from the instructors,  allowed  the  participants  to  deliberate  on  ethical  considerations  and  reflect  on  relevant  ethical  principles.  Thus,  the  teaching approaches adopted in our course helped the students grasp the ethical concepts  that  constrained  the  selection  and  implementation  of  their AI-based solutions and so were central to the students ' solution of their self-defined problems using AI.

'Literacy in Using AI for Problem-solving ' . Statistical analysis was carried  out  for  each  survey  item  and  for  the  overall  result.  The  survey measured the students ' ability to solve problems with AI, and tracked the change in their ability to use AI for problem-solving before and after learning in the project-based AI literacy course.

Overall, the participants experienced a significant improvement in their competence in using AI to solve problems. Comparing survey items 1 -4  before  and  after  our  course,  the  students  were  better  at  solving diverse problems, including problems involving images, sound, text, and a combination thereof. The significant increase in the scores for survey items 5 -8 indicates that they also became more adept at executing the various steps of AI problem-solving, from collecting data for training AI models, to selecting optimal algorithms, and to interpreting and evaluating the output of AI-based solutions. Notably, through survey items 5 -8, we found that the students had learnt how to self-improve their AI problem-solving skills,  demonstrating enhanced metacognitive strategies. As noted in the ' Introduction ' section, AI literacy is required for educated citizens to solve problems of various levels of difficulty using AI  and  to  contribute  to  their  professions  and  to  society.  Thus,  by improving  the  students ' metacognitive  strategies,  our  course  helped them continue contributing and participating in the AI society even as AI

technology keeps evolving.

## 4.6. Thematic analysis results

As  listed  in  Table  9,  the  following  four  themes  were  identified: conceptual understanding of AI, using AI for problem-solving, empowerment  to  use  AI,  and  ethical  considerations  of  AI.  Overall,  ethical considerations related to AI were the theme covered in the largest percentage of coded instances (31.64%), indicating a strong focus on this area. Many participants indicated that our AI literacy course had helped them understand the importance of reviewing concepts when solving problems using AI in their projects. Selected projects and students ' reflections  on  those  projects  are  described  in  Table  10.  Central  to  the process of problem-solving with AI is the review of previously acquired AI concepts, including what algorithms are available and which algorithms should be applied in which situations. The participants had to retrieve their knowledge and reflect on the adequacy of their current knowledge (Pintrich, 2002). In the interviews and self-reflective writing, the students most often cited the problem-solving stage of data selection, and they stated that the course had helped them recognise the criteria for retaining or disposing of data. They had to appropriately collect, choose,  and  process  the  relevant  data  to  serve  as  input  for  training problem-specific AI models (Roh et al., 2019). One of the criteria that the  participants  reiterated  in  their  self-reflections  was  the  ethical collection of data, meaning that they had to consider issues concerning privacy, intellectual property, and discrimination and bias.

The  participants  also  mentioned  executing  problem-solving  steps that involved metacognitive processes, including model evaluation and model improvement. The participants  had  to  interpret  the  results  of their  AI-based  solutions  and  re-initiate  the  problem-solving  process when necessary. The results of the thematic analysis highlighted the instrumental  role  played  by  PBL  in  developing  the  students ' metacognitive strategies and building their skills to solve problems using AI.

The  students  also  credited  PBL  for  sparking  their  interest  in  AI, including  using  the  technology  for  problem-solving,  as  the  project allowed them to solve personally and socially significant problems. They also  stated  that  completing  the  project  had  given  them  a  feeling  of capability and increased their confidence in applying AI to everyday problems, all of which had increased the participants ' level of empowerment to harness AI to solve problems. The students further specified that PBL had allowed them to apply their knowledge of AI applications and algorithms in a hands-on manner and to engage in increased peer

The thematic analysis provided further support for the use of PBL pedagogy to develop senior secondary students ' skills  in  using  AI  to solve problems. It also reinforced the quantitative finding that problemsolving projects are an effective way to empower senior secondary students and nurture their confidence in applying AI to future challenges. Specifically, the projects offered the students opportunities to apply AI concepts in a hands-on manner and personally observe the process and output of using AI to solve real-life problems. However, 'empowerment to use AI ' was the theme with the fewest coded instances, making up only 16.38% of the total. Cultural factors may influence the way students  express  their  confidence  and  engage  in  learning  activities.  In Asian, especially Confucian, cultures, humility and modesty are highly valued,  and  overt  displays  of  confidence  are  sometimes  viewed  as inappropriate or boastful (Leung &amp; Cohen, 2011; Markus &amp; Kitayama, 1991). This cultural norm may influence how the students ' discussed empowerment in interviews and self-reflective essays (Lu et al., 2022).

## 5. Conclusion, implications, limitations, and future studies

This study evaluated an AI literacy course designed to endow senior secondary  students  with  the  knowledge  and  skills  to  solve  real-life problems using AI. The course adopted a PBL pedagogical approach in which  students,  guided  by  instructors,  developed  AI  applications  to solve self-defined problems. Both the quantitative and qualitative results indicated that the students ' competence in using AI to solve problems had increased, as had their confidence and readiness to do so.

As the students already possessed conceptual knowledge of machine learning and deep learning, our course ' s PBL approach offered them the opportunity to put these concepts into practice (Tomlin et al., 2019). The results of the 'AI Concepts for Problem-solving ' test implied that PBL had improved the students ' understanding of the AI concepts that they had to review when formulating an AI-based solution in the problem-solving project. The 'Metacognitive Strategies for Problem-solving in PBL ' survey and 'Literacy in Using AI for Problem-solving ' survey also indicated that PBL had helped the students build their problem-solving competence. After the course, the senior secondary students were not only capable of solving diverse problems but also better able to engage in processes requiring metacognitive strategies, such  as  self-improving  their  problem-solving  skills,  evaluating  and formulating  novel  solutions,  and  recalling  and  applying  relevant  AI knowledge.  These  results  suggest  that  PBL  is  a  suitable  pedagogical approach to fostering students ' conceptual understanding of AI and to further developing their competence in using AI for problem-solving.

Our AI literacy course also empowered the senior secondary students to apply AI to solve real-life problems. The significant improvement in their AI self-efficacy and creative self-efficacy components showed that after the course, the students had increased confidence in their ability to use and creativity in using AI for problem-solving and were readier to do so than they were before the course. This result is consistent with recent studies that have evaluated PBL-based AI courses (Bühler et al., 2022; Williams et al., 2023; Xia et al., 2022; Zhan et al., 2022). PBL allowed the students to apply AI concepts in a hands-on manner, promoting their interest in applying AI to solve problems, not merely knowing about the technology. Successful completion of the project also conferred upon the students a sense of capability in harnessing AI to solve problems. PBL ' s enhancement of the students ' creative self-efficacy is a notable finding, as improving and devising alternative AI-based solutions requires creative thinking and self-belief in creativity. The ceiling effect may explain the nonsignificant enhancement of the participants ' perceptions of the impact  and  meaningfulness  of  problem-solving  with  AI  (Lee  et  al., 2021). Before the course, the students already had a noticeable awareness of the power and value of using AI for problem-solving.

In a previous study (Kong, Cheung, &amp; Tsang, 2022), we argued that senior  secondary  students  required  increased  guidance  and  time  to develop their comprehension of abstract AI ethical principles, as this proved more challenging to them than to university students. Thus, the instructors  in  the  present  AI  literacy  course  modified  their  teaching methods accordingly. This revised pedagogical approach significantly improved the participating senior secondary students ' understanding of ethical principles and  their consideration  of ethical issues. This enhanced  ethical  awareness  and  comprehension,  which  enables  the participating students to understand the constraints within which they can apply AI, is crucial for AI-based problem solving.

In summary, this study has two important implications, one theoretical and the other practical. First, this study provided an initial substantiated theoretical framework for guiding the design of AI literacy programmes. This study provided groundwork and justification for a comprehensive four-dimensional AILF, comprising cognitive (conceptual understanding of AI), metacognitive (the ability to solve problems with AI),  affective  (psychological  readiness  to  apply  AI  for  problemsolving),  and  social  (ethical  considerations  of  AI-based  solutions)  dimensions. This framework may serve as a guide for the design of future AI literacy education programmes. The framework acknowledges that personally meaningful experiences are essential for the development of students ' AI literacy, such as through student-centred problem-solving projects. This is corroborated by the findings of this study, in which the AI problem-solving project enabled students to apply the AI concepts they had acquired, realise their ability to use AI, understand the benefits of AI application in real-world scenarios, and reflect on the ethical implications of the AI-based solutions they had developed. Second, this study  provided  empirical  evidence  that  PBL  is  a  viable  teaching approach for developing the AI literacy of senior secondary students. PBL was shown to strengthen senior secondary students ' understanding of AI concepts, develop their confidence, and psychologically empower them to apply AI for solving problems they encounter in study, work, or their daily lives. The study also confirmed that senior secondary students require more guidance to fully understand the ethical principles and issues surrounding AI.

The study also has two limitations. First, there is a need to broaden the database of participants. Having a greater number of students study the AI literacy course would enable us to further substantiate the results obtained in this study. Additionally, the geographical homogeneity of the participants may have affected the generalisability of the results. As such,  future  research  could  benefit  from  including  students  across different geographical regions, thereby ensuring broader applicability of

GLYPH&lt;0&gt;,

the  findings.  The  second  limitation  concerns  instrument  validation, which  was  potentially  limited  in  scope  in  this  study.  To  ensure  the reliability and validity of the instruments, future studies should consider validating them among a more extensive and diverse population. This would help confirm the effectiveness of the instruments across a wider context and populace, thereby enhancing the robustness of our research conclusions.

As discussed in the ' Introduction ' section, with the increasing role of AI in society, educated citizens need to be literate in AI to harness this technology and work synergistically with it. By partnering with AI and being augmented by this partnership, educated citizens can apply AI to solve real-life problems and contribute to society. We verified that our AI literacy course equipped senior secondary students with a knowledge of essential AI concepts, developed their AI problem-solving competence and ethical understanding, and empowered them to apply AI to solve real-life  problems.  Students  with  such  skills  are  prepared  for  an  AI future, being able to proactively harness AI and shape society ' s future response to the AI revolution. Future studies should investigate whether and  how  our  AI  literacy  course  can  prepare  educated  citizens  to participate in determining and shaping the direction in which society will move in the AI age.
