## Title

DigComp 2.1: The Digital Competence Framework for Citizens with eight proficiency levels and examples of use

## Abstract

DigComp 2.1 is a further development of the Digital Competence Framework for Citizens. Based on the reference conceptual model published in DigComp 2.0, we present now eight proficiency levels and examples of use applied to the learning and employment field.

## Preface

JRC research on Learning and Skills for the Digital Era started in 2005 with the aim to provide evidence-based policy support to the European Commission and the Member States on harnessing the potential of digital technologies to innovate education and training practices, improve access to lifelong learning and to deal with the rise of new (digital)  skills  and  competences  needed  for  employment,  personal  development  and social inclusion. More than 20 major studies have been undertaken on these issues with more than 100 different publications.

The European Digital Competence Framework for Citizens 1 ,  also  known  as  DigComp, offers a tool to improve citizens' digital competence. DigComp was developed by the JRC as a scientific project and with intensive consultation of stakeholders, initially on behalf of DG EAC and, more recently, on behalf of DG EMPL. First published in 2013, DigComp has become a reference for the development and strategic planning of digital competence initiatives both at European and Member State level. In June 2016 JRC published DigComp 2.0, updating the terminology and conceptual model, as well as showcasing examples of its implementation at the European, national and regional level.

The current version is labelled DigComp 2.1 and it focuses on expanding the initial three proficiency levels to a more fine-grained eight level description as well as providing ex -amples of use for these eight levels. Its aim is to support stakeholders with the further implementation of DigComp.

Other related JRC works on capacity building for the digital transformation of education and learning and for changing requirements on skills and competences has focussed on the development of:

- digital competence frameworks for educators (DigCompEdu),
- educational organisations ( DigCompOrg ),
- consumers (DigCompConsumers).

A framework for opening-up Higher Education Institutions (

OpenEdu

) was also published in 2016, as well as a competence framework for entrepreneurship (EntreComp). Some

of  these  frameworks  are  accompanied  by  (self-)assessment  instruments.  Additional research has been undertaken on computational thinking (CompuThink),

lytics

Learning Ana

, MOOC learners (MOOCKnowledge) and  MOOCs and free digital learning opportu nities for migrants and refugees (

MOOCs4inclusion

).

## Introduction Section 1

The report presents the latest version of the Digital Competence Framework for Citizens (DigComp) 2   which was elaborated by the Human Capital and Employment Unit (Joint Research Centre) on behalf of the Directorate General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion of the European Commission.

The DigComp Framework has 5 dimensions:

| Dimension 1:   | Competence areas identified to be part of digital competence                  |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Dimension 2:   | Competence descriptors and titles that are pertinent to each area             |
| Dimension 3:   | Proficiency levels for each competence                                        |
| Dimension 4:   | Knowledge, skills and attitudes applicable to each competence                 |
| Dimension 5:   | Examples of use, on the applicability of the competence to different purposes |

Two of the dimensions in the earliest version of the Framework (DigComp 1.0 pub -lished in 2013) were updated in 2016, namely Dimension 1 (the competence areas) and Dimension 2 (the descriptors and titles). The updated version became DigComp 2.0 3 . This report presents the latest version of the Framework - DigComp 2.1 - which includes further updates. Dimension 3 now has eight proficiency levels and Dimension 5 has new examples of use 4 .

Section 2 of this report explains the eight proficiency levels and describes the examples of use.  Section 3 presents the new Framework in detail. Significant effort has been dedi -cated to the lay-out and graphical representation of DigComp 2.1 to increase readability for all stakeholders interested in implementing the framework. As a reminder, in the next page an overview of DigComp 2.0 is presented, indicating the changes for DigComp 2.1.

## The eight proficiency levels and examples of Section 2

## use

DigComp 1.0 Framework had three proficiency levels in Dimension 3 (foundation, inter -mediate and advanced). These have now been increased to eight levels in DigComp 2.1. A wider and more detailed range of proficiency levels supports the development of learning and training materials. It also helps in the design of instruments for assessing the development of citizens' competence, career guidance and promotion at work.

Eight proficiency levels for each competence have been defined through learning out -comes (using action verbs, following Bloom's taxonomy) and inspired by the structure and vocabulary of the European Qualification Framework (EQF). Moreover, each level description contains knowledge, skills and attitudes, described in one single descriptor for each level of each competence; this equals to 168 descriptors (8 x 21 learning out -comes). An online validation survey helped to revise a first version of the levels, and to produce a final version.

As shown in Table 1 on the following page, each level represents a step up in citizens' acquisition of the competence according to its cognitive challenge, the complexity of the tasks they can handle and their autonomy in completing the task. To illustrate this point, we could say that a citizen at level 2 is able to remember and to carry out a simple task with help from somebody with digital competence only when she/he needs it. A citizen at level 5, however, can apply the knowledge, carry out different tasks and solve prob -lems and also helps others to do so. We can also see that the first six proficiency levels of the new Framework are linked to the three levels originally identified in DigComp 1.0. A new highly-specialised level has been added to the latest version of the Framework which includes levels seven and eight. The information in Table 1 (page 13) is graphically represented on the infographics on page 14 and 15.

The Figure 1 below gives a detailed explanation of how the competences are presented in the Section 3 of this report.

- The Competence Areas (dimension 1) and their Competence title and Competence descriptor (dimension 2) appear on the vertical banner, which colour changes depending on the Competence area.
- The first row shows the names of the 8 Proficiency Levels (dimension 3) according to the version 2.1 (level 1, level 2, etc). In parallel, the name of the levels according to DigComp 1.0 is stated (Foundation, Intermediate, etc.).
- In the second row, we can see the description for each proficiency level related to the complexity of the tasks and problems and the level of autonomy, together with the description of the competence in terms of learning outcomes. Each bullet corresponds to one descriptor of the competence, and each action verbs and key words are in bold.

Figure 1: Explanation how the competences are presented

<!-- image -->

The examples of use (dimension 5 of the framework) have also been updated and contextualised in scenarios for two areas of use: employment and learning .  These illustrate the eight proficiency levels to help future implementation of DigComp 2.1.

As we can see in the Section 3 of this report, the examples of use are presented as follows:

- We include examples of proficiency levels for two areas of use: employment and learning.
- We include scenarios for each competence area and area of use in order to contex -tualise the examples.
- We have elaborated examples for the two areas of use in each proficiency levels. In this version 2.1, the examples for the 8 levels are only available in the first com -petence (1.1), for the rest of competences we provide an example per level and area of use 5 .

In order to give examples in the same number of proficiency levels and to have the same number of examples across the levels, we have followed a 'cascade' strategy: for one competence we have written the examples for one level, and in the following competence we have written the example in the following level, and so on. For ex -ample, competences 1.1 and 1.2 have has an example for level 1, competence 1.3 for level 2, competence 1.4 for level 3, etc.

The progression of the proficiency levels of the competences, their learning outcomes and practical application shown in the 'Examples of use' have been made more under -standable on the fold-out table (Competence 1.1) at page 19.

5 We do not provide examples for all the proficiency levels, because the nature of the framework is descriptive and their aim is to illustrate the proficiency levels.

Here comic strips have been used in order to showcase one example of use for an em -ployment scenario and one example of use for a learning scenario in competence 1.1.

Concretely, the comic strips allow the reader to easily understand the progression in the acquisition of a digital competence, and therefore it is a support for the stakeholders willing to implement the framework.

As well as guiding others, I can:

-  demonstrate where my own digital competence needs to be improved or updated,
- illustrate different ways to support others in the development of their digital competence.
- propose different opportunities found for self-development and to keep up-to-date with the digital evolution.

At advanced level, according to my own needs and those of others, and in complex contexts, I can:

- decide which are the most appropriate ways to improve or update one's own digital competence needs,
-  assess the development of others' digital competence.
- choose the most appropriate opportunities for self-development and to keep up-to date with new developments.

Higly Specialised

At highly specialised level, I can:

- create solutions to complex problems with limited definition that are related to improving digital competence, and to find opportunities for self-development and to keep up-to-date with new developments.
-  integrate my knowledge to contribute to professional practice and knowledge and to guide others in identifying digital competence gaps.

At the most advanced and specialised level, I can:

- create solutions to solve  complex problems with many interacting factors that are  related to improving digital competence, and to find opportunities for self-development and to keep up-to-date with the digital evolution.
-  propose new ideas and processes to the field.
