## AI literacy and competency: definitions, frameworks, development and future research directions

## 1. Introduction

The rapid integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into daily life -from generative tools like ChatGPT to predictive algorithms shaping our newsfeeds -has made AI literacy and competency urgent educational  priorities  (Chiu,  2024,  2025).  This  is  reflected  in  all  the  frameworks  proposed  by  various organizations such as the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)/European  commissions  and  the  United  Nations  Educational,  Scientific  and  Cultural  Organization (UNESCO, 2025). While often used interchangeably, AI literacy and AI competency are related but distinct concepts, operating at different levels of understanding and skill.

## 2. AI literacy vs AI competency

## 2.1. AI literacy: the foundation of awareness

AI literacy refers to a foundational conceptual understanding of AI. It focuses on knowledge, critical thinking, and ethical awareness rather than technical skill (Chiu et al., 2024; Zhou et al., 2025). AI-literate individuals can explain what AI systems are (e.g., machine learning, neural networks), identify their  real-world  applications  (like  recommendation  engines  or  facial  recognition),  and  discuss societal  implications  such  as  bias,  privacy  risks,  or  economic  disruption.  They  may  be  able  to design, manage, engage, and create with AI (OECD, 2025). The OECD framework structures AI literacy around four interaction domains: (i) Engaging with AI: Recognizing AI use and critically evaluating outputs (accuracy, bias, relevance); (ii) Creating with AI: Collaborating with AI for ideation, content generation, and problem-solving while addressing ownership/attribution; (iii) Managing AI: Strategically  delegating  tasks  to  AI  to  enhance  human  work  (e.g.,  automating  logistics  to  focus  on  team building);  and  (iv)  Designing  AI:  Understanding  the  principles  behind  AI  systems  (data,  design choices) to explore fairness and impact, even without building AI products.

This literacy empowers individuals to interact with AI responsibly -questioning outputs, recognizing  limitations,  and  making  informed  decisions  as  consumers,  citizens,  or  professionals  (Chiu, 2025).  Crucially,  AI  literacy  is  for  everyone:  students,  teachers,  policymakers,  and  the  public.  It does not require sophisticated coding ability but demands curiosity and critical engagement. AI literacy focuses on knowledge, understanding, and application of AI.

## 2.2. AI competency: the realm of action

AI competency, in contrast, denotes practical proficiency in using, engaging, interacting, developing, or managing AI systems in real-world contexts (Chiu et al., 2024, 2025; Zhou et al., 2025). It moves beyond knowledge and understanding into capacity  (Chiu  et  al.,  2024).  AI-competent  individuals should  have  the  confidence  and  ability  to  use  AI  to  complete  specific  tasks  ethically,  healthily, responsibly, and productively (Zhou et al., 2025). For example, AI-competent students could effectively use AI to support their self-regulated learning, and AI-competent programmers could effectively  integrate  AI  into  coding  tasks  to  make  computer  applications.  In  other  words,  they  are confident  and  have  great  capacity  to  clearly  explain  how  AI  technologies  work  and  impact

society. They are able to use them in an ethical and responsible manner and to effectively communicate and collaborate with them in a specific setting (Chiu et al., 2024, 2025). They should have selfreflective mindsets to critically evaluate their AI tools and knowledge. AI competency is contextual and focuses on how well individuals use AI in beneficial ways.

Overall, AI literacy is about knowledge and understanding; AI competency is about skillful application and optimization. While literacy asks, ' What does this AI do? ' competency asks, ' How can I make this AI work better? ' AI competency fundamentally depends on AI literacy; you cannot effectively optimize or troubleshoot an AI system ( ' How? ' ) without first understanding its core functions and constraints ( ' What? ' ).  Literacy  is  the  compass;  competency is  the engine. Thus, while literacy provides  the  necessary  knowledge,  competency  represents  the  higher-level  skill  of  applying  that knowledge to achieve superior outcomes and make the AI work ethically, effectively, and healthily for you.

## 3. The interdisciplinary: how diverse literacies form the foundation of AI literacy

AI is not a monolithic technology emerging from a single discipline. It is a profoundly interdisciplinary field, i.e., the foundational understanding of what AI is, what it does, and its implications cannot exist in isolation. It is intrinsically woven from a rich tapestry of other essential literacies (Chiu, 2025). Understanding  AI  requires  navigating  this  complex  intersection,  where  competence  in  one  area informs and depends on understanding in others. We discuss ten literacies relating to and underpinning AI literacy:

1. Mathematical  Literacy:  AI,  particularly  machine  learning  (ML),  relies  heavily  on  mathematical frameworks. Linear algebra underpins data representation and transformations in neural networks. Calculus is crucial for optimization algorithms that train models (like gradient descent). Probability theory is fundamental for reasoning under uncertainty, Bayesian inference, and evaluating model confidence. Without mathematical literacy, core ML concepts remain abstract and impenetrable.
2. Data Literacy: AI systems are fundamentally data-driven. Data literacy -encompassing understanding data types, sources, collection methods, cleaning, manipulation, visualization, and fundamental analysis -is paramount. It enables individuals to critically assess the quality of the data feeding AI, understand biases inherent in datasets, interpret the results AI produces, and recognize the limitations of data-driven conclusions.
3. Ethical Literacy: AI raises profound ethical questions about bias, fairness, privacy, accountability, transparency (explainability), autonomy, and societal impact. Ethical literacy provides the philosophical  frameworks  (consequentialism, deontology,  virtue,  and  ethics)  and  critical  reasoning skills necessary to identify these dilemmas, analyze potential harms and benefits, and advocate for  responsible  AI  development  and  deployment.  It  could  be  the  most  critical  companion literacy.
4. Media Literacy: AI  is  surrounded  by  hype,  misinformation,  and  powerful  narratives.  Media  literacy empowers individuals to analyze claims about AI capabilities critically, identify biases in outputs  or  reporting,  discern  deepfakes  or  AI-generated  text,  understand  the  motivations  of different stakeholders (companies, governments), and evaluate the broader societal and political implications of AI adoption. Media literacy focuses on understanding how AI shapes and is represented in information channels.
5. Computational  Literacy:  Understanding  fundamental  computing  concepts  (algorithms,  logic, hardware/software interaction, complexity) is essential to grasp how AI systems process information and execute tasks. It demystifies the ' black box ' at a basic level, explaining sequential processing and decision-making structures inherent in AI models.
6. Linguistic Literacy: Natural language processing is a cornerstone of modern AI (chatbots, translation, sentiment analysis). Linguistic literacy provides the understanding of syntax, semantics,

pragmatics,  morphology,  and  phonology  that  allows  AI  to  parse,  generate,  and  manipulate human  language.  It ' s  crucial  for  understanding  how  large  language  models  work,  the nuances of prompt engineering, and the challenges AI faces with ambiguity, sarcasm, or cultural context.

7. Visual Literacy: With the rise of computer vision and generative AI models, understanding visual information -composition, color theory, symbolism, spatial relationships, and abstraction -is increasingly important. Visual literacy helps individuals interpret AI-generated imagery, understand  how  AI  sees  and  analyzes  visual  data,  and  critically  evaluate  the  realism  or  potential manipulations in synthetic media.
8. Domain-Specific Literacy: AI is applied in  a context. Effective AI  literacy within  a  specific  field (e.g.,  education,  healthcare,  law,  finance,  engineering,  or  art)  requires  deep  understanding  of that  domain ' s  knowledge,  practices,  terminology,  and  existing  challenges.  A  medical  AI  tool requires medical literacy to understand its purpose, interpret its outputs correctly, and identify potential clinical risks or biases. AI literacy is integrated with domain expertise to enable meaningful application.
9. Scientific literacy:  the ability  to  understand, evaluate, and apply scientific knowledge directly supports  AI  literacy  by  enabling  critical  engagement  with  AI  concepts  like  machine  learning, data ethics, and algorithmic bias. Both require evidence-based reasoning, skepticism of unverified claims, and ethical reflection. A strong foundation in scientific thinking empowers individuals to navigate AI advancements responsibly and participate in shaping their societal impact.
10. Design literacy: the ability to understand and apply design principles, aligns closely with AI literacy.  Both  involve  critical  thinking,  problem-solving,  and  evaluating  choices -whether  in design or AI systems. Design thinking ' s  iterative,  user-centered  approach mirrors  AI literacy ' s focus on ethical, effective AI use and development. Recognizing design principles in AI interfaces  (e.g.,  usability,  bias  mitigation)  enhances  AI  literacy.  Conversely,  AI  literacy  expands design  literacy  by  incorporating  data-driven  decision-making.  Together,  they  foster  holistic, human-centered innovation across disciplines.

These literacies do not exist in silos; they constantly interact and inform each other within the sphere of AI literacy. For example,

- . Understanding algorithmic bias (computational/ethical/design) requires analyzing training data (data)  for  skewed  distributions  (mathematical)  that  might  reflect  societal  prejudices  (media/ ethical/design).
- . Prompt engineering (linguistic) for an image generator (visual) relies on understanding how the model encodes concepts (computational/mathematical/scientific) and is constrained by its training data (data).
- . Evaluating  a  medical  diagnostic  AI  (domain-specific)  necessitates  understanding  its  reliability (mathematical), potential data limitations (data), and ethical implications of false positives/negatives (ethical).

AI literacy is not merely adding a new technical skill; it is about developing an integrated perspective (Chiu, 2025). It requires weaving together threads of understanding from computation, mathematics,  statistics,  data  handling,  language,  visual  perception,  ethics,  critical  thinking,  human cognition, and specific application domains. Gaps in any of these foundational literacies create vulnerabilities -misunderstanding capabilities, misinterpreting outputs, overlooking biases, or failing to grasp  societal  consequences.  By  recognizing  and  cultivating  this  interdisciplinary  nature  of  AI  literacy,  individuals  can  build  the  robust  understanding  necessary  to  navigate  the  AI-driven  world thoughtfully, critically, and responsibly, forming the essential foundation upon which AI competency can then be built.

## 4. The development of AI competency

Nurturing  AI  competency  begins  with  establishing  a  foundational  understanding  of  AI  literacy -grasping  core  concepts,  capabilities,  limitations,  and  ethical  implications  (Chiu,  2025;  Zhou  et  al., 2025).  Once  this  base  is  solidified,  progression  requires  deliberate  practice  and  contextual  application. Identify specific, ethical opportunities within your domain (e.g., research analysis for researchers,  report  drafting  for  professionals,  or  lesson  planning  for  educators)  where  AI  tools -such  as translators,  ChatGPT,  or  image  generators -can  enhance  outcomes.  Start  with  small-scale  experiments:  use  AI  to  summarize  texts,  visualize  data,  or  generate  initial  content  drafts,  focusing  on tasks where human oversight ensures responsible use (Zhou et al., 2025).

Through iterative refinement and critical evaluation, transform practice into competency. Continuously  test  outputs,  adjust  prompts,  and  troubleshoot  errors  (Chiu,  2025)  while  asking,  Does this  tool  improve  efficiency  or  accuracy?  What  safeguards  prevent  misuse?  Measure  results against goals (e.g., time saved, insights gained), and integrate feedback to optimize workflows. Crucially,  anchor this process in ethical integration -maintaining transparency, auditing for bias, and preserving human judgment. Competency emerges when AI application becomes intentional, adaptive, and ethically embedded, turning literacy into measurable, context-aware excellence that drives superior outcomes. This maintains the core sequence: literacy → practice → critical  refinement → ethical integration → competency, while emphasizing action and responsibility.

## 5. Future directions

AI literacy and AI companies are new to policymakers, researchers, educators, and students. in this editorial, we suggest five research directions in terms of questions

1. Mapping and optimizing ai literacy and AI competency development: What specific pedagogical interventions and practices most effectively bridge foundational AI literacy from the eight literacies to demonstrable competency? How does the development differ across learner profiles (e.g., age, profession, prior digital skills)?.
2. The dynamics of interdisciplinary literacy integration for AI: How do the eight foundational literacies  (mathematical,  data,  ethical,  media,  computational,  linguistic,  visual,  and  domain-specific) interact dynamically during the development of AI literacy and competency? Where are the critical synergy points or friction points, and how can curricula/training be designed to foster integrated understanding rather than siloed knowledge?
3. Ethical literacy  as the active scaffold for competency: How does ethical literacy transition from theoretical awareness ( ' knowing the risks ' ) to an active, integrated practice (applying safeguards, auditing  for  bias,  ensuring  transparency)  within  the  development  and  execution  of  AI  competency?  What  frameworks  and  tools  best  support  practitioners  in  making  real-time  ethical decisions while using AI tools under pressure?
4. Equity and access in the AI literacy-to-competency pipeline: How do disparities in foundational literacies (e.g., mathematical, data, linguistic, and computational access) create barriers to developing AI literacy and, subsequently, AI competency? What are the most effective strategies for mitigating  these  barriers  and  ensuring  equitable  pathways  to  AI  competency  across  diverse populations (socioeconomic, cultural, linguistic)?
5. Culturally  Responsive  AI  literacy  &amp;  competency  frameworks:  How  do  cultural  values,  linguistic diversity, and local epistemologies shape the definition, acquisition, and application of AI literacy and competency? How can frameworks be adapted to ensure they are culturally sustaining rather than imposing techno-centric?
